            "description": "<p><em>Is this the NEW Captain America?! \"Captain America\" is back. First mission: take on A.I.M and R.A.I.D.</em></p><p>The world is in financial chaos as reports of the Kronas Corporation's CEO, Aleksander Lukin's death goes out. Oil prices have skyrocketed. Mortgage prices have gone up and people are starting to protest in the streets.</p><p>On a rooftop, the Black Widow asks Bucky if he's ready. When Bucky mentions that he told Stark he wouldn't answer to him, she says she's just there to give him a ride and help if he needs it. She tells him that there's no official record of him. The deal Stark made was a personal one as he can't be seen publicly supporting an unregistered hero. He asks how can she be with him since she's an Avenger. She tells him that the Black Widow lives among shades of grey. She tells him it's time to suit up and she's surprised he helped redesign the suit with Tony. Bucky says he just couldn't wear Steve's uniform. He is not him nor will he pretend to be. He just wants to honor his memory. Also, there's no way he'd let anyone else do it. She comments how she's seen him practicing with the shield yet he's still carrying a gun. Bucky tells her that he's one of the few that could actually handle the shield because of his arm. He still has a gun because he's always carried weapons. Now that he's got a \"red, white and blue target\" on him, he'll need them more than ever.</p><p>They see a crowd of protesters gathering. Bucky mentions that the Red Skull wants to weaken the country's economy. Their reports say that A.I.M. and R.A.I.D. were going after Wall Street's gold reserves. It's up to them to stop them.</p><p>A.I.M. and R.A.I.D. are getting ready to make their move when one is hit in the head by the shield. Captain America lives again.</p><p>Bucky thinks to himself how he hasn't handled this kind of action since the war. He's used to doing things with a stealthy approach. Charging in blindly was the way Steve did things. He has no problem adapting his methods. He knows that they have no idea who he is and seeing the shield is putting some fear into them. He thinks that he can almost feel Steve there with him.</p><p>There's four guys left. One aiming a gun at the Widow from behind. He throws the shield but it goes high above their heads bouncing off a steel structure. They laugh his attempt to stop them. To their surprise they see Captain America pull out a gun and shoot them each one time in the kneecaps. He tells them he threw his shield like that on purpose as it takes out the other agent about to shoot the Widow.</p><p>The Red Skull asks Arnim Zola if Faustus is ready for the next phase in his plans. On the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, Tony Stark is talking with the Secretary about the recent turmoil. Stark says how Kronas may be behind this. The Secretary says their just playing hardball and Stark asks how much has Kronas donated to him and his friends. The Secretary is outraged at Stark's accusation but they are interrupted by on of his agents. The missing S.H.I.E.L.D. agents have been found. They are outside the White House where a group of protesters have gathered. Fausus says \"it's time.\" The rogue agents lift their guns and begin firing into the crowd, much to Starks horror.</p>",

            "description": "<b><i></i></b><h3><b><i>Overview:</i></b></h3><b><i></i></b><br />The penultimate chapter of \"Secret Origin\"! Hal Jordan and Sinestro face off against Abin Sur's killer - Atrocitus! But what dark secret has Atrocitus uncovered about the impending \"Blackest Night?\" And what revelation will forever change the relationship between Hal and Carol Ferris?<br /><br /><b>SPOILERS</b><br /><br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Hal and Sinestro have tracked   Atrocitus to the Hand Mortuary and found him attempting to access   \"The Black\" through the blood of William Hand. </li> </ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Sinestro explains that the   Five Inversions believe that the blood of select individuals can be used   as gateways to other dimensions, and characterized these beliefs as   \"nonsense\". </li> <li>Atrocitus nearly blasts Hal   with his cosmic divining rod but misses when Sinestro tackles Hal out of   the blast path. Hal is angry and seeking to prove something while Sinestro   lectures him that \"falling back\" is a strategy and not an act of   cowardice. </li> <li>Sinestro retrieves his   lantern from it's storage in a pocket dimension with Hal remarking that he   \"keeps his in his locker\". </li> <li>The two Lanterns recharge and   take on Atrocitus. Hal's construct of a Jet is weak and easily dispatched   by the monster. Sinestro challenges Hal to concentrate harder and craft a   stronger attack. </li> <li>Atrocitus recognizes Sinestro   as \"the Greatest Green Lantern\" and finds him equally to blame   for the Guardians actions. He slams Sinestro with a yellow construction   vehicle and is poised to deliver a killing blow when Hal fashions a more detailed   and stronger jet. Hal's construct crashes into Atrocitus with tremendous   force seemingly blasting through the yellow vehicle that Atrocitus raised   as a shield. </li> <li>Sinestro refuses to believe   Hal had overcome the \"yellow weakness\" and secures his prisoner   for transport to Oa. William Hand runs off, but not before taking   Atrocitus cosmic divining rod with him. </li> <li>Sinestro challenges Hal about   his anger prompting Hal to fly off and confront the true source of his   rage, Carl Ferris. He has blamed Ferris for his father's death and his   anger was only compounded by Hal's belief that Ferris went on to live a   life of riches and indulgence. </li> <li>His ring takes him to Carol   Ferris' beachfront home where he barges in looking for Carl. Hal find's   Ferris asleep in a hospital bed, clearly dying. Carol explains that after   Martin Jordan's accident Carl Ferris wasted away, guilt ridden over his   friend's death. Carol worked hard to rebuild his business while hiding his   true condition behind stories of Carl living the good life golfing and   traveling. </li> <li>Hal realized that he had been   holding on to his anger for too long and apologized. When Carol remarked to   him that it was not easy to be alone, he told her she wasn't, indicating   the first step in their relationship. </li> <li>Back in the desert, Hal   watches as a construct of his father smiles and disperses in the wind. He   lets go of his anger and admits to Sinestro that he was right. The elder   Lantern imparts upon Hal a lesson about how Green Lanterns deal with life;   a lesson Hal would pass on to Kyle years later. The two Lanterns shake   hands as friends. </li> <li>Before parting, Hal and   Sinestro are alerted by their rings that Sinestro's mission time has   expired and that they are in violation of the Guardians territorial edicts   against fraternization between Lanterns. The story ends with their   respective rings ordering the two Lanterns to report to Oa immediately for   discipline.  </li> </ul>",
