The Hyde House is burned down to the ground during the fight. Hex tries to collect his bounty in town, but only gets money for two of the men, because the rest are unidentifiable. Dean Thomas had also hired Hex to bring both of the Hydes home alive. Hex was told he would be paid $2,000. Because Mr. Hyde died, Hex agreed to take only $1,000. The problem is that all the money the family owned was tied up in the hotel that burned to the ground. Thomas asks Kate to see if she can make a deal with Hex. <br/></p> <p>Hex and Kate Hyde show up at Dean's home and ask him to sign over the deed to the land the hotel stood on to Hex. Once that is done, Kate asks Hex what he plans to do with the land. He replies that the best thing to do is to leave it free and clear and then he rides off into the sunset. <br/><br/><br/></p>",

When the last unicorn appears in central park both Sela and Belinda are enlisted to find the magical creature for very different reasons. Sela seeks to protect the creature and guide it back home while Belinda needs it for her own evil plot. But unknown to both women a third party with malevolent plans for the creature is set to enter the game. Sela find herself in a race against time to bring the last unicorn back to its own realm before her rivals can accomplish their goals.</i></p><p> </p><p>A flashback shows Sela and Belinda shortly after the two traveled to Las Vegas together (note: the in-story reference to their journey to Vegas states to read Grimm Fairy Tales annual, when in fact this should reference the Grimm Fairy Tales Swimsuit Edition.) As the two talk with one another a Native American man at a carnival tells a legend where it is described that they are two wolves within everyone, one good and one bad, and whichever wolf succeeds is the wolf that the person feeds. the action then cuts to New York. Sela is not sure why she is there, but she quickly gets pulled away to Central Park by Shang to hunt for a unicorn. They come one of the other realms, and are at the height of their power at 100 years of age. Sela battles Belinda while Shang battles Baby Yaga. With everyone else occupied another force is capable of killing the unicorn and taking its horn. Sela could have killed Belinda but she chooses not to, and asking Shang of the significance he tells her only that it means that she really is on the side of good. The two depart to try to counteract the loss of the unicorn.</p><h4>List of covers and their creators:</h4><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Cover</th><th scope=\"col\">Name</th><th scope=\"col\">Creator(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Sidebar Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reg</td><td>Regular Cover</td><td>Di Amorim &amp; Caesar Rodriguez</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Var</td><td>Zenescope Exclusive</td><td>Norberto Fernandez &amp; Corey Knaebel</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Var</td><td>Variant Cover</td><td>Mike DeBalfo &amp; Annette Kwok</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table>",
