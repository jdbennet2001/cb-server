Everyone talks about \"getting away with murder,\" but what would you do if you were given irrefutable proof of the identity of the one that \"done you wrong,\" the opportunity to kill them and the means to get away with it, scot-free? When former gangbanger Dizzy Cordova meets the mysterious Agent Graves, she is given the opportunity of a lifetime in the form of an attache case containing the proof, the gun, and the carte blanche immunity to exact revenge for the drive-by shootings that killed her family. Now she faces the hardest decision of her life in the form of a question that has no easy answer: If you could get away with murder, and your victim truly deserved it, what would you do?</em>",

            "description": "<p><em>World War II is the setting for an atmospheric miniseries starring heroes very much like Batman, Superman and the Golden Age Justice Society of America. In 1942, as war rages around the globe, a vicious albino smuggler intercepts a parcel intended for the Axis powers, a parcel whose contents could change the outcome of the war. The always grinning ne'er-do-well plans to sell the item to the highest bidder, but the Allies have other plans, and send their top covert agents to claim the mysterious package. Now \"Owl,\" \"Clock,\" \"Bat\" and a host of other very familiar costumed characters battle for the safety of an Elseworld in JSA: THE LIBERTY FILES, a 2-issue Prestige miniseries by the Doctor Strange: Servant of Bones team of co-writer Dan Jolley and co-writers/artists Tony Harris and Ray Snyder. In addition to interior pencils, Harris also provides stirring painted covers for both issues of THE LIBERTY FILES, and even STARMAN readers familiar with his intepretations of classic Golden Age characters will be surprised at how well he integrates the JSA, Batman, Robin, and others into unexpected settings, facing Egyptian thugs, Nazi troops and undead assassins, among them a deadly monster known as the Scarecrow. As the fate of the world hangs in the balance, heroes change allegiances, fall prey to horrible fates, and stand together in the face of a threat no one could have anticipated: an alien super-man who serves the Nazi cause.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>When Brian Basset first created his strip, Adam, it had a Mr. Mom theme running through it. It was unusual at the time for a man to stay home while his wife played the corporate games-even if he was working-and Basset used the situation to its fullest comic potential. These days, however, home-based offices are increasingly common, and Basset finds he was merely leading a trend.That's one reason the creator of this charming cartoon changed the name of his strip last year to Adam@home. In this sixth collection, the one-time Mr. Mom focuses on a whole host of compatriots who hang out at the local coffee cafe, log in remotely, and compare work-at-home notes. In Cafe Adam, an all-new Adam@home collection, Basset mines the laughs in all sorts of home-office and coffee-house-based dramas, including keeping in good standing with the local barista (no jokes about the nose ring), dealing with client complaints by handing over the phone to a screaming infant son, and helping out his kids' class at school. He also revels in the little things, from changes the nearby Kopyko made for workers like himself to being able to attend an office Christmas party, even if it's virtual.Through it all, Adam's wife, Laura, who still has to show up for her job at a local bookstore, and his kids, Katy, Clayton, and Nick, help the Newman household retain its balance. An engaging family, the Newmans have become an essential source of amusement for Basset's countless fans.</em></p>",

And Chairface has the right weapon to use: the Devolution Materializer, which can make perfect duplicates of The Tick. Well, not quite perfect. The problem with the Devolution Materializer is that it makes \"devolved\" duplicates. That means the \"Ticks\" it produces are \"devolved\" versions of The Tick primitive, rough, crude, downright \"uncivilized.\" How will a modern, civilized, couth Tick deal with his primitive, uncivilized, uncouth \"devolved\" copies? And what happens when other eager super-villains get their hands on the Devolution Materializer? Read the entire exciting story in The Tick's Big Year 2000 Spectacle #1!</em></p>",

As they wage a horrific battle in a dread-fueled world overrun by the Powers of Darkness, scores of refugees search for fragments of faith and hope.</em></p><p><em>Witness the horrors that Daniel Llanso's death sets in motion for his survivors. Will the Spawn he was reborn to be succumb to his role as Hell's general and rule accordingly?

            "description": "<p><em>Alphrodite is a masterpiece of French 19th century literature. This classical tale of sensuous love was one of the best-selling novels of its time. Published in 1896, Aphrodite made Pierre Louys famous and was by far his greatest success, surpassing that of his other well-know works such as The Songs of Bilitis. Conceived as a novel of the antiquity focusing on women and on light, Aphrodite lends itself naturally to illustration.</em></p><p><em>Book One, illustrated by Milo Manara - The story takes place in Alexandria in the 1st Century BC where Demetrios, a renowned artist falls in love with a courtesan, Chrysis. She asks him to prove his love to her by committing three crimes and Demetrios agrees. In this volume, Manara lets his imagination run wild as he illustrates a part of this novel.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>In the late 1980s, long before his work on the Eisner and Harvey-nominated Fred the Clown, Roger Langridge worked with his brother Andrew on a comic called Art d'Ecco. In these early stories, done mainly (but seldom entirely) for laughs, one can see the beginnings of the formal playfulness that would characterize the later work of both Langridge brothers, and of the elaborate layering of subtle and not-so-subtle nods and references to the world of music, film and literature.</em></p>",
