History is changing thanks to Booster Gold having saved Ted Kord from Maxwell Lord. A time storm is coming and Rip gives Daniel a new Supernova costume.</p><p>In the present, Booster and Ted are being chased by OMACs. Booster is surprised because he thought they had all been stopped. History has been changed. Ted calls up one of his spare bugs to fly them out of there. Because Max had used some of Kord Industry tech, Ted is able to reprogram the OMACs into thinking they're just another OMAC flying around.</p><p>At the Chessmate headquarters in the Swiss Alps, Max receives an update on the deceased heroes, including Dr. Mid-Nite, Black Lightning, Lightning, Thunder, Nightwing, Cyborg, Black Canary, Hawkgirl and most recently Kyle Rayner (with his ring now in their possession). He then gets word that Booster and Blue Beetle are still alive. He wants them found.</p><p>Ted and Booster discover that every major city is being watched over by OMACs. Max is in complete power. Ted picks up a distress signal from England coming from the old Justice League International headquarters. They sneak inside through a tunnel Aquaman had installed. Inside they find Catherine Cobert, their old liaison.</p><p>Catherine fills them in on what has happened when the OMACs began hunting down the heroes. Brother EYE took out the JLA watchtower and several heroes are either dead or missing. It seems that Batman is gone and Superman has become Max's secret weapon. Max is controlling him with his mind powers. Catherine tells them that there's been rumors of a resistance growing which is why she activated the old distress signal.</p><p>Ted tells Booster that they need to get to Rip's time sphere and fix things. When Catherine overhears this, she transforms into an OMAC and attacks them. It's a trap! Booster tries contacting Skeets to send them some help as they are now targeted for elimination. As they begin fighting the OMAC, things appear really bad by the two heroes that arrive to help them. Green Arrow and Hawkman are working side by side.</p><p>250 million years ago, the Black Beetle shows up and takes Booster's dad (in the old Supernova suit) to the Vanishing Point. A meeting of the Time Stealers is now in session.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Team Arrow follows the trail of those responsible for shooting Connor Hawke to London and finds out who was behind that heinous act.</em></p><p><strong><em>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead</em></strong></p><p>Ollie, Dinah and Speedy stare at disbelief at the aliens on the floor. They ask Hal Jordon in help with extraterrestrial aliens. He reveals that they are just humans wearing alien costumes. Speedy discovers that the men in the alien costumes are from New Jersey. Back in a hotel room, the both of them are tied up and the three are ready to interrogate them. However, they take a different approach, and introduce to them a man wearing underwear with a clown face, and very old woman wearing furry white underwear with bunny ears and a sheep with a biker's hat on its head. The two men, scared of the possibilities, confess that it was \"some English guy\".</p><p>At London, Speedy sits at a bar and spots a man with a long beard, a woman with glasses and a gangster of some sort wearing a red cap. Speedy then meets a stranger who offers her a drink but she refuses. The gangster in a red cap then says \"Dodger\" and the strange man reveals a charge weapon, and throws it towards him which creates an explosion. Speedy then grabs him and throws him to the ground, with Dinah and Ollie in the bar as well. Dodger then throws another explosive towards Dinah and Ollie. Ollie grabs an arrow of his, and Dodger throws another explosive which causes Ollie to jump out of the way. Dinah then goes up behind Dodger with a sword to his throat. Dodger explains himself and says that paying him a good amount of money to him will give him them the information they need.</p><p>On the rooftop of the bar, Ollie asks Dodger if it's an actual alien space craft. Dodger replies, by saying he doesn't know, and he suggested that they wear alien costumes for payback, as the Americans were calling him \"tea bag\". Dinah then asks who had had it five weeks ago, and Dodger mentions \"cabal of killers\" which Ollie reacts to. Dinah then recognises that Dodger is talking about the League of Assassins. Dodger says confirms that, and asks them if they've ever heard of them. Ollie replies, by saying that they're employed by Ra's Al Ghul.</p>",

This month’s co-features focus on Hawkman, Gangbuster, John Stewart and the intriguing new psychic known as Tarot!</em></p><p>SPOILERS</p><p>Superman scans out in space where the pocket solar system that appeared over Metropolis was. He detects the same energy residue that appeared over Gotham and Washington also. Returning to the Hall of Justice, they confirm that it is similar to creation energies and decide to check on the Cosmic Egg where Krona is still trapped.</p><p>Batman and Vixen are going through the JLA database to figure out who the wolf-creature that attacked Wonder Woman was. Batman can't get over the feeling that he's seen it somewhere before. Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl try to figure out what the symbol means on Diana's back. It turns out that the symbol has changed a second time. Hawkgirl seems to think that they look Egyptian.</p><p>Just then, Hawkman and Gangbuster arrive (via teleporter). Gangbuster tells them about Tarot being kidnapped by \"forces beyond any simple street gang\" and Hawkman mentions all the museum artifacts being stolen around the world. It seems they are being taken by Gotham-based criminals (which ticks off Batman).</p><p>Suddenly Batman interrupts Hawkman and places an emergency call to Nightwing. Nightwing tells him that just last week the Calendar Man tried robbing the Cloisters Museum and just now Mr. Freeze took some evidence that were in police custody, a jeweled sword, a mystical chalice and three amulets. Batman tells him to call Robin, Oracle, the Titans and the Outsiders. He wants to know who is behind all of this. Then Batman tells Hawkman to keep working with Gangbuster. He says Oracle will contact him and he will get any assistance he needs from the League or Titans.</p><p>Hawkman is not happy with being ordered around by Batman and starts to object. Vixen asks what there's such a priority to find Tarot. Wonder Woman tells her that Batman has just recognized the symbols as she has. Hawkman notices them and says they are ancient Egyptian tarot symbols: Strength, the High Priestess and the World. The Trinity connection is there again.</p><p>On Krechin, the largest moon of Itatoq, Despero ponders how to use the power from his just won battle. Morgaine and Enigma appear and Enigma says Despero can become a Lord of Creation if he chooses.</p><p><em><strong>Away From Creation</strong></em></p><p>John Stewart tells Firestorm about Kronos.</p>",

After he tackles an takes care of each of them he releases the caged animals they had on their truck. Finding the taste of lead all too much before he realizes why they had the animals Nuclear Fallout Protocol. He drives off saying they have Kitty and if anything happens to her he will never forgive himself.</p><p>2 Days earlier Wolverine walks into Kitty's room getting ready to yell at her for using his razor when he hears her crying. Asking her whats wrong she tells him she thinks she overheard Colossus having a conversation with another woman an is jealous that its his girlfriend an that she never had a chance to express her feelings. Wolverine still not actually caring about the problem at hand is asked to spy on him to which he replies \"Yeah sure, there aint anything on tv tonight anyway.\"</p><p>As both Wolverine an Kitty follow Piotr Wolverine tells her that she needs to tell Piotr her feelings cause this kind of stuff is getting to his reputation. Soon Colossus stops at an airport an two people step out from the plane an speak in Russian. Colossus tells the woman they should not have contacted him, but the woman insists that they needed to meet an he had to come with them. A voice comes from the plane an soon the person blasts out from the plane that very person is Crimson Dynamo an he flies towards Wolverine an Kitty. Immediately attacking Wolverine with a blast Crimson has the upper hand an Kitty rushes to go make sure Colossus is alright. Colossus tries to tell his Russian friends that Kitty an Logan are friends but the woman Darkstar tells him their problem is a matter of life an death for their country and blasts Colossus knocking him unconscious while Vanguard lifts him an takes him into the plane telling the pilot to take off. Crimson mocking Wolverine is soon overpowered by Wolverine for a brief moment, As Wolverine fights with Dynamo Kitty phases through the plane only to be blasted by Vanguard knocking her unconcious. He an Darkstar marvel at her phasing abilities saying that they may have come for one savior and found two. As Wolverine an Dynamo's fight continues Logan notices the plane reving up an knows Kitty is still on the plane let alone Piotr. Taking his mind off the fight Dynamo is able to shock him an make his way back to the plane asking why they are also taking the girl but Darkstar tells him she is of use.</p><p>Reeling from the shock Wolverine gets on his bike an begins to chase the plane. He raises to catch up with the plane an leaps up onto the wheel but as he grabs the wheel the air bursts an he slams his head onto the underside of the wheel. Falling unconscious for a few moments he is now \"in flight\" and falling fast. Finally he makes contact slamming into rock after rock an falling limp onto the snow of Russia saying \"Considering the amount of pain I'm in it will take 24 hours to completely heal....24 hours to payback time.\" Falling asleep he awakes 18 hours later saying \"I still got it.\"</p><p><strong>Present</strong></p><p>Finally at the nuclear plant he finds that its not like any plant he has seen. He begins to investigate as he contemplate this whole thing being his fault an that if he hadn't told Kitty to go after Piotr she would never be in this. A guard comes to investigate him only to get the tar beaten out of him. Soon he finds the others and another man in a hazmet suit. Dynamo talking to a man named Mikhail telling him how else were they going to be able to use her an get what they needed done. Soon Kitty comes up from where she was within the ground holding her breath. He screams out that she can only phase long as she can hold her breath, an begins running down to her telling her only a few more feet. Dynamo reaches down to her an cant get a hold of her she is still intangible then she...takes a breath. Becoming tangible she cant take it an her body goes limp her eyes still wide open Logan saying \" I was suppose to keep you safe...\" he lies her down closing her eyes her feet still in the ground and then begins to laugh saying one word \"Four\". Then as the four of the Russian mutants look at him his claws burst out an he looks up \"Theres only four of you, I almost feel sorry for you.\" an he bursts forward at them roaring.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The epic saga of the God of Thunder continues as the Marvel Masterworks present another volume of Mighty Thor masterpieces by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby! And there’s no holds barred from these masters of storytelling from page one: The evil Loki, God of Mischief, has created a dilemma of Asgardian proportions (’natch!). Only with the medical skill of his guise as Dr. Donald Blake can Thor save the life of the lovely Lady Sif, but only with the power of Thor can he keep Loki at bay!</i></p><p><i>Meanwhile, in the darkened depths, a threat greater than any Thor has ever before faced rises when the malignant Mangog threatens to unsheathe the Odinsword and bring Ragnarok upon the Norse gods. It’s a tale considered by many to be Lee and Kirby’s most-pulse pounding Asgardian epic—need we say more?</i></p><p><i>We do! Because with Stan and Jack there’s always more amazing revelations around the corner. Like the startling secret hidden from Donald Blake and a galaxy-spanning adventure that includes the origin of Galactus and a melee that pits Thor and Ego the Living Planet up against the infamous world devourer!</i></p><p><i>Collecting THOR #153-162</i></p>",

Early on, she sees things like an imposter shaman being thrashed by a dragon of the deep, and doesn't understand that none of her schoolmates can see such things. Her powers make her the amorous target of hedonistic demons even as a child. Long shielded from the reality of her power, she finally learns the secret of her mother's death, and why her grandmother was never able to leave their village. Enter Sunbi's world in this mind-boggling psychological chiller!</em></p>",
