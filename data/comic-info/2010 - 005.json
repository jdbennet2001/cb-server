            "description": "<p><i>Optimus Prime and Spike Witwicky have a chat that could define the future of Autobot and human relations! But lest you think it's all talky-talk, back at Rodimus' camp something big happens, something <strong><u>very</u></strong> big. A game-changing event in IDW's Transformers, with a <strong>Don Figueroa</strong> double-page spread that has to be seen to be believed!</i></p><p>It starts off with Spike Witwicky keeping an eye on Optimus Prime, who had willingly let himself be taken prisoner by the humans. Spike admits to Optimus that he does not trust him, but Optimus completely understands because after all his race had done when they came to Earth, it would be hard for anyone from Earth to trust his kind. Spike then asks if the reason he turned himself in is because he feels guilty, but Optimus responds saying that it's because he had once been a soldier who had understood how to win battles, which is why he became a leader and although he thought he knew what it meant for a leader to lead, it took him thousands of years for him to actually learn it. And the whole time, all he was really doing was leading everyone more into the war, and now it seems that they have become enemies with the humans. After all the battle stress that had been on him for so long, he realized he was no longer effective as a leader because his actions had led them to become enemies with the humans and he didn't want that. He knew that they needed to change, so he willingly turned himself in for what his leadership had brought to the Earth. He then applauds Spike for his leadership saying that the humans have the ability to learn in such a short time what it took him ages to understand. He then tells him that he has been the one to learn from the humans rather than they learning from him and he chooses to remain his prisoner because he will never doubt the humans' capacity for wisdom. Spike asks him then what he thinks his men will do without him to which Optimus replies that he hopes that they will transform. Meanwhile, Ultra Magnus returns and reports that Rodimus and his group of deserters have created a ship to leave the planet and have been colluding with Decepticons. He then says that he needs a unit to return and arrest him. Bumblebee asks how he knows that he's really working with the Decepticons, and Magnus says that he saw it with his own optics and is certain taht Rodimus has joined the enemy. He orders Blurr to come with him, but Bumblebee says that he's just suffered severe trauma and can't just go back out into the field again, but Magnus says that this is a charge of treason, so a legal matter supercedes Bumblebee's own authority as commander of the team. In the meantime, Spike Witwicky takes a break to think about a lot of things while waiting for his next meeting with the general. During this time, he drives around in a car, unaware that it is really the Stunticon Breakdown. He talks to it wondering if it is a robot too, when all of a sudden, two other stunticons attack him, planning on killing him without any concern for Breakdown because they plan on simply repairing him afterwards. Spike fights back with a gun, and manages to outrun them for a short time until Motormaster appears in front of the road and Spike is forced to jump out of Breakdown and into a nearby river, where he then calls Skywatch to pick him up. Rodimus in the meantime is talking with Prowl wondering what the Decepticons are doing with Breakdown. They think that he's just being repaired, though it gets suspicious how they're taking so long to do so when they are almost done with the space ship. But then, Ultra Magnus arrives and says that Rodimus and his gang are all under arrest. Rodimus protests saying that what he's doing isn't treason and that they don't have sides anymore and he's just working towards a common goal for peace. He asks Bumblebee if he's really okay with rounding them all up and if he learned anything from Col. Horiuchi, and Bumblebee says that he was okay with him leaving and that he tried working with the humans, but he doesn't understand why Rodimus is with a bunch of Decepticons. Magnus however says that Bumblebee has no authority in the situation and whatever he has to say doesn't matter. Swindle then comes up and says he'll take it from there. Rodimus tries to tell him that he has it under control, but Swindle insists on taking over. Swindle then tells Magnus that there is no \"us\" anymore and that they're taking the ship and they're going to kill as many of Magnus' team as they can before they leave. Magnus taunts him saying that they have Swindle outnumbered, but then Swindle reveals a surprise as the Stunticons all merge together into Menasor. Swindle then orders Menasor to kill Magnus first....</p>",

M.O.D.O.K. overhears Doctor Doom thinking out loud and devises a plan. He would like to exploit Hulk's vast intelligence via a fractal to \"stupify\" the rest of the heroes in Super Hero Squad. M.O.D.O.K heads for Super Hero Park to create a scene and draw the Squad's attention. The Super Hero Squad arrives and tries to stop all the commotion when he springs the trap, \"hulking out\" the entire squad. The team of super villains attacks. Hulk drops the fractal and everyone is returned to normal and they chase the villains away. </p><h3>A Very Loki Day! </h3><p>Loki is sulking in Asgard, jealous of Thor's popularity with everyone. He looks into his \"mystic scrying pool\" to see what the squad is up to. He sees them in Super Hero Park all hulked-out and decides to take advantage of their temporary state. He teleports in, grabs Thor, and returns to the castle. He tries to show Thor off to the Asgardians in his \"stupid state\" to humiliate him and gain favor over him. When this doesn't work, he takes Thor-Hulk to see Odin and Frigga for the same reason. They pay no attention and so Loki tries one more time in front of the Warriors Three. Soon after Thor is returned to normal for no apparent reason and captures Loki. </p><h3>Unstung Hero!</h3><p>Ant-Man is riding on the back of a bumblebee through Super Hero Park when he runs into the Heroes. Just as he stops to chat, they're all Hulked-out. Hank, being one of the most intelligent Marvel characters, retains his brains even as Ant-Hulk. He knows how to return everyone to normal as he saw the fractal in (the real) Hulk's hand. He makes way towards it. Flying through the battle he reaches Hulk's hand and is able to pry it from his grasp--turning all heroes back to normal. He fly's away.</p>",

It's payback time, as fledgling vampire Pearl Jones finally confronts the vicious Hollywood coven that left her for dead, and Will Bunting reveals the final, shocking chapter in the saga of James Book and his deadliest adversary, American vampire Skinner Sweet. Be there for the unforgettable, double conclusion to the first arc of AMERICAN VAMPIRE.</em></p><p>“Curtain Call”. 1925. Pearl Jones and Henry Preston arm themselves with wooden weapons and confront B. D. Bloch and two associates. They defeat two with stakes and Pearl kills B. D. Bloch by exposing him to the sun. Pearl then confronts Hattie Jones on a movie set. In a flashback, we learn that Hattie intentionally turned herself into a vampire by cutting herself with the knife she cut Pearl with in the last issue. Pearl kills Hattie using the golden star from her dressing room.</p><p>Later, on a boardwalk, Pearl and Henry discuss their future plans. While Henry is briefly gone, Skinner Sweet approaches Pearl and tells her that he had been thinking about killing her, but changed his mind. Skinner says goodbye, but tells Pearl it “won’t be the last time”. Henry returns and he and Pearl begin the next stage of their lives together.</p><p>“If the Right Hand Offend Thee, Cut It Off”. 1912. Will Bunting continues his reading of “Bad Blood” at a bookstore. Three years after having been turned into a vampire, James Book struggles with his nature. He resorts to feeding on small animals to quench his thirst and hires quack doctors to try and cure him.</p><p>Back in Lakeview, men hired by Mr. Percy unearth Skinner Sweet with the intention of escorting him back to Percy. Sweet kills the men and eventually finds Percy’s mansion. Percy offers Sweet a deal – to join Percy and the old world vampires. Sweet declines by dragging Percy into the sunlight on his lawn and killing him. Skinner leaves muttering about his “plans”.</p><p>Book finally begs Abilena Camillo to kill him. Abilena agrees, but under the condition that Book sleeps with her that night. They make love and Abilena shoots Book under the moonless night. Later, Abilena visits Book’s gravesite with their daughter. Back at the book reading, Bunting says that Book never gave in to Sweet and that is the happiest ending he can offer. During a book signing, a shaken man from the audience hands Bunting a letter from Sweet that mocks Bunting and his mortality. The first story arc ends with Sweet standing outside the bookstore and he is being watched by an older Abilena Camillo and her daughter Felicia. Apparently the two have future plans for Skinner Sweet.</p>",

One’s a beautiful and aloof vinyl-clad it-girl and the other’s literally a dog-boy in stinky jeans and a biker jacket. But they end up together, adopted by the same tribe of nomads, and on opposite ends of the class spectrum: Rachel (a.k.a. “Sublime”) is worshipped and adored while Michael (a.k.a. “Evo”) spends each day in forced humiliation. In this strange and dangerous world, are team loyalties a factor at all? “The Beautiful People” part 5 of 8 is a harsh look at an ugly reality.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The ten-issue vampire epic on the bayou from the writer of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels continues in issue five! From the New York Times Best-selling author, George R. R. Martin, comes a tale of vampire clans, death and debauchery, legendary blood masters, and even a few epic steamboat races on the muddy Mississippi. This is Martin's FEVRE DREAM, an antebellum story of power, loss, and the fever of bloodlust. It's time for Joshua York to tell Abner Marsh the truth. No, the REAL truth. All of it. And Marsh isn't going to like most of it, but there's a war coming, and if he's going to pick sides, he needs to know what he's in for. Blood and pain, good and evil, truth and lies -- this issue brings everything to light, just in time for the coming darkness: Damon Julian. Each issue of this stunning full-color epic is illustrated by Rafa Lopez, an artist whose skilled line captures every moonlit drop of blood in delicious detail. Adapted by the Hugo-nominated author Daniel Abraham, this version of FEVRE DREAM stays faithful to Martin's original dark vision, while bringing the torture and joy of his vampires to almost-human life. This haunting series is available with Regular and Wraparound painted covers by Felipe Massafera and a very limited Nightmare retailer incentive.</i></p>",

Only a study in teamwork with Earth's Mightiest Heroes can help our grieving heroes make the grade! Lesson #2: Think twice before inviting family over. A friendly house call from the Juggernaut or Polaris, the daughter of Magneto himself, isn't the summertime bliss the brochure may have described! Lesson #3: Battling a bevy of baddies including Mesmero, Blastaar, the Red Raven, Warlock and Computo may cause cramps. Be sure to stretch before jumping into this pool! And for extra credit you can pull an all-nighter with the origins of Iceman and Beast, along with a rare solo story featuring the Angel!

And it all starts off with the history-making Human Torch/Sub-Mariner team-up by the titanic talents Carl Burgos and Bill Everett! Then the Human Torch's sidekick Toro, the Flaming Kid, makes his Marvel Mystery debut. Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner, takes his uniquely anarchic brand of action straight to the Nazis' noses, while the Angel's origin is revealed and he begins a multi-part crusade against the sexy villainess, the Cat's Paw.
