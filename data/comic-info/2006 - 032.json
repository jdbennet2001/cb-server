            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>The New X-Men are still reeling from the events of last issue, but the real concern is: Where has Wither been this whole time? After leaving the Mansion, Wither set out on his own...but what has he been up to? Find out here. Also, what does Selene have to do with all this?!</p><p>Wither is now living among the homeless and destitute in Mutant Town. He is sharing a space with an elderly woman he has befriended. He continues to have nightmares about his powers and what they did to his long-time crush and classmate, Laurie Collins. He is being watched over by Wolfsbane at Emma Frost’s request, as she explains to Mercury who is worried about Kevin given all that’s happened there since M-Day. Wither continues to fight using his power. His elderly friend tries to convince him to embrace what he is. When police investigating a string of murders involving withered corpses come to arrest the elderly woman, they shoot her before Kevin’s eyes. In anguish, he uses his powers to kill them. The elderly woman is revealed to be Selene, the former Black Queen of the Hellfire Club. She tells him that she will grant his heart’s desire if he embraces his power. They kiss and he agrees. Lucinda Guthrie visits the Institute for a memorial service for her son, Jay and the others lost since M-Day. She is greeted by Dust who blames herself for Icarus’ death. Lucinda comforts her and tells her it isn’t her fault. She then gives a eulogy telling everyone how much Jay loved them and espousing her continuing dedication to Xavier’s dream. This is followed by a general memorial for all those lost since the Decimation and in the pursuit of Xavier’s dream.</p>",

Dibny finds a mystical amulet in the snow, and they are attacked by a giant yeti. The yeti is about to go ape on Dibny when a musical whistle stops it in its tracks and causes an avalanche. Dibny is engulfed in snow, but can see a shadowy figure in the mist.</p><p>Dibny is levitated into the gates of Nanda Parbat by a member of China's Great Ten, the Accomplished Perfect Physician.</p><p>Week 32, Day 2.</p><p>San Francisco. Titans Tower.</p><p>The Teen Titans are holding an open membership call at the Titans Tower, and it is full to the brim with recipients of Luthor's metagene therapy. Suddenly, out of the sky, come Osiris and Sobek, his anthropomorphic crocodile friend. Osiris asks Beast Boy, Raven and Captain Marvel Jr. if he can join the Teen Titans, but is asked to leave. Captain Marvel Jr. tells him that the reputation of Black Adam is too evil to trust Osiris and his powers, even though he has been doing a great deal of good lately. This greatly hurts Osiris, who was hoping to make friends. Captain Marvel Jr. tells Osiris that if he can convince the world of the newfound goodness of the Black Marvel Family, he'll help Osiris join the Teen Titans.</p><p>Week 32, Day 3.</p><p>Animal Man and Adam Strange argue as Lobo scrounges through the remains of one of Lady Styx's ships for supplies.

Dibny reveals that he's gone to Nanda Parbat to see the patron goddess, Rama Kushna, to ask her about bringing his wife, Sue, back to life.</p><p>The Accomplished Perfect Physician enters the room and reveals that the yeti is one of his men, Hu Wei, who discarded the amulet which kept his power in check and ran wild. The A.P.P. used his magical whistling abilities - which can both heal and destroy - to stop the yeti, but he wants Dibny's help in tracking it down and putting its amulet back on.</p><p>Dibny and the A.P.P. go back into the mountains in search of the yeti, and soon find it. The A.P.P. distracts the monster, and Dibny is able to slip the amulet onto it, returning the yeti back to its human form. As soon as he is done his task, a monk comes to tell him that Rama Kushna will see him.</p><p>Dibny is led into a sacred chamber, where the giant female face of Rama Kushna addresses him and tells him there is no death, that it is an illusion, but disappears before giving Dibny all of the answers he needs.</p><p>Week 32, Day 7.</p><p>Dibny and the helmet of Dr. Fate prepare to leave Nanda Parbat. They say goodbye to the A.P.P. and go on to seek more answers.</p><p>Plus: The Origin of Blue Beetle with Cully Hamner</p>",
