            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>In a double-sized anniversary issue, an intergalactic bounty hunter has chased a highly prized Alien fugitive to Earth – and </p><p>She-Hulk and her new partner are caught in the crossfire! Plus, why exactly did Jen Walters leave the superhero life behind? Also, two extra special backups featuring the rise of malevolent Man-Elephant and the Jade Giantess visits the Marvel offices!</p><p><strong><em>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead!</em></strong></p><p>Somewhere in Jersey, Jennifer is describing to Jazinda what the man that blew up the bar, Bran, looks like. Jazinda then points out that there's a match in the FBI database and says that his last known address was in Cleveland. Jazinda suggests that  they call the authorities because there's no bounty, but Jennifer replies saying that not everything's about bounties.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, a couple are having a petty argument over setting up the tent, and the wife realises that they're fighting again. The husband tells her that there's plenty of blame to go around. They took this camping trip to get their problems solved in their marriage. The both look up to the sky, and the wife points out a shooting star. However, the \"star\" makes an acute turn and the wife and husband are both stunned.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jazinda and Jennifer are driving along in their RV and Jazinda points out that Jennifer hasn't really been happy as of late. She asks Jennifer if she's enjoying her work. Jennifer replies that it's okay as it pays the bills. Jazinda points out that perhaps it's not as fulfilling as what she used to do, and that was being a hero. Jazinda asks another question when Jennifer blanks out at the light outside, and Jazinda yells out that something has hit the overhead of the RV. She-Hulk makes her way up to the head of the RV and punches what appears to be an alien ship, sending it flying back, but it makes a comeback and flies right towards She-Hulk. She then flies into the tree truck, breaking it. Jazinda asks her if she's okay, and She-Hulk tears apart the alien ship and finds another alien in here. The alien begs for help. She-Hulk is surprised by this but then disregards the idea, thinking not to get involved in this. Jazinda asks what's happening, and and Sh-e-Hulk tells her it's nothing. Jazinda however, knows him as an alien race called \"Froma\". Jazinda and Cazon, as he introduces himself as, find they have something in common about not understanding what Jennifer's on about when using metaphors and comparisons. Jennifer tells Jazinda that they're going but Jazinda refuses. Jennifer then says that if she's going with this alien, then the both of them are over. With that, she walks off.</p><p>Back at the camp of the couple, the wife points out a noise coming from the bush. The husband says it could be a bear. He runs inside, and the woman is confronted with this huge alien when the husband comes out from the tent with a gun. The alien grabs the gun from the husband and tells him not to do that again. The alien says that he will not kill him merely because he stood up for \"his female\" because on his planet, they would kill each other if they could. With that, he takes the food from the BBQ. The wife then says, \"I'll break down the tent,\" and the husband says, \"I'll get the grill.\"</p><p>Back in the woods, Jazinda is still convincing Jennifer to help out Cazon. Jennifer asks Jazinda what happened to her, because she used to be a hardened bounty hunter, that was only in it for the business. Jazinda replies that with more time she's spent with humans, the more time she wonders if altruism will go away. As they continue arguing, Jennifer realises that she's lost, and Jazinda replies, \"In more ways than one.\" Jennifer replies that she's sick of this whole hero thing. There are so many fakes out there calling themselves heroes just because they have power, and they're laughing at people like her, who is the real hero. And because people keep getting hurt; other heroes, herself and bystanders as well. Just then, they hear a roar and find the alien, named Badoon, who took the couple's food reeling Cazon in with a rope. Jazinda tells Badoon to let go, and she pulls out a Terran gun. She fires the gun when Badoon surprise attacks her. She-Hulk then interrupts, holding Badoon by the neck and finishes him off. Meanwhile, Cazon and Jazinda run off when they run into the couple that was camping from before. Cazon then says that there are more humans they can take, being able to use them as hostages or shields. The husband tells Cazon that she will not be using her as a hostage. Cazoon then replies then they could easily use them as fodder, and breaks the woman's back. Jazinda then reminds him he was accused of mass murder and asks how someone innocent could just do such a thing. Cazon interrupts, saying that he never mentioned he was innocent. With that, he shoots Jazinda with the gun from before and leaves her on the ground, taking the husband from the couple</p>",

Tony Stark, discredited, humiliated and stripped of his command, struggles to uncover a diabolical plot that could spell the end of mankind. Betrayed by his peers, isolated by his obsessions, Stark finds that his only allies are the demons of his past and, hamstrung by obsolete technology, Iron Man is confronted by his archenemy, The Mandarin. Also included: Iron Man movie Preview, The Many Armors of Iron Man by Bob Layton, a reprint of Iron Man's Origin from April's Iron Man Omnibus, and a preview of Iron Man: Viva Las Vegas by Director Jon Favreau and Adi Granov!.</em></p><p>The Mandarin attempts ton convince Maya to unlock the airborne Extremis PCD, telling her the government demands it and will destroy his company if she refuses. Meanwhile, Samson explains the reason for Stark's hallucinations: Stark's Extremis-enhanced mind, processing more information than he can consciously cope with, is storing excess data in the section of the brain normally used for guilt, and providing him vital information through visions of those whose deaths he blames himself. Stark realizes that Maya's absence from his hallucinations means she isn't dead.</p><p>Maya angrily calls Kooning to berate him for demanding the removal of Extremis' PCD safeguard. Realizing what Mandarin is trying to do, he tells her not to unlock her programming. Seconds later Iron Man and Samson break into Kooning's house and interrogate him. He eventually admits contacting Prometheus Gentech to use Extremis in new super-soldier experiments, but is horrified when Tony tells him he has been working with the Mandarin. As Iron Man races across the country he orders Dugan to ready a tactical of Extremis test incubators filled with people, but is caught by the Mandarin? He explains he plans to evolve humanity with Extremis, despite his being among the 97,5% that will die. Seconds later, Iron Man breaks into the facility and attacks him.</p>",

Is Ms. Marvel on the front lines of the Secret Invasion... or is she part of the invasion?! Brian Reed (CAPTAIN MARVEL) welcomes new series artist Adriana Melo onboard as Ms. Marvel begins her third year of action and adventure!</p><p><i>Flashback to before Carol became Ms. Marvel.</i></p><p>Working as head of Security for NASA, Carol accompanies Dr. Walter Lawson (Captain Mar-Vell) to a site where an alien object has landed. Lawson is sure it's of Skrull design but keeps this to himself.</p><p>Later Carol decides to check the object herself. Touching it, the orb scans her DNA and sends the information across the universe to a member of the Skrull Empire, Rm'Twr. Another Skrull is upset that they simply received data on another simple human. Rm'Twr insists they will catalog it the same. Their future plans may require as many Earth samples as they can get.</p><p><i>In the present.</i></p><p>Tony Stark talks with Agent Sum that Carol Danvers is, in fact, a Skrull. Sum doesn't believe it. Stark shows him a video from four days ago (when Carol and Lighting Storm were on Monster Island). The video shows \"Carol\" in front of Stark Tower at the same time. The problem now is that the real Carol has left the minicarrier before he could talk to her and she's been gone for two days. They have no idea if she's been taken or not.</p><p>In her temporary home in a hotel, Carol decides to go check out an old A.I.M. base disguised as a laundry mat that has recently opened after being shut down. As soon as she enters, everyone pulls out guns and opens fire on her. Making her way down several levels, she sees a moving truck take off. It manages to leave before she can stop it.</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>At Cape Canaveral, Lawson is doing a final check on a space shuttle before it launches. Carol insists on going with him despite his protests. Inside, Rm'Twr catches Captain Mar-Vell by surprise and shoots him with a stun blast. He prepares to take the shuttle to return to the Skrull Empress with Marv-Vell. As the shuttle prepares to take off, Carol climbs aboard. Making her way to the cockpit, she sees the Skrull at the controls. Carol grabs his gun and shoots him. Lawson wakes up surprised to see Carol flying the shuttle and the dead Skrull floating around.</p><p><i>Present day.</i></p><p>Carol tries to talk to William at his restaurant since it's been days since they've talked. When she finally finds him, William breaks off their relationship, saying it was a dumb idea on his part and quickly departs. Little does Carol know that her PR rep, Sarah Day, has some dirt on William and forced him to break it off.</p><p>Carol visits Sarah to see why she wanted to talk to her before. Sarah was going to talk to her about the Daily Bugle photo of Carol kissing Wonder Man with the headline that they're making out while a cop lies dying. With J. Jonah Jameson in the hospital for a heart attack, they don't have anything to worry about.</p><p>Outside, Carol spots a moving van like the one that got away earlier. She follows it to another secret A.I.M. base. When the back is opened, a Skrull that \"looks like the X-Men\" comes out saying he has to find the \"Kree Man\" right now. With acute senses, he detects Carol and shoots optic blasts at her.</p><p>The Skrull tells her his name is Rl'Nnd and he is the son of Rm'Twr. He is able to teleport. Armoring up, he hits Carol from behind. Next he displays claws and tries slashing at Carol. When he notices that she smells of Kree, he says he can continue his true mission now that he has \"his scent.\" Leaving, Carol has no idea what just happened.</p><p>Flying back towards the city, Carol decides to try calling William. Since she hasn't been around Mar-Vell in days, she wonders if the scent Rm'Twr picked up could be from William. Could he be Kree? When he answers he is surprised since \"Carol\" is with him at that exact moment. This other Carol asks him who is on the phone. Her eyes begin to glow green as William begs for Carol to come quickly over the phone.</p><p>Carol busts into William's apartment and searches for him. She is shocked to find him lying dead on the bed. Before she can fully react, Agent Sum arrives pointing a large gun at her. He tells her it won't matter if she's a Skrull or not, the gun will take her down.</p>",
