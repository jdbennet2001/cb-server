            "description": "<p><i>Cable’s old protégé, Cannonball, has returned! In the future Sam Guthrie is one of the only remaining mutants and he’ll do anything in his power to save Cable and the baby. It’s Cannonball versus Bishop in a fight to the death!</i></p><p>Cable landed in the mutantless future of 2043 and once there was ambushed by the former X-Man Lucas Bishop, who tracked him through time. Bishop tried to kill the messiah child, in hopes of preventing his horrific future from becoming reality, but fell captive to a band of highwaymen. Injured, and with a malfunctioning time mechanism, Cable sought shelter with a waitress named Sophie. He learned that the highwaymen are agents of the Turnpike Authority, a brutal regime who use fear and violence to control the population. Sophie hopes Cable will help change that, but before either of them can decide on a course of action the house is rocked by a great explosion. The front door flies off its hinges and in walks Cable’s old protйgй – Cannonball.</p><p>What happened:</p><ul><li><p>As Cable and Cannonball reunite in Sophie's apartment, Bishop goes back to the fight scene and finds no dead bodies – meaning he's back on the hunt for Cable and the child. He goes to the near diner and attacks the manager, wanting answers for the whereabouts of his targets.</p></li><li><p>Sam tells Nathan that all mutants are gone but him. They were exterminated in less than three decades; Cable's mission has failed. Meanwhile, Bishop gets his answers and heads to Sophie's place.</p></li><li><p>Sam says that he used Cerebra to locate Cable. After the last telepath died the remaining mutants managed to work the device. Eventually Sam was left alone and for years watched mutants gone. Then he waited more for Cable's return, until now.</p></li><li><p>Soon after, a near explosion confirms that Bishop is coming. Cannonball decides to stay and stop Bishop while Cable, Sophie and baby escape. Bishop is surprised to see Sam and don't want to fight him. Sam doesn't share the same sentiments, still angry about Bishop's betrayal in the X-Men years ago. He attacks Bishop and looks like he has the upper hand.</p></li><li><p>Cable asks Sophie to make a stop. He desperately tries to work his time mechanism and prevent the imminent tragedy. Cannonball gives his best shot and smashes into Bishop, creating a crater. Bishop's cybernetic arm releases a tentacle and goes through Sam's chest. As he's dying, the tentacle holding his bleeding heart, Sam asks Bishop why he's doing this. \"To save you\", his killer replies and stand over the dead body of the former X-Man. Cable is saddened by his failure to go back in time and eventually decides: No more running.</p></li></ul><p>Not everyone is fond of bathing in boiled oil, so Bishop's attempts to be nice are actually taken the wrong way. At least it gets him the answers he needs.</p><p>Someone needs to be changed, and it ain't the baby.</p><p>In 2043 Sam Guthrie works in the New Jersey Public Works Dept.</p><p>Bishop invented this treatment: Give the heart 2 minutes outside once a day to prevent heart attacks. It was yet to be contradicted.</p>",

Plus, a co-feature in issue #1 explores the mysterious connection between several villains who are watching the Trinity -as well as the near future for these characters and their surrounding world! Co-features in issues #2-4 fill in back-story on some of the other important players in this major storyline. These stories are written by Busiek &amp; Fabian Nicieza with art by Scott McDaniel &amp; Andy Owens (NIGHTWING, GREEN ARROW), Tom Derenick &amp; Wayne Faucher and Mike Norton &amp; Jerry Ordway (ALL-NEW ATOM, INFINITE CRISIS).</em></p><p>\"Caped Simioid Thinks So, Hm?\" - The Justice League continue to face off against Konvikt, drawing him away from populated areas and into the country. Meanwhile, Batman takes this opportunity to follow his trail back to the craft he arrived in.</p><p>\"World-Something...\" - Marguerita is still troubled by her dreams and her tarot-readings. She even is plagued in her dreams, including one dream featuring a battle between Despero and Kanjar Ro..</p><p><b>Spoilers:</b></p><p>Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and some of the JLA continue to try to take down Konvikt and Graak. Superman recovers from Konvikt's punch last week and carries them high in the sky as he tells the others to save the city people. Graak reveals that he has some blasting power and knocks Superman back. He asks Konvikt to save them from their fall.</p><p>Morgaine and Enigma watch the events from her lair. She notes that Superman is the Savior in the Trinity while Wonder Woman gives others the Inspiration to do things. She wonders if Batman's role is to \"scare the Hell out of people.\" Enigma laughs and says there is a lot more to Batman than she's seen. She then sees that Batman is running off while the heroes are still trying to stop Konvikt.</p><p>Out in the country Wonder Woman sees that Konvikt's body has transformed slightly and he appears to have gotten stronger. From behind her, what appears to be a blue-furred arm reaches out and presses a red globe against her shoulder blade. It burns and leaves a mark. Before she can fully react, Konvikt is on top of her. Superman arrives to join in the battle as they try to give Batman more time.</p><p>Batman has back-tracked Konvikt to his ship. He contacts Superman and says it appears to be an escape pod. He'll let him know if there's anything else there. In the shadows, Graak is waiting to blast Batman from behind.</p><p>In the <em>back-up story</em>...Tarot cannot resist the temptation of reading her own cards to see what the recent events meant. The first reveals she may have a connection to a higher power. The second says she has to use her powers for the world. The third card is Death. The death card usually means the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. She feels the power of the cards drawing her in. She doesn't understand how it's happening and after seeing a vision of the universe, she decides she needs sleep.</p><p>Tarot dreams of Despero attacking a world. He soon comes face to face with Kanjar Ro. They fight and Kanjar Ro soon takes off. He wonders why Despero is interested in an interspatial gateway. In her sleep, Tarot mumbles that Despero doesn't know why, he simply dreamed it and is drawn to it. Before she can see what lies on the other side of the gateway, she is woken up by her phone. It is Jose calling to say that he has not been able to find any information on the \"Three Who Shall Rise\" gang. He is worried though because the M.V.G. gang members that were killed (when chasing Tarot) had dealings with an older, more powerful gang. Picking up his Gangbuster helmut, he tells her that he's hoping things don't get worse for her with the gangs.</p>",

As this never-before-seen chapter of Spidey’s life unfolds, witness the trials and tribulations of young Peter confronting fame, money and everything he ever dreamed of! With a healthy dose of that ol’ Parker luck, of course…</em></p><p>The city is under attack from a creature that looks like it stepped out of a movie staring monsters in rubber suits. Even though the Fantastic Four have shown up to fight this monstrosity, the situation is still grave. With his spider-sense to warn him, Peter moves through the crowd of panicking people to get uncle Ben and Liz to safety. Among all the chaos, Peter comes across a homeless man trapped under rubble. The Thing steps in and gives Peter a hand and tells him that he's got more spine than all the thugs on Yancy Street combined. Unfortunately, the homeless man still dies, despite being saved, which weighs heavily on Peter's conscience. Thing tries to console Peter but he runs away.</p><p>During the long drive home, uncle Ben tries to comfort Peter, telling him that it was the Fantastic Four's job to handle the situation because they have powers. Uncle Ben says the famous line \"With great power there must also come great responsibility.\" He says he's proud of his nephew for trying to help even though he has no powers, making Peter feel even worse.</p><p>Still feeling down, Peter goes to a club with Tiffany as Spider-Man, has a few drinks and ends up puking his guts out in the toilet. Peter tells Tiffany that he was there when that monster attacked, how he tried to save a man but he still died. She says that it wasn't his responsibility. Peter passes out and she takes a peek under his mask.</p><p>Peter wakes up and see J. Jonah Jameson ranting about how Spider-Man acts irresponsibly while the city is in danger. It is then decided by Monty's higher ups that Spider-Man has to become a hero.</p>",

All this and more await readers in the beginning of a hard-hitting new noir tale “Bad Night” Part 1 of 4, as CRIMINAL’s new expanded format keeps the hits coming! Five years ago, Jake was a happy family man, long-retired from the life of crime he grew up in, and then the police made him the prime suspect in a horrible crime and ripped his life apart. Now, years later, Jake is less than a shadow of his former self, a hopeless insomniac who walks the city streets at night. But one night, he walks into the wrong place at the right time, and his whole life changes again… For the better or the worse, is the question. And on top of this longer-than-usual length main story, CRIMINAL now features an expanded back-pages section, as well – with articles by Brubaker and other top crime writers, from novelists to screenwriters to comic writers. These noir articles have become a popular piece of the CRIMINAL package, and are something that can only be found in the comics, not in any collections. So don’t miss out on the start of a new story arc in the most acclaimed crime comic on the stands!</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i>:</p><p>It's one month after the Anti-Life Equation was released worldwide. Millions now toil as slaves of Darkseid, while the Justifier shock troops of Apokolips lay waste to the planet Earth and hunt down its protectors.</p><p>The remaining free humans and superheroes are stationed around the world, besieged within the walls of ten very familiar 'Watchtowers', as they fight a desperate, losing battle against the triumphant forces of evil.</p><p>While Green Arrow and Black Canary attempt to deliver the secret of humanity's last hope across America's blasted wastelands, the Outsiders brave the horrors of the Bludhaven bunker in search of Batman. The ultimate battle is coming…but which heroes will become villain – and vice versa? And what part do the Secret Society have to play in the dawning of this new Age of Evil?</p><p>Darkness is falling and death rules the day. Is this truly the end of the Age of Super Heroes?</p><p>The Ray narrates how the Anti-Life Equation has infected most people on Earth and how the Darkseid's forces have taken over very easily. The Ray arrives at the Hall of Justice to give information to survivors of Anti-Life the group includes Green Arrow, The Tattooed Man (with some sort of symbol Black Lightning told him about), Black Canary, Oracle, Jai and Iris West, Wally West's wife Linda and Jay Garrick's wife Joan.</p><p>The first wave of the Bludhaven have been defeated. Dan Turpin is resisting the control of Darkseid in Command-D station. His followers Simyan Mokkari and Godfrey cannot properly reside in human bodies and argue who Darkseid will save. It is revealed that Kalibak is in the body of a humanoid tiger that has been created for him.</p><p>In the Watchtower the survivors show their doubt of fighting Darkseid but Ray tells them of some hope they have because a informant in Libra's Secret Society has given them information of a internet that only villains use called the Unternet which is now being used by Checkmate and all other forms of the Resistance to Darkseid to coordinate their attacks.</p><p>Mister Terrific and Alan Scott use the Unternet to lead the Resistance who have made \"Watchtowers\" all over the globe. Amanda Waller has now come in contact with Renee Montoya who is told she plays a big part of a plan to save Earth. Black Adam is convinced by Captain Marvel to join The Resistance. Alan Scott tells the other heroes that as many of them must converge at Bludhave at dawn to fight Darkseid.</p><p>At the Hall of Justice The Tattooed Man rearranges his tattoos and shows the symbol Black Lighting told him of and resembles Metron. Black Lighting himself breaks the defense of the Hall.</p><p>Wally West and Barry Allen briefly enjoy their reunion as Barry tells Wally he is not sure how he was brought back to life. The two then battle the new Female Furies in the form of a Anti-Life infected Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Batwoman and Giganta. Wally and Barry then escape to find their families.</p><p>In the Hall of Justice Green Arrow rushes the others to the Watchtower teleporters but chooses to stay behind and remove the teleporters location codes so they cannot be tracked to outer space. Black Canary attempts to give him a kiss goodbye but is interrupted by a Anti-Life infected Black Lightning with other Justifiers. Green Arrow tries to fight back but is infected with Anti-Life via Justifier helmet. Aboard the outer space Watchtower briefly reflects on Green Arrow's sacrifice and then tells the other to search for weapons.</p><p>As The Resistance continue to battle their own who are infected with Anti-Life, Hawkgirl notices that the sky is raining Blood. In the Command-D facility Mary Marvel puts a helmet on Dan Turpin's head and Darkseid's followers taunt Dan Turpin to become the new body for Darkseid but Turpin still resists.</p><p>Iris Allen West walks home infected by Anti-Life but is surprised to see Barry and Wally. Barry then kisses Iris and has somehow removed the Anti-Life Equation's influence. The reunited couple then tearfully embrace.</p><p>At the Checkmate castle in Switzerland a boomtube opens up with Shilo Norman, Sonny Sumo and The Super Young Team all with Mr. Miracle's \"M\" symbol on their faces. Shilo attempts to get the attention of Checkmate and talk to them but is shot in the chest.</p><p>As Shilo Norman is shot Dan Turpin gives in and becomes Darkseid.</p>",

            "description": "<p>(Los Angeles, sun set)</p><p>As Victor runs through the house, Nico follows him, wondering what she did wrong with her spell. Victor feels that it's the only explanation - Nico wasn't affected because it was her spell, and he was affected because he was alreadyscattered, on account of Lillie. The two rush to Karolina Dean's room to where they inform her of their discover, but Karolina reluctantly follows them back downstairs.</p><p>When Nico points out she isn't sure how to get rid of the side-effect, Victor thinks that they are only in a reflection of the main spell; if they break the illusion, they may break the spell. While Karolina guards the suspicious-looking vaDanti, Victor runs off to grab Molly and Klara while Nico calls Chase and Xavin.</p><p>Nico calls Chase's workplace, where he is at KZIT shining Val's boots. Nico informs him to return home, seeing as he's under her spell. Chase stubbornly refuses to return home, and hangs up. A furious Nico slams her fist against a table, causing her fist to bleed. Instantly, her new Staff of One emerges. Nico suggests she may as well use it. Nico points the Staff out at the beach, to where Xavin is still at the beach party. Calling <b>\"Xavin! Here! Now!\"</b>, Xavin is magically pulled towards Nico, frightening the neighbours. As she flails through the air, she turns into her Thing-like form, crashing into the house's balcony. Xavin, grumbling, enters the house behind Nico and Karolina.</p><p>(Malibu, sun set)</p><p>Victor hurries along the beaches of Malibu to find Molly and Klara - as daylight is fading, he calls out for them. He notices the fort they've made, and laughs. Even as he laughs, the grass and plants around him rise up around his body, keeping him hostage. Knowing who the culprit is, he tells Klara to cut it out, and the two young girls reveal their hiding places in the undergrowth. They have plants on their heads to aid their disguise.</p><p>Molly is proud of her trap - she snaps her fingers, and Klara automatically calls for the plants to lie down. Molly informs Victor this is just a drill, but he gets the idea. Victor mocks them, but Molly tells him not to underestimate \"Princess Powerful and her trusty sidekick, Tower of Flower.\" Old Lace is in the bushes, as a back up to Molly and Klara's plan. Victor drags the girls and Old Lace back to the house, where Klara tells Molly she wouldn't want to be called \"Tower of Flower\", but \"Rose Red\". As they get back to the house, Molly suggests \"Rose Wild\", \"Rose Wildweed\", \"Roses Gone Wild\"... but the topic is dropped the second they see what is in their living room.</p><p>The gluttonous thing that spilled out of vaDanti's wrist glove from the previous issue takes on the form of a large, gluttonous bubble - encased in the middle of the bubble, however, are Nico, Xavin and Karolina. It is at this point where Klara notes that vaDanti had escaped.</p><p>Victor's electricity proves to be useless on the bubble. Molly, however decides to punch the bubble - this idea goes wrong, as Molly is sucked into the bubble with the others; Klara, who had attempted to stop Molly lands in the bubble as well. Victor remains to be the only Runaway (besides Chase at work) who isn't in the bubble. As Xavin, Karolina, Nico, Molly and Klara stare at Victor from the bubble, Victor takes a large spear and attempts to stab the bubble, which drags him into it as well. The others angrily lose their temper with Victor.</p><p>Molly attempts to punch her way out, but Nico and Karolina hold her back - they can't just start bashing around, as someone will get hurt. Xavin explains that the bubble is too flexible for force, but Molly doesn't believe her and punches it again. This time, the bubble expands and contracts quickly, but Molly's punch does the trick. The bubble explodes in a swirl of gloopy Majesdanian colours, covering them all with slimy gloop.</p><p>As they recover, Victor mentions the only thing he does like about Majesdane so far is Karolina. Karolina, Xavin, Molly and Klara attempt to leave for the shower, but Nico holds them back and reveals to them what her spell had did - they were scattered to a point where they wouldn't work together long enough to escape a bubble. What made them a team flew right out the window.</p><p>Nico continues by asking if they can feel it, inside - a total disconnect from the others, the desire to do their own thing no matter what anyone says. An anguished Nico reminds them the Majesdanians are coming back to take Karolina away from them, and there is no way they can stop them if they can't even beat a bubble. She asks to look around and ask if they look like a team of super heroes. Xavin admits that it's not their finest moment. \"We look like losers,\" adds a depressed Molly. Karolina agrees as well; she doesn't feels disconnected from everyone... even Xavin.</p><p>The Runaways ask if Nico can reverse the spell, but Nico fears that by using a spell to undo the scatter effect, she may get more side-effects. Xavin suggests she practice on Chase (who is at work), but Victor brings up his suggestion. Victor explains that he's been thinking about it, and doesn't feel that they're under the full power of the spell - just a weaker reflection of it, since they were in the room when Nico cast it. He thinks that they can break the spell's effect if they just concentrate on something that needs total cooperation with each other.</p><p>Nico agrees that the plan makes sense, but before they can act, Karolina spots something outside... the Runaways move out on to the balcony as something drops from the clouds. Victor hopes that it's just a weather balloon, but Xavin points out that weather balloons don't leave vapor trails... the Majesdanian's have returned, but the Runaways aren't even ready at all.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>In this issue, Xavin wears a Bryant 24 vest in this issue. Kobe Bryant is (at the time of writing) a basketball player for the L.A. Lakers.</p><p>Victor also references Lillie, the girl he fell in love with in 1907. Victor was already \"scattered\" because Lillie had changed her mind about coming to the present, breaking Victor's heart. Lillie spent the rest of her life in regret. This took place in issue #30 (June 2008).</p>",

A new evil is unleashed on the world...one with some all-too-familiar qualities...one that even the combined might of Spidey and the X-Men may not be able to fight! If you wondered how this mini-series would affect the present-day Marvel Universe, wonder no more, true believer! (Oh, and that Alberti guy, the one whose art has been knocking everyone's socks off? He's still here too.)</i></p><p>A couple Morlocks are on the run. The survivor makes his way to Xavier's and tells the X-Men that it was Kraven the Hunter. Cyclops asks Wolverine to contact Spider-Man since Kraven is more his expertise.</p><p>At the scene, Spider-Man arrives and assures the X-Men that Kraven is as dead as can be. He suggests going back to their place and using their 'super-mega-x-computer' to look up all his wacky relatives. There Spider-Man discovers that all are accounted for. No relatives are in the area. He then recalls their fight against Kraven and Mr. Sinister and things begin to fit together.</p><p>At that same moment, the power to the mansion is shut off. They find themselves against what looks like a cross between Kraven and Sinister. He simply refers to himself as \"The Hunter.\" He manages to keep the X-Men and Spider-Man down when Spidey asks him if he's just another clone. This causes the Hunter to think back to his creation. Sinister created him to hunt down mutants and collect their DNA. He refuses to give him an identity until after his mission is over.</p><p>WIth the thought of no identity, the Hunter calls himself \"Xraven.\" He steps things up by showing that he has the powers of the original X-Men. When things begin to look bad, Cyclops convinces Xraven that Sinister is only using him as a puppet. He tells Xraven to look into his mind at how he, himself, had been manipulated since he was a kid.</p><p>Xraven leaves in a fit of anger. He decides to return to Sinister and have some words with him...actually more than just words.</p>",

Already a nightmare, things take a turn for the horrifying worst as Cindy's party encounters their deepest fear, a group of Crossed that are hunting them. Tired, hungry, and low on all supplies, now they face a clever bunch of the most evil S.O.Bs you can imagine. Nothing is going right, but this is no fairy tale - there are no magic cures on the horizon. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed!

A major new series by Warren Ellis, the writer who reinvented science fiction in comics -- a retro-punk \"future of the past\" where spaceships still belched smoke and arguments were still settled with laser pistols. Mary Raven has to die. Today might be Mary Raven's last day on Earth, trapped on the last spaceport where no-one cares about murder and the only real currency is fear. She has her dead father's raygun, and that's enough for space hero turned arms dealer Lightning Bowman to want her dead. But she also has her dead father's diary. And now she knows something no-one else in the settlement does...and they'll want her dead for that, too... Ignition City is an on-going color epic told in five issue series featuring the art of Aetheric Mechanics' Gianluca Pagliarani and launching with a Regular and Wraparound cover by Pagliarani, a painted cover by Felipe Massafera and a rare Design Sketch cover by Pagliarani!</i>",

They ID him as a cop and tell him they are clearing the roads into the city and he should get indoors.</p><p>fearing for their lives the uniformed officers decide to hand over the pair to the mob, much to the new commander's anger. As she races outside to stop the handover both the DHE and the ghost-bomb arrive. Alice is worried when Peter tells her the drones are clearing the roads, its not how they deal with riots.. but it is if they need heavy weapons to deal with the ghostbomb.</p><p>Dr Love has worked out that Mailk has been using the blue-light to transmit a signal that enrages people and caused all the trouble they have been seeing. Malik was killed during Enhanced Questioning where police tortured him and buried him as a guilty man. Now he wants revenge for 30 years being buried with the worst in society.</p><p>the drones take out the DHE craft that suppressing communications and Hotwire downloads the schematics and manuals for the equipment used to make the tentacled body of Malik and wirelessly hacks his physical boy using default passwords. She explained before how all devices interconnect and self test and secure each other, but since his equipment was top-secret they excluded that from him but ironically left the very back-doors that cloud of safety prevents. This stops his physical form from attacking but his control fo the blue light is still in full effect. She jams a suppressor spike into him and is shrouded in flames, Peter races to her aid as Malik begs her not to do this and not to hurt herself. Peter jumps in an pulls her away, her arm on fire and her face burnt down the right side but Malik is finally put to rest. Elsewhere there is just two bloody marks where the bad cops were standing.</p>",

All this and Power Girl has to figure out how to pay the mounting Starrware bills as well!?! <br/>    <p>The book opens with Terra and Power Girl sitting in a movie theater watching previews. After a couple of stupid trailers and one poorly executed pass by some random guy their movie begins. We find that Terra is no real fan of horror films.</p> <p>As they are enjoying the movie a monster comes to shore Godzilla style. I mean Mathew Broderick Godzilla style. Right out of the water and over the bus, all we see are the feet. The two women come out of the theater and hear the commotion.</p> <p>Ready to battle Power Girl begins to get out of her street clothes, only to find out that Terra did not wear her costume under her street clothes. Not to worry, or be out done Terra strips down to her underwear, and off to battle she goes.</p> <p>When they get to the Brooklyn Bridge they see a blonde on an Ogre. She calls herself Zoraida, and she has come to liberate the city for the plants and animals, and return the city to the green. Of course Power Girl is having none of it and rushes in to shut her down.</p> <p>It does not take long for Power Girl to realize that the book her young blonde adversary is using is the source of her power. So Power Girl simply takes the book and slaps her. Even with a last ditch use of Manga monsters, the young environmentalist has no chance of winning.</p> <p>Instead of having the young lady arrested she admires her enthusiasm for helping the planet, and offers her a job. At the end of the book we see Kara touring her companies R &amp; D section and seeing where possible cash flow can come from. She needs an apartment soon, and as she is apartment hunting while she is touring a seemingly perfect place, her and her real estate agent see something fall out of the sky near by, thus setting up issue # 5.    </p>",

            "description": "<p>BASIC PLOT:</p><p><i><em>In the conclusion to Chun-li’s prequel miniseries, the strongest woman in the world comes face to face with the King of Muay Thai! It’s Chun-li VS Sagat, with the souls of eight thousand Chinese warriors on the line!</em></i></p><p>DETAILED SYNOPSIS:</p><p>Two guards approach the Hong Kong Royal Museum, apparently there to relieve the two guards already on duty. The on-duty guards don't recognize the newcomers, and one of them apologetically goes to make a phone call and confirm things when the two new guards suddenly lash out, knocking out the other two men with stun guns. They reveal themselves to be Shadaloo agents when they contact Sagat, telling him the entrance is now secure.</p><p>Sagat says not to disturb him unless something suspicious occurs then, turns his attention to the Terracotta statues. Staring into the eye of one of the statues, Sagat seems to lose himself for a moment, until a thug asks him what's wrong. Sagat snaps out of it and says that its nothing, and for the men to load the statues onto the truck. \"We have a job to do.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, back at the restaurant from last issue, Chun Li, Po lIn and Dorai scatter as a spray of bullets tear through the place. Po Lin makes her way to the front door and identifies at least four shooters in the second floor of the building across the street.</p><p>Po Lin asks Dorai and Chun Li to cover her while she makes a break for the back exit. Dorai says it's too dangerous - that he'll go, but she says that he is old and slow and that the discussion is over.</p><p>Across the way, Gen takes out all the snipers, and asks them what their interest is in Dorai and Chun Li.</p><p>Just as Dorai is wondering why the shooting has stopped,his phone rings.Its one of the shooters, who says that he was ordered by Sagat to take them out before they could tell anyone about the museum heist. He says that Sagat should be loading the Terracotta statues onto a boat right then, from where they will be transferred to a submarine once offshore. He tells Dorai that Sagat believes they are all dead, because that is what he reported. Dorai asks why, and the man replies \"Because someone told me to,\" as Gen stands over him. Gen tells the man to wait there for the authorities if he wants to live, but the man comes at him the minute his back is turned, and with a \"ZANAI\" attack, Gen regretfully kills the man.</p><p>Escaping from the restaurant, Dorai, Chun Li and Po Lin discover that the boat with the statues is already gone, and Dorai plots to intercept it. Deciding that one stealth is better then strength, he chooses to send only one boat with himself, Chun Li and Po Lin.</p><p>The three of them get the jump on Sagat and his men as they are about to move the statues over to the Shadaloo submarine, but one of the Shadaloo toughs opens fire and a brief gunfight erupts until both sides realize the statues are too valuable to risk harming. Instead Sagat's men engage the three police officials in melee combat. Chun Li and Dorai take them all out, but Po Lin is thrown overboard when she lets her anger overwhelm her judgment. Dorai and Chun Li then engages Sagat, who is beating them both pretty soundly until Dorai lands a \"KIKOSHO\" fireball attack on the Muy Thai fighter.</p><p>Before the fight can continue, Po Lin returns to the scene and holds Sagat at gunpoint. She suggests simply killing him to Chun Li and Dorai, who make it clear that doing so would be wrong, but before Po Lin can do anything Sagat suddenly lashes out. He knocks the gun from Po Lin's hands and follows up with a brutal kick that snaps the girl's leg. Seeing Police Helicopters heading towards him, Sagat jumps onto the still waiting submarine to escape, ordering it to submerge as he does so.</p><p>As Dorai calls for medical assistance for Po Lin, the injured girl apologizes to Chun Li, and says that she was right, apparently referring to her reaction to Po Lin's desire to shoot Sagat in the back of the head.</p><p>On the sub, Sagat remarks that Bison will have to make due with the six statues they managed to load on board. When he touches one, however, he suddenly receives a vision from the future. He sees a fighter, his face hidden in shadows, unleashing a brutal uppercut to his midsection, defeating him and leaving a permenant scar. The visions convince Sagat that Bison should never possess the statues, and the power they possess, so he destroys them and reports his failure to Bison. He says that none of the statues were retrieved due to Dorai's interference. Frowning, Bison states his resolve to do something about Dorai soon.</p><p>Later, Chun Li visits Po Lin in the hospital, where Po Lin tells her that she will be resigning from the force because she can't let revenge be the primary thing guiding her through life. Chun Li says she understands, and later Dorai and Chun Li accompany Po Lin when she visits her parents graves and tells them that she now realizes that the best way she can honor them is by lving her own life as they had wanted her to.</p><p>As they walk away, Chun Li asks her father if he thinks she would make the same decisions that Po Lin had if Chun Li had lost him. He replies that he trusts her to always do the right thing, and we see that the two of them are being spied on by Shadaloo Agent Killer Bee, apparently moments before she abducts Dorai.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Issue #4 starts of in Gotham, before Tim left.  He's in the Red Robin suit, heading towards Gotham Airport.  He stops to look back at Gotham asking what is he doing?  Dick shows up in the Bat Suit telling him they need to talk.   <br/>In Baghdad Tim see's the three Assassins, wondering why they're there.  Then realizing that giving Ra's orders probably wouldn't have worked.  As he reached for the throwing discs, deciding that this is going to have to be public, he gets surrounded by Military Police.  Tim thinks his short career as Red Robin is over.  They believe Tim to be his Alias, Alvin Draper, and intend to bring him in for questioning.  Tim traveled too quickly after Berlin and it appears to German Government are on to him.  \"Z\" shows up, appearing to be a Wayne Enterprises employee, telling the Sergeant that there has been a mistake.  He tells them he is Tim's bodyguard, saying this is Tim Drake.  Tim explains to the Sergeant that he is here to see the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne, his adoptive father.  Once everything checks out Tim turns to the assassins who tell him they are here whether he likes it or not.  Back in Berlin, Tam Fox seems to be tracing Tim's tracks.  In Baghdad Tim feels like he's on Bizzaro world and Ra's is his new Alfred, Butler of the Damned.  Ra's again tries to get Tim to tell him why he thinks Bruce is alive.  For the first time we see what Tim got from Germany.  It appears to be part of a wall, with a boomerang/batarang on it.  \"Z\" knocks on his door telling him they should prepare.  Tim tries to brush him off, but he tells him how he's been studying him for weeks and that he usually isn't as arrogant as he is being.  Telling him to keep his emotions in check, he reminds him this isn't Gotham, telling him of the dangers of the area.  Tim asks why he is helping him and we learn that they fought together, back when they resurrected Ra's.  He tells him he fought to bring him back just as Tim is trying to bring back his \"father\" now.  \"Z\" tells him he knows how he feels now, lost.  He says his mission is a unique one, different from killing someone, this time he gets to restore a life; Tim's   <br/> <br/>Tim begins to question how far he is willing to go.  He doesn't see the line anymore.  As Robin he never crossed that line, nor did Batman.  It seems that all Tim is doing now is compromising.  He hopes it's worth it.  Back in Gotham before, Dick approaches Tim telling him he wants to believe Bruce is alive but after everything they've gone through before the Crisis, it was like Bruce knew this was going to be it.  He says we're not like the others, Gods or Aliens.  Bruce was a man, and they buried him.  Dick wants to help him, but Tim says no and tells Dick to let go of him.  Tim throws Dick over his shoulder.  Back in Baghdad Tim and the Assassins are in a jeep, Owens is telling a story about Pru and the White Ghost's first meeting.  He broke 11 of her bones, to which Tim quickly says that breaking her nose 3 times isn't anything new to her.  The two males laugh at the joke.  Tim goes back to thinking about how Ra's calls Bruce \"Detective.\"  He remembers how he knew that Dick Grayson was Robin and Bruce Wayne was Batman.  He then says he had the same type of moment recently.  He knows Bruce is alive, and even though the evidence is insane and the trail is cold, he knows Bruce is alive.  Upon entering a cave he sees a Bat Symbol drawn on the wall telling Tim, Bruce is lost and the trail begins here.   <br/> <br/>Back in Gotham Tim confronts Dick saying that he knows how it sounds, and asks him if he thinks he doesn't know that.  He knows that it sounds like he's snapped, but he's going to prove it because he knows he's right.  Dick tries to tell him about a therapist in Metropolis but Tim tells him they're done here.  He tells him he's leaving and Dick has to let him.  He explains that if he meant what he said about them being partners and if he really meant it, if he really is his brother then he should have earned Dick's belief in him.  Tim tells Dick to take care of Gotham and not let Damian destroy everything they built as Robin.  If there is even a chance of Bruce being out there he has to try.  Dick watches as Tim leaves, not saying a word.   <br/> <br/>Back in Baghdad, Tim realizes he was looking at the wall for an hour, he exits the cave to find the 3 assassins still there.  \"Z\" asks him how he feels.  Tim's response is a smile, Pru jokes about getting a bonus because of this.  However, there is a noise and \"Z\" is stabbed through chest.  The Widower calls out the remaining Assassins asking for them to put up a fight.  He slices Pru and Owens and heads towards Tim saying he wasn't on the list but stabs Tim anyway.  He tells Tim the council of Spiders appreciates their participation in the game.  Tim's mind starts to race, saying how he knew he was right, and that the compromises were going to end.  He would find himself again.  He feels the blood rushing out of his body he says soon he'll be dead like \"Z\" and Owens.  He see's Pru bleeding out and again he says he knew he was right.  He thought he would die as Robin.  Ra's asks Tim if he found what he was looking for.  When there is no response he calls out \"Timothy?\"</p>",

Not only does a crack squad of Hydra shock troops want to put the smackdown on our boy Deadpool, but the cavemen want back their god (i.e. the severed-but-still annoying head of the Marvel Zombies Deadpool) and have turned out the troops, spears ready to fly. Even with Ka-Zar’s help, it’s going to be a close one. To make matters worse, “Severed Headpool” can’t keep his teeth to himself. One hungry bite can bring a world of hurt down on top of Deadpool and the luscious Dr. Betty.</i></p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage and a parody of the movie poster for <em><a href=\"/scarface/4025-239/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-239\">Scarface</a></em>.</li></ul>",

Make way for the demented return of Scarecrow and Madcap to the Ghost Rider rogues gallery. Better buy two copies of this issue because you're bound to wet one with your tears of terror.</i></p><p>In the small town of Jaspercounty, two officers start the day.

Meanwhile in the cells, Scarecrow and Madcap are in the cell surrounded by dead bodies.</p><p>Hours later Sara, Hellstorm, Jaine, and Anton arrive in the town to hide him only to find the satanic church in which they were going to gone. It is then told by Jaine that Zadkiel moved it and that the longer he stays in Heaven to more he can change anything on Earth.</p><p>The team ends up in Jaspercounty. Jaine enters a grocery store to get a beer and is encountered by Madcap.</p><p>Meanwhile Hellstorm enters an abandoned fair and finds Scarecrow with two victims.</p><p>Sara and anton are then chased by the towns people who have been turned into maniacs.

You know the situation Dick Cheney likes to talk about--the one where you have a criminal in custody, there's imminent danger to innocent lives, and only your captive has the information needed to save them? John Dusk is in that situation now. Except the perp isn't in John's custody, he's in the NYPD's. And they don't torture. If John takes matters into his own hands, with everyone watching...everything changes. He's always told himself he brutalized criminals to save innocents. But will he NOT torture and kill to save himself, even if it means others die? John always knew there would come a time when he had to choose between his two lives. That time is now. And either way, there's no going back. He wants to be forgiven...but he doesn't want to stop.

Howard's original tales-along with other Conan adventures-and working with such esteemed artists as John Buscema, Sal Buscema, Ernie Colon, Klaus Janson, and the amazing Gil Kane! The Savage Sword of Conan brought the world thrilling adaptations of \"Sons of the White Wolf,\" \"The Legions of the Dead,\" and \"The Treasure of Tranicos.\" The real treasure in this massive tome, however, is the sprawling, ambitious adaptation of the Conan the Buccaneer novel by the powerhouse team of Roy Thomas, John Buscema, and Tony DeZuniga!

However, Masato approaches the situation with aplomb and comes up with new ways to pave the way for Hikaru and those like him to become “cheerful working adults”…with surprising results. Hikaru himself seems to be getting closer, bit by bit, to achieving this goal as the Azumas decide to foster their son’s independence in a variety of ways, including getting to and from school on his own. But when Hikaru encounters an old acquaintance on the way home and leads Sachiko to a horrific discovery, will the Azumas be able to return a favor and help out a friend in need?</i></p><p>Collects and translates volumes 7 &amp; 8 of Hikari To Tomoni.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Later Elementary Years</h4><ul><li>Episode 25</li><li>Episode 26</li><li>Episode 27</li><li>Episode 28</li><li>Episode 29</li><li>Episode 30</li><li>Episode 31</li><li>Episode 32</li><li>Episode 33</li><li>Episode 34</li><li>Episode 35</li><li>Episode 36</li></ul><h4>The Future Of Autistic Children Becoming Adults by Toshikazu Shiga</h4><h4>Autistic People Will Work ~In Our Case~ by Yasuaki Matsui</h4><h4>Act to Support Persons With Developmental Disabilities</h4>",

Claudia, who pays more attention to her art than her grades, feels she can't compete with her perfect sister. Janine studies nonstop, makes straight As, and even takes college-level courses.

            "description": "<p><em>Mark Schultz’s Various Drawings series returns with this fourth dazzling collection. His best work over the last two years features continued experimentation with graphite, charcoal, brush and ink, and color-tinted images exemplifying his continued growth as an artist.</em></p><p><em>Highlighting this compilation is Schultz’s new Pulpette personal works. These four plates combine Mark’s love for pulp magazine imagery combined with classic pin-up style art. Development sketches showcase his stages of production.</em></p><p><em>Also included are preliminary pieces and a self-rejected sample for his upcoming illustrated novella, Storms at Sea as well as new Xenozoic Tales specialty drawings. Additional illustrations include recent commissions, spotlighted by an evocative Helen of Troy nude. Completing this volume is a Martian fantasy gatefold, sketchbook experimentations, and Schultz’s contribution to Prince Valiant.</em></p><p><em>Over fifty illustrations are featured in this volume—the majority not publicly shown until now. The hardbound edition is limited to 800 copies. Exclusive to this edition is a bound in plate reproducing an unpublished illustration. Each copy is numbered and signed.</em></p>",
