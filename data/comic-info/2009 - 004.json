A new evil is unleashed on the world...one with some all-too-familiar qualities...one that even the combined might of Spidey and the X-Men may not be able to fight! If you wondered how this mini-series would affect the present-day Marvel Universe, wonder no more, true believer! (Oh, and that Alberti guy, the one whose art has been knocking everyone's socks off? He's still here too.)</i></p><p>A couple Morlocks are on the run. The survivor makes his way to Xavier's and tells the X-Men that it was Kraven the Hunter. Cyclops asks Wolverine to contact Spider-Man since Kraven is more his expertise.</p><p>At the scene, Spider-Man arrives and assures the X-Men that Kraven is as dead as can be. He suggests going back to their place and using their 'super-mega-x-computer' to look up all his wacky relatives. There Spider-Man discovers that all are accounted for. No relatives are in the area. He then recalls their fight against Kraven and Mr. Sinister and things begin to fit together.</p><p>At that same moment, the power to the mansion is shut off. They find themselves against what looks like a cross between Kraven and Sinister. He simply refers to himself as \"The Hunter.\" He manages to keep the X-Men and Spider-Man down when Spidey asks him if he's just another clone. This causes the Hunter to think back to his creation. Sinister created him to hunt down mutants and collect their DNA. He refuses to give him an identity until after his mission is over.</p><p>WIth the thought of no identity, the Hunter calls himself \"Xraven.\" He steps things up by showing that he has the powers of the original X-Men. When things begin to look bad, Cyclops convinces Xraven that Sinister is only using him as a puppet. He tells Xraven to look into his mind at how he, himself, had been manipulated since he was a kid.</p><p>Xraven leaves in a fit of anger. He decides to return to Sinister and have some words with him...actually more than just words.</p>",

            "description": "<i>Where did the space heroes go to die? A major new series by Warren Ellis, the writer who reinvented science fiction in comics -- a retro-punk \"future of the past\" where spaceships still belched smoke and arguments were still settled with laser pistols. Mary Raven has to die. Today might be Mary Raven's last day on Earth, trapped on the last spaceport where no-one cares about murder and the only real currency is fear. She has her dead father's raygun, and that's enough for space hero turned arms dealer Lightning Bowman to want her dead. But she also has her dead father's diary. And now she knows something no-one else in the settlement does...and they'll want her dead for that, too... Ignition City is an on-going color epic told in five issue series featuring the art of Aetheric Mechanics' Gianluca Pagliarani and launching with a Regular and Wraparound cover by Pagliarani, a painted cover by Felipe Massafera and a rare Design Sketch cover by Pagliarani!</i>",

If you're Alice Hotwire, you risk everything to face the horror of Amir Malik and uncover a truth that could both save the city - and destroy it at the same time.</i></p><p>The riots are coming to a head and Alice appears drowned in the facility.</p><p>An unconscious Alice dreams of her parents and the technological upbringing she had. Her mother was a beautiful scientist and her dad a software genius who would make video blogs ranting about the society which ultimately leads to government agency raiding their facility calling them terrorists. Alice and her mother were playing a video game with handheld light guns and when the armed counter-terrorist team enter they mistake it for a real gun and kill her mother.</p><p>She wakes live and before the skull and ribcage being again. It is Malik the innocent man buried as a murderer. He used his power to get into Glenn's mind and he was given 10 times as much attention and work as the others they worked on. He used tentacles to save Alice from the flood waters and now he is going to the police HQ. He floats out of the facility and Alice scrambles for the transporter to take her back there too. She called Peter and directs him there as well, his car gets snarled up in rioting yobs who recognize him a s cop. before they can do him any harm a homeland enforcement drone arrives over his car and opens fire without warning smashing the mob into a fiery pulp. They ID him as a cop and tell him they are clearing the roads into the city and he should get indoors.</p><p>fearing for their lives the uniformed officers decide to hand over the pair to the mob, much to the new commander's anger. As she races outside to stop the handover both the DHE and the ghost-bomb arrive. Alice is worried when Peter tells her the drones are clearing the roads, its not how they deal with riots.. but it is if they need heavy weapons to deal with the ghostbomb.</p><p>Dr Love has worked out that Mailk has been using the blue-light to transmit a signal that enrages people and caused all the trouble they have been seeing. Malik was killed during Enhanced Questioning where police tortured him and buried him as a guilty man. Now he wants revenge for 30 years being buried with the worst in society.</p><p>the drones take out the DHE craft that suppressing communications and Hotwire downloads the schematics and manuals for the equipment used to make the tentacled body of Malik and wirelessly hacks his physical boy using default passwords. She explained before how all devices interconnect and self test and secure each other, but since his equipment was top-secret they excluded that from him but ironically left the very back-doors that cloud of safety prevents. This stops his physical form from attacking but his control fo the blue light is still in full effect. She jams a suppressor spike into him and is shrouded in flames, Peter races to her aid as Malik begs her not to do this and not to hurt herself. Peter jumps in an pulls her away, her arm on fire and her face burnt down the right side but Malik is finally put to rest. Elsewhere there is just two bloody marks where the bad cops were standing.</p>",

All this and Power Girl has to figure out how to pay the mounting Starrware bills as well!?! <br/>    <p>The book opens with Terra and Power Girl sitting in a movie theater watching previews. After a couple of stupid trailers and one poorly executed pass by some random guy their movie begins. We find that Terra is no real fan of horror films.</p> <p>As they are enjoying the movie a monster comes to shore Godzilla style. I mean Mathew Broderick Godzilla style. Right out of the water and over the bus, all we see are the feet. The two women come out of the theater and hear the commotion.</p> <p>Ready to battle Power Girl begins to get out of her street clothes, only to find out that Terra did not wear her costume under her street clothes. Not to worry, or be out done Terra strips down to her underwear, and off to battle she goes.</p> <p>When they get to the Brooklyn Bridge they see a blonde on an Ogre. She calls herself Zoraida, and she has come to liberate the city for the plants and animals, and return the city to the green. Of course Power Girl is having none of it and rushes in to shut her down.</p> <p>It does not take long for Power Girl to realize that the book her young blonde adversary is using is the source of her power. So Power Girl simply takes the book and slaps her. Even with a last ditch use of Manga monsters, the young environmentalist has no chance of winning.</p> <p>Instead of having the young lady arrested she admires her enthusiasm for helping the planet, and offers her a job. At the end of the book we see Kara touring her companies R &amp; D section and seeing where possible cash flow can come from. She needs an apartment soon, and as she is apartment hunting while she is touring a seemingly perfect place, her and her real estate agent see something fall out of the sky near by, thus setting up issue # 5.    </p>",

            "description": "<p>BASIC PLOT:</p><p><i><em>In the conclusion to Chun-li’s prequel miniseries, the strongest woman in the world comes face to face with the King of Muay Thai! It’s Chun-li VS Sagat, with the souls of eight thousand Chinese warriors on the line!</em></i></p><p>DETAILED SYNOPSIS:</p><p>Two guards approach the Hong Kong Royal Museum, apparently there to relieve the two guards already on duty. The on-duty guards don't recognize the newcomers, and one of them apologetically goes to make a phone call and confirm things when the two new guards suddenly lash out, knocking out the other two men with stun guns. They reveal themselves to be Shadaloo agents when they contact Sagat, telling him the entrance is now secure.</p><p>Sagat says not to disturb him unless something suspicious occurs then, turns his attention to the Terracotta statues. Staring into the eye of one of the statues, Sagat seems to lose himself for a moment, until a thug asks him what's wrong. Sagat snaps out of it and says that its nothing, and for the men to load the statues onto the truck. \"We have a job to do.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, back at the restaurant from last issue, Chun Li, Po lIn and Dorai scatter as a spray of bullets tear through the place. Po Lin makes her way to the front door and identifies at least four shooters in the second floor of the building across the street.</p><p>Po Lin asks Dorai and Chun Li to cover her while she makes a break for the back exit. Dorai says it's too dangerous - that he'll go, but she says that he is old and slow and that the discussion is over.</p><p>Across the way, Gen takes out all the snipers, and asks them what their interest is in Dorai and Chun Li.</p><p>Just as Dorai is wondering why the shooting has stopped,his phone rings.Its one of the shooters, who says that he was ordered by Sagat to take them out before they could tell anyone about the museum heist. He says that Sagat should be loading the Terracotta statues onto a boat right then, from where they will be transferred to a submarine once offshore. He tells Dorai that Sagat believes they are all dead, because that is what he reported. Dorai asks why, and the man replies \"Because someone told me to,\" as Gen stands over him. Gen tells the man to wait there for the authorities if he wants to live, but the man comes at him the minute his back is turned, and with a \"ZANAI\" attack, Gen regretfully kills the man.</p><p>Escaping from the restaurant, Dorai, Chun Li and Po Lin discover that the boat with the statues is already gone, and Dorai plots to intercept it. Deciding that one stealth is better then strength, he chooses to send only one boat with himself, Chun Li and Po Lin.</p><p>The three of them get the jump on Sagat and his men as they are about to move the statues over to the Shadaloo submarine, but one of the Shadaloo toughs opens fire and a brief gunfight erupts until both sides realize the statues are too valuable to risk harming. Instead Sagat's men engage the three police officials in melee combat. Chun Li and Dorai take them all out, but Po Lin is thrown overboard when she lets her anger overwhelm her judgment. Dorai and Chun Li then engages Sagat, who is beating them both pretty soundly until Dorai lands a \"KIKOSHO\" fireball attack on the Muy Thai fighter.</p><p>Before the fight can continue, Po Lin returns to the scene and holds Sagat at gunpoint. She suggests simply killing him to Chun Li and Dorai, who make it clear that doing so would be wrong, but before Po Lin can do anything Sagat suddenly lashes out. He knocks the gun from Po Lin's hands and follows up with a brutal kick that snaps the girl's leg. Seeing Police Helicopters heading towards him, Sagat jumps onto the still waiting submarine to escape, ordering it to submerge as he does so.</p><p>As Dorai calls for medical assistance for Po Lin, the injured girl apologizes to Chun Li, and says that she was right, apparently referring to her reaction to Po Lin's desire to shoot Sagat in the back of the head.</p><p>On the sub, Sagat remarks that Bison will have to make due with the six statues they managed to load on board. When he touches one, however, he suddenly receives a vision from the future. He sees a fighter, his face hidden in shadows, unleashing a brutal uppercut to his midsection, defeating him and leaving a permenant scar. The visions convince Sagat that Bison should never possess the statues, and the power they possess, so he destroys them and reports his failure to Bison. He says that none of the statues were retrieved due to Dorai's interference. Frowning, Bison states his resolve to do something about Dorai soon.</p><p>Later, Chun Li visits Po Lin in the hospital, where Po Lin tells her that she will be resigning from the force because she can't let revenge be the primary thing guiding her through life. Chun Li says she understands, and later Dorai and Chun Li accompany Po Lin when she visits her parents graves and tells them that she now realizes that the best way she can honor them is by lving her own life as they had wanted her to.</p><p>As they walk away, Chun Li asks her father if he thinks she would make the same decisions that Po Lin had if Chun Li had lost him. He replies that he trusts her to always do the right thing, and we see that the two of them are being spied on by Shadaloo Agent Killer Bee, apparently moments before she abducts Dorai.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Issue #4 starts of in Gotham, before Tim left.  He's in the Red Robin suit, heading towards Gotham Airport.  He stops to look back at Gotham asking what is he doing?  Dick shows up in the Bat Suit telling him they need to talk.   <br/>In Baghdad Tim see's the three Assassins, wondering why they're there.  Then realizing that giving Ra's orders probably wouldn't have worked.  As he reached for the throwing discs, deciding that this is going to have to be public, he gets surrounded by Military Police.  Tim thinks his short career as Red Robin is over.  They believe Tim to be his Alias, Alvin Draper, and intend to bring him in for questioning.  Tim traveled too quickly after Berlin and it appears to German Government are on to him.  \"Z\" shows up, appearing to be a Wayne Enterprises employee, telling the Sergeant that there has been a mistake.  He tells them he is Tim's bodyguard, saying this is Tim Drake.  Tim explains to the Sergeant that he is here to see the head of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce Wayne, his adoptive father.  Once everything checks out Tim turns to the assassins who tell him they are here whether he likes it or not.  Back in Berlin, Tam Fox seems to be tracing Tim's tracks.  In Baghdad Tim feels like he's on Bizzaro world and Ra's is his new Alfred, Butler of the Damned.  Ra's again tries to get Tim to tell him why he thinks Bruce is alive.  For the first time we see what Tim got from Germany.  It appears to be part of a wall, with a boomerang/batarang on it.  \"Z\" knocks on his door telling him they should prepare.  Tim tries to brush him off, but he tells him how he's been studying him for weeks and that he usually isn't as arrogant as he is being.  Telling him to keep his emotions in check, he reminds him this isn't Gotham, telling him of the dangers of the area.  Tim asks why he is helping him and we learn that they fought together, back when they resurrected Ra's.  He tells him he fought to bring him back just as Tim is trying to bring back his \"father\" now.  \"Z\" tells him he knows how he feels now, lost.  He says his mission is a unique one, different from killing someone, this time he gets to restore a life; Tim's   <br/> <br/>Tim begins to question how far he is willing to go.  He doesn't see the line anymore.  As Robin he never crossed that line, nor did Batman.  It seems that all Tim is doing now is compromising.  He hopes it's worth it.  Back in Gotham before, Dick approaches Tim telling him he wants to believe Bruce is alive but after everything they've gone through before the Crisis, it was like Bruce knew this was going to be it.  He says we're not like the others, Gods or Aliens.  Bruce was a man, and they buried him.  Dick wants to help him, but Tim says no and tells Dick to let go of him.  Tim throws Dick over his shoulder.  Back in Baghdad Tim and the Assassins are in a jeep, Owens is telling a story about Pru and the White Ghost's first meeting.  He broke 11 of her bones, to which Tim quickly says that breaking her nose 3 times isn't anything new to her.  The two males laugh at the joke.  Tim goes back to thinking about how Ra's calls Bruce \"Detective.\"  He remembers how he knew that Dick Grayson was Robin and Bruce Wayne was Batman.  He then says he had the same type of moment recently.  He knows Bruce is alive, and even though the evidence is insane and the trail is cold, he knows Bruce is alive.  Upon entering a cave he sees a Bat Symbol drawn on the wall telling Tim, Bruce is lost and the trail begins here.   <br/> <br/>Back in Gotham Tim confronts Dick saying that he knows how it sounds, and asks him if he thinks he doesn't know that.  He knows that it sounds like he's snapped, but he's going to prove it because he knows he's right.  Dick tries to tell him about a therapist in Metropolis but Tim tells him they're done here.  He tells him he's leaving and Dick has to let him.  He explains that if he meant what he said about them being partners and if he really meant it, if he really is his brother then he should have earned Dick's belief in him.  Tim tells Dick to take care of Gotham and not let Damian destroy everything they built as Robin.  If there is even a chance of Bruce being out there he has to try.  Dick watches as Tim leaves, not saying a word.   <br/> <br/>Back in Baghdad, Tim realizes he was looking at the wall for an hour, he exits the cave to find the 3 assassins still there.  \"Z\" asks him how he feels.  Tim's response is a smile, Pru jokes about getting a bonus because of this.  However, there is a noise and \"Z\" is stabbed through chest.  The Widower calls out the remaining Assassins asking for them to put up a fight.  He slices Pru and Owens and heads towards Tim saying he wasn't on the list but stabs Tim anyway.  He tells Tim the council of Spiders appreciates their participation in the game.  Tim's mind starts to race, saying how he knew he was right, and that the compromises were going to end.  He would find himself again.  He feels the blood rushing out of his body he says soon he'll be dead like \"Z\" and Owens.  He see's Pru bleeding out and again he says he knew he was right.  He thought he would die as Robin.  Ra's asks Tim if he found what he was looking for.  When there is no response he calls out \"Timothy?\"</p>",

John Dusk is in that situation now. Except the perp isn't in John's custody, he's in the NYPD's. And they don't torture. If John takes matters into his own hands, with everyone watching...everything changes. He's always told himself he brutalized criminals to save innocents. But will he NOT torture and kill to save himself, even if it means others die? John always knew there would come a time when he had to choose between his two lives. That time is now. And either way, there's no going back. He wants to be forgiven...but he doesn't want to stop.

Still, whether it's simply his programming or a newly found free will, Sereda is hell bent on effecting the rescue of the woman whose voice brought him down into the bewildering maze of a seemingly endless necropolis. Most of the surviving planetary prospectors are willing to follow him into the labyrinth, but there are two major obstacles to the rescue mission: a horde of marauding xenomorphs, and the man who shot Sereda, who isn't about to let a damaged synthetic lead the other survivors anywhere.</i>",

Wellington Wimpy. “Plunder Island” is presented here for the first time in its complete, full-color, uncut glory!</i></p><p><i>Meanwhile, in the “dailies” section of <b>Popeye Volume 4</b>, Popeye visits “Poodleburg” and gets involved in a quest for both “Romance and Riches.” Other stories include “Unifruit” (featuring the return of King Blozo), the western epic “Black Valley” (with the unforgettable sight of Popeye in drag), “The Pool of Youth” (featuring the return of the Sea Hag... and her sister!); and the beginning of the extended six-month-long yarn “Popeye’s Ark”!</i></p><p><i>Comics historian Richard Marschall rounds off this volume with a long article on Segar’s storytelling skills and narrative strategies, focusing in particular on the “Plunder Island” sequence. Rediscover an American treasure in this handsomely designed series to be enjoyed by comic fans of all ages.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Mark Schultz’s Various Drawings series returns with this fourth dazzling collection. His best work over the last two years features continued experimentation with graphite, charcoal, brush and ink, and color-tinted images exemplifying his continued growth as an artist.</em></p><p><em>Highlighting this compilation is Schultz’s new Pulpette personal works. These four plates combine Mark’s love for pulp magazine imagery combined with classic pin-up style art. Development sketches showcase his stages of production.</em></p><p><em>Also included are preliminary pieces and a self-rejected sample for his upcoming illustrated novella, Storms at Sea as well as new Xenozoic Tales specialty drawings. Additional illustrations include recent commissions, spotlighted by an evocative Helen of Troy nude. Completing this volume is a Martian fantasy gatefold, sketchbook experimentations, and Schultz’s contribution to Prince Valiant.</em></p><p><em>Over fifty illustrations are featured in this volume—the majority not publicly shown until now. The hardbound edition is limited to 800 copies. Exclusive to this edition is a bound in plate reproducing an unpublished illustration. Each copy is numbered and signed.</em></p>",
