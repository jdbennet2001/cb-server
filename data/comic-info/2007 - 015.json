            "description": "<p>Having a hard time accepting the idea of Jamie Madrox, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.? Well, that's nothing compared to what's going to happen when Jamie is captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.'s foremost opponents and is transformed into Jamie Madrox...Agent of Hydra! Plus...Siryn and Monet decide to go shopping and have a grand Mall seizure!</p><p>Two helicopters approach a lone island, sitting alone in the ocean. One is a standard transport, the other an aerial crane cargo helicopter, ferrying a rail container. After the two craft land at an airport landing strip, the girl previously disguised as a girl scout jumps from the transport, joining a small cadre of rifle-wielding Hydra soldiers at the door to the rail container. When the door opens, the soldiers roll out a platform, in the center of which is a harness, designed to completely inhibit the movements of the occupant incarcerated within. So imprisoned is Jamie Madrox, the Multiple Man.</p><p>Actually, the agents of Hydra have confused him with one of Madox’s dupes, who is currently working as an agent for SHIELD, the “Super Hero Intimidation and Evisceration Division.” Not that he’s told them that, of course. <i>Never a dull moment</i>, he thinks.</p><p>“Hail Hydra! Immortal Hydra!” one of the soldiers shouts as they wheel him into a building. “Cut off a limb and two more shall take its place,” another cites, finishing the organization’s meme. To this, the immobilized Madrox quips that it must be tough to find shirts if <i>that</i> keeps happening. Hearing this, the girl rhetorically remarks that he’s awake. In response, Madrox denies it. Explaining that he’s just talking in his sleep with superb comedy timing.</p><p>Ignoring him, the girl instructs the soldiers to take him to Doctor Locke, so the procedure can begin. Incredulous, Madrox asks if she’s kidding him. “Doc Locke?” He’s in shock. Now annoyed, the girl orders her men to take him <i>now</i>. “Bet he’s a crock,” Madrox continues. Shedding her outfit to reveal her Hydra uniform, the girl orders the men faster, causing Madrox to ask if she doesn’t want him to <i>mock</i> Doc Locke?</p><p>Changing tact, Madrox asks the “little girl” if her “mommy” knows she’s playing with evil spies. To this, the girl replies that her mother recruited her, and she’s twenty-seven. As for Doctor Locke… he lent his talents to Singularity Investigations before joining them. Did some work on his <i>friend</i>, Mr. Carosella. Realizing aloud that he’s the one who brainwashed Guido into a murderer, Madrox says that he can’t wait to meet him.</p><p>Doctor Locke is an older man, though not so old as to deny him either his hair or its brown color. Though wearing a Hydra uniform, it is mostly covered by a long, dark coat. Before him, he grasps a hooked, wooden cane with both hands. Smiling wryly, Locke informs James Madrox, agent of SHIELD, that it’s a pleasure and an honor. Singularity Investigations had extensive files on Madrox Prime that they shared with him. He could make a most interesting subject for dissertation. Is he comfortable, Locke then asks. Can he get him anything? Now strapped down in an immense chair, Madrox answers simply, “A gun with a bullet I can put in your brain” When the grinning Locke rejoins that such violence isn’t in his character, Madrox replies that he shouldn’t be so sure. He’s got <i>lots</i> of character.</p><p>Placing a goggled helmet over Madrox’s head, Locke replies that he has heard “Madrox Prime” has quite a few rattling around his head. So should he as well, he says, referring to the “Madrox dupe.” All of them have many sides, but <i>his</i> make themselves manifest. He makes Bruce Banner look like the mental health poster boy. As he then returns to his desk, examining his laptop computer, Madrox, now wearing the helmet, calls out to the “Doc.” When Locke responds, his back still to his prisoner, Madrox informs him that he <i>wasn’t</i> kidding. He’s going to kill him. Unfazed, Locke tells Madrox his go right on thinking that. Now announcing that they’re going to being, Locke pressed a key on the keypad, beginning the program. Once they’re done, he tells the now screaming Jamie Madrox, they’ll unleash him on SHIELD… and allow hilarity to ensue.</p><p>Resonating through the streets of Paris, a bellowing yell, more in the type of deep laughter than a scream, is heard. Following this, the source of the laughter, Theresa Rourke, asks Monets if she’s serious. She and <i>both</i> princes? Replying that she swears to God, Monet adds that they were there at reception, both with dates… and they both ditch their dates to hang on her arms. The tabloids were scandalized. And now… When Theresa they asks “and now… what?” Monet looks off to the side. The toast of two continents… royalty falling all over her… and whom does she bed? Jamie Madrox. That may be fine for <i>her</i>, she tells Theresa, but…</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, Theresa remarks that for Monet it’s slumming, but for her a peasant it’s okay. To this, Monet begins to remark that she wasn’t saying that exactly, but then quickly reconsiders and remarks that, on second thought, she guesses she was. Now sporting a smile, she asks Theresa if she’s expecting her to apologize for that, is she? Rolling her eyes, Theresa replies that that was her first impulse, but she supposes if she moved in the circles she’s accustomed to as the daughter of an ambassador… heck… she’d probably feel the same way. Thoughtfully examining her glass of wine, Monet remarks that she appreciated that. No problem, “skank,” Theresa rejoins. When Monet does a verbal double-take, Theresa replies that she said, “No problem, thanks,” taking a drink from her water bottle to cover her smile.</p><p>Monet begins to press jokingly, but she is suddenly distracted by a smell. At first, Theresa does not detect it, but then does so a moment later. Something’s burning, she says, rising to follow it to its source. A minute later, shopping bags still in hand, the two come across a crowd gathered around a sidewalk, whereupon a body with two heads and six arms is being burned in effigy. In disgust as well as disbelief, Theresa asks Monet what they are shouting. Translating, Monet replies that they’re protesting mutants… or rather former mutants.</p><p>Approaching a random person, Monet asks him something in French. When he replies, again in French, she follows up with another few. When it is obvious he has finished, Theresa asks for a translation, to which Monet complies. She explains that there’s a bunch of former mutants living there – like a mini-mutant town. Apparently the “norms” have noticed and they show up to slap them around.</p><p>(unreality)</p><p>Hanging on a scarecrow frame in the middle of a fenced field, Jamie Madrox is slapped by his mother. Covering the field are a number of duplicates, all unconscious. Angrily asking if he calls himself a son, she tells him that they have him everything, and what was the result? They’re dead because of him. Jamie begins to say he’s sorry, but is interrupted by another slap from his mother, who tells him to stop apologizing.</p><p>Continuing, Joan Madrox tells Jamie that, if they’d had a normal child, then Mr. Tryp wouldn’t have taken an interest in him! Wouldn’t have caused the storms that killed them! Sweating, Jamie replies that he doesn’t know why he did it! And why didn’t he just… just take him away? He grew up <i>alone</i>! Why… “Who cares!?” Joan replies.</p><p>Joining his wife, Daniel Madrox stops her from slapping their son once again. He explains that there’s no use just slapping the boy in the face over and over. Where’s the point in that? Closing his eyes for a moment, Jamie thanks his father, but then has a horrified realization as he opens them again. He sees his father, whip in hand, explain to his wife that they’re going to drive home to him what a failure he’s been… they can’t afford to spare the rod. Exasperated, Jamie replies that that’s <i>not</i> a rod! It’s a freakin’ whip! He then suggests they let his mom go back to slapping him, or… or use an actual rod! Then he doesn’t have to spare a thin… Ignoring his son, Daniel Madrox cracks the whip, yelling, “Shut up, you miserable little puke!”</p><p>(reality)</p><p>Still in the Hydra lab, the goggled helmet filling his sight and senses, Jamie Madrox yells. Regarding this, the faux girl scout asks Doctor Locke what, precisely, he is doing. His back to Madrox, instead examining the readouts on the laptop, Locke replies that Madrox’s strength come from his numbers, obviously. By mentally splitting him off more and more, he <i>weakens</i> his core personality. Divest it of its protections, as it were, he continues, thus making it easy to manipulate. When she replies that it sounds as if it could take some time, Locke tells Ms. Diaz that, objectively, that’s true, but not <i>subjectively</i>. In the real world, ten minutes have passed. From Madrox’s perspective, it’s been about a day of mental torture. And the disparity will increase exponentially. <i>Weeks’</i> worth of reprogramming will pass in <i>hours</i>.</p><p>Pleased at this, Ms. Diaz asks what Madrox is seeing now. To this, Locke replies that he has no clue, specifically. He’s simply stimulating relevant sections of the brain and letting his subconscious do the rest. Magnificent, isn’t it, he asks. The human brain. What <i>they</i> can do to it… and it to them. To this, Diaz replies that eighty-percent of Americans hate their job. She suspects that Locke is not among them. Grinning slightly, Locke replies that she’s quite right. Oh, quite right.</p><p>Yelling in French down with a clenched fist from her window to the assembled crowd below, a woman find an expertly thrown tomato splattered across her face. Spying this, Monet tells Theresa that that’s it. She’s making a move here. Replying that she’s got her back, Theresa opens her mouth and lets forth the scream of her alter ego, Siryn, to the crowd, bowling over the protestors. When one of the protestors intends to respond to the attack with a pistol, it is Monet who steps forward, the bullets bouncing harmlessly against her chest.</p><p>Monet’s smile, however, quickly turns to horror as she notices that a bullet bounced off her and shattered the Victor Mayer Faberge egg she just bought. As the gunman then begins to fumble with his gun, Monet’s ire rises. With bared teeth and nails, she informs that man that he is <i>so</i> dead, “monsieur.” A moment later, she is upon the man. However, before she can act, she is yelled at in English to stop, followed by another command in French. Down the alley are French officials, whom Theresa recognizes as the Gendarmes.</p><p>Taking stock, Monet asks if they should book out of there. It’s not like they can stop them. She then begins to translate the gendarme’s next order, but Theresa has surmised it. He wants them to raise their hands. But, Theresa continues Monet’s thought, if they fly off this gets spun into yet another mutant-terrorizes-innocent-people horror story. And the helpless ex-mutants clustered in these buildings remain sitting ducks? Monet asks. Exactly, Theresa rejoins.</p><p>Stepping forward, her arms raised, Monet speaks to the Gendarmes in French. Behind her, Theresa likewise raises her arms.</p><p>Examining Jamie Madrox, now clad in a Hydra uniform and sporting a blank expression, Diaz asks Doctor Locke if he’s certain he’s ready. Locke replies with an “absolutely,” adding that he’s stripped his personality down to its core. A <i>tabula rasa</i>, as it were. He then explains that Madrox now merely needs to be reprogrammed in the interests of Hydra. She may, however, he then tells Diaz, wish to reconsider her current plan.</p><p>When she asks why, Locke replies that using him as a stealth agent or infiltrator is shortsighted. He would make an idea combat agent. When she then asks what techniques he is skilled in, Locke replies that he has no clue. But they’re talking quantity over quality. Telling her to watch, Locke raps his cane against Madrox’s back, producing a dupe. When Diaz then replies with an “amazing,” Locke then rejoins that it’s not merely amazing. He asks her to envision him holding a single nuclear device. The duplicate would likewise be holding it. Imagine a nuclear army. When Diaz ten asks how that is remotely possible, Locke replies that he’s honestly not sure. There’s more going on with him than mere <i>cellular</i> replication.</p><p>Back in the reality of the fenced field, Daniel Madrox tells his wife that he still doesn’t think their son understands how bad he’s been. Definitely, Joan replies with a sneer. And there’s only so long they can punish him. That’s true, Daniel rejoins. If he’s ever going to grow up… he’s going to have to start taking responsibility. Now addressing their son, Daniel Madrox tells Jamie that he’s untied his hands. Make them proud. Punish himself, Joan adds. Sitting on his knees, Jamie slaps himself, announcing, “I’m bad!”</p><p>Back in the Hydra base, Diaz regards the two new Madrox dupes, created by the two precious Madri having slapped themselves. When she asks him if he knew he was going to do that, Locke replies that it was… a <i>little</i> unexpected. Still, he continues, the human mind can’t be turned on and off, like a light switch.</p><p>A moment later, to the surprise of both Diaz and Locke, all four Madri slap themselves, producing another for dupes as they all pronounce, “I’m bad.” The resulting eight then repeat the procedure, resulting in a total of sixteen. Within his personal world in his head, Jamie Madrox continues to punish himself, per his parents’ instructions. In the real world, Diaz and Locke begin to panic, as the facility has begun to fill up exponentially with dupes of Jamie Madrox. Calling out to the arriving Hydra troops, Locke orders them to do something. Stop him!</p><p>The leader of the troops orders his men to fire at the original. While they try to comply, opening fire, one of the men asks which one is the original. Unfortunately for the troops, the Madri have continued to double every few seconds, overwhelming them. <i>So very… very… very… VERY…</i></p><p>Standing in stark, cold cell, sporting an extremely nasty toilet, Monet yells to her and Theresa’s jailors in French. Sitting down on a bench in a resigned manner, Theresa tells Monet to calm down. When Monet then yells back for <i>her</i> to calm down, Theresa exasperatedly rejoins that she is.</p><p>Still incredulous, Monet reminds Theresa that playing nice with the authorities was <i>her</i> bright idea. And it was a good one, Theresa counters. She saw! Reporters were waiting for them! The gendarmes couldn’t stop them from telling them about the riots! About making a political statement! Plus, they showed them they don’t think mutants are above the law. With all of the negative press the US is getting because of the Civil War, she thinks that was an <i>important</i> point to make. Still incredulous, Monet replies that, really, somehow America’s image is less important to her than finding a proper <i>toilet</i> if the needs arises. So if…</p><p>Theresa interrupts Monet’s rant by pointing out the newcomer to the jail, being led to a different cell. When Theresa remarks that she knows him, Monet points out that he was at the demonstration. Noticing that he is covered in ash, Theresa wonders what happened, leading Monet to ask the man in French. However, the man replies in English, asking if she and her Irish friend really want to know… They burned, he says with a smile. “We burned them out. All the freaks. All the monsters. We went back after the police left, and burned them up. Ashes to ashes… dust to d…”</p><p>The man’s festive proclamation comes to a quick end with a “<i>spluch</i>”, when a piece of iron bar, ripped from her cell by her strength, is thrown with deadly accuracy by Monet, much to the astonishment of Theresa. When Theresa asks her what, in Mary mother of God, did she do, Monet replies coldly and emotionlessly. She made a political statement.</p><p>Back at the Hydra island base, two new helicopters arrive, this time producing agents of SHIELD, who quickly storm the facility. However, to their surprise, as they rush inside, yelling for nobody to move, they find the few Hydra agents present very much dead. Regarding this, one of the SHIELD agents remarks that they don’t think they’re going to be moving anytime soon.</p><p>Taking charge, the field leader instructs his men to spread out and search for survivors. They should se if they can find whoever it was who contacted them… blew the whistle on them. Now joined by Agent Madrox, who asks if he has any clue what happened, the field leader remarks that the bodies… they look like they were crushed. When another agent asks how… and by what… Agent Madrox suggests that they find out…</p><p>A few moments later, Agent Madrox calls his men over to a downed Hydra agent, who seems to still be alive. To his surprise, however, the Hydra agent is actually Jamie Madrox – the original, who reaches out to his dupe, grabbing his wrists with a “Gotcha!” Agent Madrox has but a moment to yell in protest.</p><p>A moment later, another SHIELD agent converges on Agent Madrox, asking if he found something. Rising, the Agent Madrox replies, “no,” then haltingly saying that he made a mistake. Noticing his fellow agent’s demeanor, he asks him if he’s all right, which Agent Madrox confirms.</p><p>As the other agent goes elsewhere, continuing the search, Agent Madrox – in actuality the “prime” Jamie Madrox – thinks that he’s actually a long way from “fine.” He can still hear his SHIELD agent personal screaming in protest. But that’s fade before long. They always do.</p><p>Bizarre, he thinks, as he heads for the exit. The more dupes he created, the more it “thinned out” Locke’s control, until he finally broke free. And all these Hydra agents… dead… because of him. Frightening. But the most frightening thing of all… is that he doesn’t feel anything. No regret. No horror. No elation. Just… empty. And that’s bad.</p><p>Very… very… bad.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Operation: Lightning Storm goes into full effect as Ms. Marvel targets the terrorist organization that has been a thorn in her side for years! That’s right, the leader of the Mighty Avengers has declared a one-woman war against A.I.M. and its fearful leader M.O.D.O.K.! Be there as Ms. Marvel continues her battle to become “the best of the best,” courtesy of writer Brian Reed (NEW AVENGERS: ILLUMINATI) and penciler Aaron Lopresti (INCREDIBLE HULK)!</em></p><p>In Anderson, Indiana, A.I.M. agents have obtained the DNA bomb that was hidden at the sight Ms. Marvel's team just discovered. Waiting for them outside, is the A.I.M. agent, Madigan. He pulls out a couple of guns and shoots them.</p><p>In Manhattan, Carol is having dinner with William Wagner. She is amazed at how calm he is over all her superhero activities and interruptions. They have a pleasant dinner, walk in the park, and even ended up at his place, with no interruptions. She wakes in the morining to find herself lying next to Simon Williams, aka Wonder Man. She has no idea how that happened and her thoughts are interrupted by a deet deet sound. Now she wakes up onboard the helicarrier.</p><p>Deputy Director Maria Hill is buzzing at the door to her quarters. They had a meeting scheduled. Maria isn't too happy that Carol has obtained S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and a minicarrier without going through the proper channels. She questions her methods of attacking an A.I.M. facility without authorization and used S.H.I.E.L.D. equipment to help a known felon (Arachne) kidnap her own daughter. Carol reminds her that Tony Stark approved all (or at least most) of that. Maria insinuates that Carol used questionable methods with Tony to get his approval. She tells her of what just happened at Indiana with the two agents watching the place having been killed along with two A.I.M. agents. It's up to Carol to clean up her own mess and Maria makes another subtle insinuation that leaves Carol irrate.</p><p>In Indiana, Carol and her Lightning Storm agents (including Wonder Man) search the place again. One of the agents discovers that A.I.M. has been able to hide things in the six other dimensions that we cannot detect with our senses. A.I.M. was hiding something in plain site.</p><p>Suddenly the entire room starts to shimmer. They find themselves in an A.I.M. science base. They are surrounded and ordered to drop their weapons. Scientist Supreme (Monica Rappaccini) is there overseeing their arrival. Carol is about to attack her when neural inhibitors are activated. Their motor skills are shut down too. Carol is still able to communicate to her telepathic agent. She prepares to try to do something when they are teleported back when the A.I.M. agents tell the Supreme Scientist that the bomb was not there.</p><p>Carol's agent tells her that they had a scan to detect if there was something in the other dimensions. Apparently when something is removed, it leaves an energy trail. They will be able to track it.</p><p>At an another A.I.M. research base, M.O.D.O.K. expresses his disappointment that they have not been able to obtain the DNA bomb. It seems that M.O.D.O.K.'s body is infected with a disease. They need the scrambler to help him. It turns out that the agent helping M.O.D.O.K. is really Madigan. There are different factions of A.I.M. that want different things. The men he is talking to wants M.O.D.O.K. dead so they can control A.I.M. for themselves. Monica wants M.O.D.O.K. dead so she can have A.I.M. for herself. Ms. Marvel and her Lightning Storm is involved too and is shaking things up for the two sides. Madigan has decided that both M.O.D.O.K. and A.I.M. have to die so that he can re-create A.I.M. He figures they will better cause destruction as a bunch of small cells rather than one poorly managed group that can barely get anything done.</p><p>Just then, Carol's minicarrier is seen outside the window and a squadron of A.I.M. troops teleport in.</p><p>Carol and her agents crash through the window. A.I.M. throws a Dark Door device at them. Carol grabs it and flies out asking what it is. It's a device that can produce a portable black hole. It was designed to wipe out an entire city. Carol thinks it feels too light and that it has to be fake. She opens it and is right.</p><p>As she's outside opening the fake device, M.O.D.O.K. teleports in. He takes over Wonder Man's mind. He orders him to kill Ms. Marvel and he is at her throat in seconds.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>The stunning \"Circle\" story arc ratchets to a new level of intensity as Wonder Woman's acclaimed new creative team deliver never-before-revealed secrets of Diana's origin! Who tried to assassinate her on the night of her creation? Special Agent Diana Prince may not live to find out, as she faces a brutal Captain Nazi alone, unable to use her powers. And the re-forming army of the Society of Super Villains hunts her mother on Paradise Island!</p><p>You've never seen a Wonder Woman like this!</p><p>Four personal guards for Hippolyta have been chosen, and they are Myrtyo, Charis, Philomela and Alkyone. At a campfire, the newly chosen guards and swear that they will die before an enemy touches a lock of the queen’s hair. With that, they dip the sword into the fire and dance a ceremonial dance that no one can describe, but only see for themselves. At the city, Alkyone receives news of Hippolyta asking for another child. Alkyone replies in outrage, saying that it would destroy them. Alkyone doesn’t like the idea of this and asks someone to find out who has a child. The spy walks towards Alkyone and her team, and tells her that Gennes has a daughter. At first they are devastated that a baby is there, but Alkyone realises that it’s only a doll when she grabs it and it falls to the fall and breaks. Alkyone tells her team that this can’t spread and one asks what will become of Gennes. Alkyone orders them to kill her.</p><p>Back in America, Diana is held at her neck against a wall and between the pulling of her head to the pushing of her head against the wall, she says, “This is going to sting.” She goes through the wall but pulls Captain Nazi along with her and kicks him away. She makes her way back in the apartment and Captain Nazi makes his way back inside as well. Diana then throws a piece of that explosive on Captain Nazi’s face and presses the detonator, alerting the director, asking what that explosion was. Diana says it’s fine and Captain Nazi emerges from the rubble and sees the light reflecting off Wonder Woman’s bracelets and tiara. With her powers restored, beats down on Captain Nazi.</p><p>On Themyscira, the soldiers of Captain Nazi prepare their invasion and one captain orders for Themyscira to be completely destroyed. Hippolyta sees this in her magical mirror and it reminds her of the invasion of Hercules and what it had caused. “No. No more conquerors here,” she says and cuts a lock of her hair to prepare for battle.</p><p>Back in America, Captain Nazi wakes up in a world of total blackness, and Diana’s voice asks him if he recognises it. She tells him it’s his soul. She explains to him that she is in her lasso and that only the truth survives around here. She calms him, telling him what she knows, that his mother was a prostitute and his father was the one behind it, beating him, his brother and mother every day. Diana can’t help but feel sympathy even for him. With that, Captain Nazi tells her everything. He tells about the Shadow Society contact and the status on Themyscira, and their plan to exterminate the Amazons completely.</p><p>In less than half an hour, Diana’s back at her apartment, where Tom Tressor has suffered a mild concussion. Tolifhar is asking when they will go and get her mother, and Diana replies that she can’t ask them to get her mother for her, but before she can finish her answer, Tolifhar replies that that is entirely the point – that she doesn’t have to ask. Diana thanks Tolifhar for his help and says that she will not be sure if she can even get there. Tolifhar asks if it’s impossible, and Diana replies that it isn’t, and pulls out some golden sneakers with wings on them.</p><p>Back on Themyscira, a group of soldiers are discussing the island, the Red Point are explaining they’ve got some kind of strange artefact, something like a unicorn and dragon. Blue Point then asks if there’s any sign of the queen, and Blue Point replies with a negative. Hippolyta then ambushes the soldiers and easily puts them down one by one. Out of Blue Point’s radio is a, “Blue Point? Do you copy, Blue Point?” Hippolyta runs off and ambushes the next set of soldiers, where they’re discussing killing the animals. They hear a chain being broken with a sword and the leader of the group calls for formation when a green creature with many tentacles appears and finishes them off for Hippoyta. Outside, Hippolyta kneels down and prays for Athena, to give her wisdom on how to win this battle without anymore bloodshed and to grant her forgiveness for her enemies. Failing that, though… give her good aim. For tonight, a debt is paid in Amazon blood.</p><p>Cutting back to Wonder Woman, she calls for the other gods to help. She makes her way to Odin and asks for his help. She asks for help from Raijin, the Thunder God. She asks for help from the daughter of the Bast, but all of them refuse. She asks for help from Kane Moihai, God of the Sky and the Heavens. She pleads to him, saying that they will help him and his people if they are in need of help. He accepts her plead, and says that if she were ever to be her champion, she would have to wear her standard battle gear as a joke, which is basically a loin cloth. Before she leaves, he gives a shell, which will grow into a vessel and will take her anywhere she needs to go.

To illustrate their story, we have selected hundreds of amazing pictures – iconic images from the BBC archive, alongside less familiar shots from private collections.</em></p><p><em>This volume – covering a brave new era for the series, as it was broadcast in colour for the first time, and headed in a more serious, grown-up direction – provides a complete primer for newcomers, and a valuable refresher for hardened aficionados. It plots a brilliant assortment of Earth-based sci-fi and Hammer-style gothic horror, unravels the glory years of UNIT, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, and Sarah Jane Smith, chronicles the arrival of Tom Baker, recognised across the world as a quintessential Doctor, and recalls a menagerie of iconic monsters – Autons, Sea Devils, giant maggots and spiders, Sontarans, Zygons, and Davros, creator of the Daleks. Plus, hear the story of how the Master came to be, and how the show delved further than ever before into the legend of the Time Lords …</em></p><p><em>Featuring contributions from Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks, Philip Hinchcliffe, Robert Holmes, Malcolm Hulke, Terry Nation, Nicholas Courtney, Katy Manning, Elisabeth Sladen, Ian Marter, Michael Wisher and hundreds more – plus an Afterword by actor and writer Mark Gatiss!</em></p>",
