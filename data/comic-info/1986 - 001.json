As he explores this bizarre new post-nuclear world, the only thing on his mind is, can he get back to his own era? Ever?</i></p><p>Jonah Hex suddenly finds himself transported to a strange new world. At first, he believes that he is still in a saloon in Red Dog, preparing for a gunfight with Brett. When his old foe El Papagayo barges through the door, Hex guns him down, only to discover that his adversary is in fact a robot.</p><p>Jonah runs out the front door and discovers that he is trapped inside of a large scientific research station in the future. The administrator of the facility is Reinhold Borsten, a cruel, analytical man, who takes responsibility for transporting Hex from the 19th century into the mid 21st century. Jonah fights past a few of Borstens' guards, but they ultimately capture him and place him into a prison capsule.</p><p>Jonah manages to break free of confinement and escapes from the station. He races out into the desert, where he encounters several thugs beating up on a young woman. Jonah saves her life, and finds that her name is Stiletta a member of a desert gang known as the Road Reapers. Stiletta introduces Jonah to her friends, and tells him of their plan to steal supplies of water from Borsten's crew. Jonah begins to suspect that he may have allied himself with the wrong side.</p><p>Borsten sends a squad of soldiers to take down the Road Reapers. He quips that one of the Reapers is actually a spy for his organization. A firefight ensues and Jonah finds himself caught in the middle. He and another Reaper named Falcon hole up inside of a tank and keep several of the marauders at bay. When they emerge, Falcon betrays Jonah and attempts to leave him in the desert for dead. Jonah fights back, and manages to defeat Falcon. He takes his coat and hover cycle and speeds off into the sunset.</p>",

Orm is now much stronger and has Aquaman on the ropes but then disappears in order to further torment Aquaman with the knowledge he can kill him at any time.

Aquaman tries to retrieve the seal and has to wear a new costume so that he can not be recognized by the people that have him as well as it is a black ops mission that the current king of Atlantis Vulko can not be tied to.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The first panel in this issue is during 30000 BC where a caveman does not consider himself a man, owing to the fact that he has lost his hand to a sabertooth tiger. He enters a cave and finds a woman in there. He hides in the shadow so the woman cannot see him. The woman approaches offering solicitude, but the man misinterprets her actions as pity, and for that he kills her. Her soul is then pulled away.</p><p>Now, 1200 BC, on Mount Olympus, the gods are arguing. Artemis wishes to create a new mortal race, but Ares says that if that happens, he is to take lead. Artemis does not want that to happen as she fears the mortals will fear the gods rather than look up to them. Athena backs Artemis, saying that Ares will eventually destroy them all. The debate then moves on to the sex of the new race. Zeus is angry, saying that it doesn't matter if the race is created or not, as it should be left with the gods who are involved to settle it themselves. Artemis then asks Hera to intervene for her against Zeus, but she doesn't want to as Zeus is still angry. Ares also leaves angry, stating that all gods, even Zeus shall be under his thumb. The gods and goddesses involved proceed with the plan, along with Zeus' blessings. Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Aphrodite and Hestia travel to Hell, where Hades lives, to the Cavern of Souls. This was the place where Gaea had gathered souls of tortured women. The goddesses casted a spell which transported the souls to Greece where they are used on Amazons. The first one is Hippolyta and then Antiope and grants them the gifts of the goddesses. Hippolyta is made queen as the both of them are given the Girdles of Gaea. However, one soul remains, and that one is yet to be used.</p><p>The Amazons are successful at first, but because of that, Greek kings become jealous and the Amazons then become outcasts. Heracles and Thesus with his men approach Themyscira. Menalippe has foreseen this day and dreads it. Heracles and and Hippolyta fight each other, and Hippolyta defeats him. Heracles then considers them allies. Overtime, the Amazons gain their good reputation back. Heracles and his men with the Amazons are fine with each other, becoming good friends, but Menalippe has a strange feeling about this. Hippolyta is drugged by Heracles and wakes to find herself chained. He takes her girdle and leaves.</p><p>Hippolyta prays, hoping that the gods will forgive her for failing them. Athena frees them, hoping that they will redeem themselves as they fight the rest of the men on the island. Antiope however is angry and wishes to take revenge on Heracles. Hippolyta tells her that if she did this, she would not be a true Amazon as they would never do this. Antiope parted with some of the Amazons and set out to find Heracles. Poseidon parts a path, and for three months, the Amazons walk to their new destination, hoping to rebuild Themyscira in a new location. Upon arriving, they build their new city. After 30 centuries, Hippolyta wishes to have a child and the gods order her to make a baby out of clay. With the final soul, they imbue the clay baby with it, and with it, the child has great abilities. She is named Diana and she is deemed one of the greatest warriors. The gods cry out that Ares has gone made and is planning to take over and that someone must face him alone. Diana wishes to take part, but her mother does not allow her too. Come to the tournament in which a winner will be chosen to face Ares, they were to wear masks to bring their full potential out, in case their were any close friends competing. Diana competes and wins and is awarded these silver bracelets. Diana explains that Athena asked her to do this, and Menalippe tells Hippolyta that the gods had her to do this, and that she shouldn't question it, as it was for the greater good.</p><p>Diana needs to pass one last test however. In the temple of Hades, Philippus aims a gun at her and fires three times, but Diana blocks the bullets with her revolver. She asks her mother where such bracelets came from, but her mother would rather not answer, as now was not the best time. She is also fitted with a new costume, after Diana Trevor, who she was named after.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>32 pages and no ads.</li><li>\"<em>The Wonder of it All</em>\" front inside cover contains a one page text piece by George Perez.</li><li>Back inside cover contains a black and white preview of the cover to issue #2.</li></ul>",

When Franklin tries to tell his father about this, he sends him to his mother. While unpacking old things, Sue finds the journal from Franklin’s dreams, reads it and later confronts her husband with her horrible findings. Near Muir Isle, Longshot and Dazzler spot and rescue a shipwrecked sailor. In the meantime, Magneto informs the X-Men that he has learned that Reed Richards has created an experimental device that might save Shadowcat’s life. He intends to talk to the FF. He meets the Things and She-Hulk, who accidentally met each other, and together they and the Torch save a house from breaking down. Nevertheless, the Thing and the Torch mistrust Magneto, as he tells them and Reed of his problem. Reed is torn whether or not to help but finally relents. On way to Muir, he asks Ben whether he is ruthless and learns that his friend considers him so certain that it is a kind of ruthlessness. Ben also refers to the fact that he’s never been wrong before… except for the rocket flight that turned them into the Fantastic Four. Horrified at this and by what he has learned from the journal, Reed sinks into an emotional slump, completely uncertain what to do, aware of the fact that he might condemn Shadowcat either way. After examining her, he refuses to help, claiming that the device is experimental and the risk too high. Magneto refuses to take “no” for an answer, leading to a fight, which is acerbated by Wolverine, who threatens Richards with the words from Franklin’s prophetic dream. </p>",

            "description": "<p>We start with a Wolverine in Eastern Europe with his 'best' friend Charlie. The Russian KGB are after Charlie and Wolverine defends him in pretty grisly style by slaying about a dozen men, despite being shot.</p><p>We then check in with Spidey in NYC. He checks out a Mom 'n' Pop store that he sometimes frequents. They have been murdered and, much to his own revulsion, he takes photos that he then sells to the Bugle. After stopping in at Aunt May's and taking in a movie with MJ, Pete is in Times Square. His Spidey-sense kicks in but only intermittently. He reasons that there must be a sniper somewhere. After changing into his outfit down a back alley (an old scene that seems refreshingly new), he tries to help but ends up with the police shooting at him.</p><p>Later, at MJ's and Pete is unforgiving of himself that he couldn't stop people being killed. MJ says it wasn't his fault and they kiss. Pete pulls away, thinking he has broken their trust.</p><p>Elsewhere, Ned Leeds is filling in Jonah about his story on the KGB. All the men murdered at Times Square were KGB men - so were 'Mom 'n' Pop'. Ned Leeds says the guy killing them all is Charlemagne (Charlie from the start with Wolverine). He wants to investigate but needs a photographer. In a cool cut of scenes we see Pete slinging his black costume away. He's had enough of Spidey. Pete wants to get away but as he's about to leave he can't resist answering his phone. It's Jonah ... and he's got a job for him.</p><p>Over in Berlin and Wolverine is looking for Charlie, as are Ned and Pete. On the street, Wolverine senses Pete's smell and knows he's Spider-Man. He tracks him to his hotel and, when he's alone goes into his room to make sure he's on the 'good' side. He invites Pete (who doesn't have a costume) out with him and Pete goes swinging off. There's a great line where Wolverine, who thinks Pete could be KGB thinks he's overdoing the act by saying 'Yes Aunt May' on the phone!</p><p>Wolverine tells Pete to go home - what's going on in Berlin is over his head. Pete wants to go home anyway to sort out his problems with MJ. He goes to tell Ned and walks into his hotel room to see Ned slumped, dead with his throat slit. He doesn't even notice his spidey-sense as KGB men are in the room too. Suddenly Wolverine bursts in a cleans house before tugging the still-shocked Pete to safety.</p><p>Pete's at the bus station, ready to leave but has second thoughts. He wonders if Wolverine drew him away from the hotel on purpose so Ned could be murdered. He goes back into the city and tries to buy some clothes he can be Spidey in. He wants something black and cool but ends up with ... a costume shop version of his old red and blue outfit - complete with webbing under the arms.</p><p>Spidey traces Wolverine to East Germany - across the wall back in those days. Wolfie is at a steel works that he says is a front for the KGB. He has found Charlie, who's a woman! After a quick snog, they go back to her huge house and Logan carries her up the stairs...</p><p>Whew! After that, Wolverine and Charlie are in a restaurant. Their food is poisoned (which they know), everyone inside has a weapon (which they know) and they are all out to kill them (which they also know). Anyway, Spidey bursts in and Charlie escapes while he and Wolverine take out the assassins. Later and Wolfie is filling Spidey in on the truth. Charlie was a KGB agent but they turned on her. Now she's taking them out one-by-one as payback.</p><p>The pair raid a KGB basement where Wolverine kills and Spidey hits some of the old agents. Wolverine tells Spidey to shine his 'bat belt' into a darkened room (great line!). There's just more dead agents though and Wolverine realises Charlie has already been there. He wants to stop her. He and Spidey have an argument about Spidey's appearance though and go their separate ways.</p><p>Later and Charlie has killed everyone on her list. She meets Wolverine in a cemetery. She wants him to kill her. She knows she'll get caught eventually and doesn't want to be tortured. As Wolverine goes to kill her, Spidey shows up and the two fight. It's good too. Spidey hits him with everything he's got but to no avail. Wolverine is on top of him they reason they could kill each other - Spidey by snapping his neck. As they stop, though, a helicopter's beam shines down upon them. Spidey is dazzled an as he feels what he thinks is Wolverine's hand on him, he turns and punches ... hard. But it's not Wolverine - it's Charlie.</p><p>She's dead.</p><p>The security services after her (the helicopter) see she's dead and move on. Spidey and Wolverine go their separate ways. Pete is haunted that he has killed. Back in NY and Jonah rings Pete to congratulate him on the quality of his pictures. Pete can't bring himself to tell him about Ned. MJ knocks on his door and they hug.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><ul><li>Ranked #19 in Wizard Magazine's list of \"100 Best Single Issue Comics Since You Were Born\".</li><li>A special epilogue to this one-shot was in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/web-of-spider-man-29-mask/4000-28471/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-28471\"><em>Web of Spider-Man #29</em></a>.</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p>The book opens with Denton and his friend 'Mazing Man walking through their neighborhood in New York City. Denton is an odd little man in that he looks like a dog. He's not a dog. He is a writer, and his friend is the self appointed protector of the neighborhood. A three foot harmless little man with a helmet and a cape.</p><p>While Patrolling the streets we meet some of the other characters in the series. A group of women who hang around the park with their children, they adore 'Mazing Man and appreciate the help he gives when he comes by.</p><p>He stops a shoplifter and gets knocked for a loop, where we find he has an infiniti for Simon and Garfunkle songs. We also get to meet Officer Muldavey, who can tolerate 'Mazing Man, but wants him to quit getting involved.</p><p>After his words with Officer Muldavy Denton decides to confront 'Mazing Man about what he does and his belief that he is a superhero. To use as a point, 'Mazing Man points to two men about to get into a fight saying, just because they are adversaries, does not mean they have to be enemies. Denton looses his cool and begins to yell at him, that the neighborhood sees him as a mascot and they sometimes laugh. 'Mazing Man just shrugs and says, \"I know they laugh, but I have to do it. It's my job\" as 'Mazing Man tries to get his friends approval, they hear a loud scream. A baby has gotten out of his stroller, and wandered into the street. Without hesitation 'Mazing Man runs towards the boy while no one else is moving and at the last moment saves the toddler. Proving why he is the neighborhood protector.</p><p>The second story introduces us to the neighbors. They are greeted by Mrs Constinis, who gives them an uncostumary two grunts and Guido. The Italian self proclaimed ladies man tough guy who lives in there building. We meet K.P. Dentons stepsister and roommate and a nice couple named Eddie and Brenda, who is not happy to discover that Eddie invited 'Mazing Man and Denton to dinner. The last part of the second story is all about how Eddie met 'Mazing Man.</p>",
