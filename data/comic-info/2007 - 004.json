            "description": "<p>Spider-Man crawls his way up the mayor's building. The Sinister Six is waiting inside. The kids continue to strike the old bell from the church tower. The noise is keeping the symbiotes back. The R.E.I.G.N. soldiers, led by the Sandman are under orders to stop them. The mayor calls them terrorists. As the Sandman steps forward to tell them they have no hope of winning, the little girl in charge goes off on him. She says hope has three daughters: Anger, Courage, and Truth. As she removes her mask, Sandman notices that she has his eyes. At this moment, she appears to turn into cement. Upon seeing the fact that she's a \"super\" or an \"illegal,\" the other men begin to open fire. Sandman unleashes his powers to get them to hold their fire. After being shot so many times, the girl is in a couple of pieces. Sandman picks her up and tells her it's going to be okay.</p> <p>With the bell stopped, Venom can now think again. Spider-Man bust through a window where Electro and Hydro-Man are. He quickly takes them out after reminding them that electricity and water don't mix. Scorpion is up next. He says with his new suit he can do anything. Spider-Man asks him if he can fly as he knocks him out the window. Mysterio tries rattling Spider-Man's mind by posing as Mary Jane. Spider-Man punches through his dome and knocks him out. Kraven is next, but he too is defeated.<br/></p> <p>Outside, Sandman tries to fight back the symbiotes as he still holds the girl he thinks is his daughter. He tells her to focus and try to reform herself. Suddenly the symbiotes leave. Thinking they've won, he looks down and finds the girl has died. Heading towards the building, he tells the soldiers to go home to their kids as he heads inside.</p> <p>Spider-Man finally arrives to confront Venom. The symbiote blames Spider-Man for bringing it to this planet and making it a prisoner. The mayor soon realizes that his plan on keeping the city safe with the help of Venom was a mistake. He turns to run as Spider-Man tries to battle Venom. As Spider-Man begins to black out, he sees himself as the nerdy high school student. Mary Jane walks up to him and gives him a pep talk. She tells him once again that she loves him and to \"go get 'em, Tiger.\"</p> <p>Smashing out a window, Spider-Man starts crawling to the top of the building. He notices that the people below are watching rather than running home. He knows he will probably die. He sees dying a way to make the people of the city fight harder. Followed by a hundred symbiotes, Spidey is in true form. He lets out the wise-cracks as he takes hit after hit and getting in some of his own. Battered and bloody, Spider-Man soon finds Sandman walking up behind him. He tells Spidey that Hope has three daughters and he has a date with Truth. He hands him the detonator he got from the mayor that controls the remote explosives that are lodged into his and the rest of the Sinister Six's molecular structure.<br/></p> <p>With the Sandman swallowed and the other Sinister Six's in the building, Spider-Man pushes the detonator surrounded by symbiotes. The building explodes.<br/></p> <p>On the streets, J. Jonah Jameson walks past a child. He asks him what it means. Jameson tells him it's a second chance. He is soon on television telling how the streets are no longer safe. There are rapes, mugging, and murder on on every corner once again. The \"super-terrorists\" are loose again. \"God bless 'em.\"</p> <p>As a criminal tries to rob a bar, he is suddenly webbed up from behind and left hanging. A man in a trench coat and hat walks away telling MJ that he will see her once again someday but for now, he has responsibilities.</p>",

As Fury plans to prepare a strike team to follow Reed as soon as someone figures out how to get to that dimension, Spider-Man gets an idea.  Looking at Thor, he figures with Mjolnir, he can open a dimensional portal while the energy trail is still fresh and they can all follow.  Thor opesn a portal and the heroes follow along in the hellicarrier.</p><p>In the other dimension, the government figures it will be possible for others to follow them since Reed was able to send a probe there in the first place.  Hyperion is above the planet monitoring the world for anything out of the ordinary.  In a lab, Reed is trying to figure out what caused all the deaths.  It looks familiar to Reed but he cannot pinpoint it.  He figures the spores must have attached themselves to the probe from one dimenision before it arrived here.  Reed was sure he designed it so that nothing organic could stick to it.</p><p>Just as the hellicarrier is about to arrive, Kitty Pryde is sent by Captain America to find Fury.  As she looks and phases into a room, she overhears part of a conversation between Nick and someone else.  They say that it's important that they find and rescue Reed before he can get his hands on one of the probes.  Nick says after a couple seconds he'd be able to figure it out.  Nick walks Kitty away before she can see who he was talking to.</p><p>Power Princess tries to convince Hyperion that he cannot save everyone and should only save those who will obey him.  Just then, the Ultimates arrive.  Fury orders everyone to stand ready right as Hyperion is headed straight for Thor.</p>",

Lex then gets a phone call about his robotic bat that is trying to infiltrate Batman's \"lair.\" It's attached itself to unidentified aircraft that most likely belongs to Batman.</p><p>At the Batcave, Batman arrives in his new plane. As he goes over the plans of the military command base to try to figure out what Lex is up to, the robotic bat begins to make its move. It works its way to a control pad and types in, \"KILL.\" The bat-plane starts up and fires a missle at Batman and Alfred. Batman falls back into the deep of the cave.</p><p>At the army base, Lex is still pleased with the possibility of what his robotic bat will accomplish. He tells the general that there's been a change in plans. He's taking the base and robots back. He gives a counter-command to the G.I. Robots and gives the command to allow the general just enough time to run out screaming or he will be vaporized.</p><p>Batman survives his fall by falling in twenty feet of bat guano. It literally \"stinks.\" Batman has to use a breathing mask to get away from the smell of ammonia. He can hear the bat-plane still trying to kill any available targets. It seems to have Alfred in its sights. Batman manages to jump onto the plane as it passes by. He accesses the controls and returns it to manual control. Using the plane's sensors, he finds the robotic bat that caused this problem. It's making its way to the batmobile. Alfred simply stomps on it.</p><p>In Gothom, Captain James Gordon is in a patrol car with an officer. For some reason traffic is incredibly backed up. A radio transmission starts up on all channels. It tells them that Democracy isn't working. It goes on and on. Gordon gets out of the squad car and walks up the street. He sees Lex on a jumbotron as he finishes his speech and says he is going to be making some changes.</p>",

The Darkman Vs. the Army of Darkness crossover concludes here as Ash and Darkman fend off not only Deadite Durant and his Deadite guards, but The Deadqueen as well! Will our heroes be able to turn the undead tide in time to save the city... and the world?! The conclusion to this special crossover event is again brought to you by writers Roger Stern and Kurt Busiek, artist James Fry, and cover artists George Pérez and Nick Bradshaw!</em></p><p>Ash, Darkman, and Kelly are headed toward the newly constructed temple of the Deadite. Darkman is hoping to save Julie, his deceased fiancé. Kelly adds that not only will they save Julie, but also the entire city with the incantation they got from the Necronomicon. Ash tries practicing to get the pronounciation correct.</p><p>The recently re-animated Durant tries getting the location of Darkman. After a top mob boss named Barry says tells him he doesn't know, Durant kills him. Barry comes back to life and now serves as one of Durant's chief lieutenants.</p><p>Ash, Darkman, and Kelly try to sneak their way to the top of the temple. They are soon discovered by deadites but are told that they were to take them alive. This allows Darkman and Ash to cut loose. At one point, Darkman's jacket catches on fire. Ash, using his quick thinking and chainsaw, chops off a deadites head and uses the squirting blood as a fire extinguisher. More deadites come to attack.</p><p>Durant tries to cuddle up to Julie, the Queen of Darkness when they are interupted. His men tell him that they have captured Darkman and his two friends. It is soon discovered that the three that have been captured are really fellow deadites. Darkman used his skin/mask tech to cover the deadites' faces. Darkman, now appearing as a deadite, and Ash start a surprise attack as Kelly begins the incantaion.</p><p>The spell is working as the dead return to their dead state. Durant dies...again. The Queen of Darkness seems to be separated from Julie as Darkman catches her unconscious body. The temple begins to self-destruct. Julie is fine and, unfortunately, is reunited with her new boyfriend. Darkman says he's okay with this. She made a new life and he wanted her to return to it.</p><p>As Darkman goes off to sulk on his own. Ash tries to make a move on Kelly. He suggests starting off to get some cheeseburgers since it's been a while since he's had a good on. Kelly notices that he is starting to fade. The spell that brought him there is also being reversed. Ash grabs her and takes a little \"sugar\" from her as he disappears. Darkman and Kelly are left alone.</p>",

The Chinese heroes, the Great Ten are fighting Black Adam. The \"Western\" heroes have been told that stepping on Chinese soil will be regarded as an act of war. J'onn can sense their thoughts as they sit and wait to be allowed to enter. Some are eager to go and get the fight over with. Others question if this will be their time to die. One by one, the Great Ten begin to fall.<br /></p> <p>The heroes talk amongst themselves. Firestorm asks Mr. Terrific if he or Batman could help him find Professor Stein. Hawkgirl mentions that it was Doctor Mid-nite that changed her increased height back to normal. Beast Boy tells Geo-Force that he blames himself for his sister, Terra's, death. J'onn decides it's time for him to appear to his friends.</p> <p>Alan Scott informs everyone that the Chinese government is allowing them to enter China. Black Adam sees them come and welcomes them to meet their end. J'onn sees that in his eyes, there isn't even a single sign of remorse for what he's done.</p> <p>Heroes are injured and knocked out. Black Adam is not holding back. Every punch he throws is meant to kill. As the fight rages on, the Chinese government discusses simply dropping a nuclear bomb on top of them all. The American government has similar ideas. Checkmate meets to discuss what to do if Bialya's neighbors take action.</p> <p>Despite the odds, the heroes continue to fight. Black Adam continues working his way through hero after hero. Witnessing their determination, Martian Manhunter knows it is time for him to act. He grabs Black Adam and blasts him in the face. Black Adam tells J'onn he's fighting on the wrong side. He's been inside of J'onn's mind as he was in his. He says that they are the same, they both lost their entire family. Adam says that humans fear what they can't control and that one day they will come after him. He tells J'onn to stay back. He will not kill him this time because they are alike. If they cross paths again, he will not hesitate.</p> <p>As Alan Scott, Geo-Force, and Natasha Irons all grab Black Adam at once, J'onn enters his mind again. He tells him that this time he will not go any further. He has seen his evil and pain. He asks if he can withstand his own.<br /></p> <p>Black Adam is witness to the deaths of every single loved one and everything's he's known on his planet die. He says what Adam feels as a loss is insignificant compared to what he's felt. J'onn makes Adam feel the deaths of every single one of the million deaths he's caused. He sees what he has become. Adam vows that J'onn has made a mortal enemy and he will break him once more. Captain Marvel arrives just in time to unleash the lightning on Adam.</p> <p>With a big flash of light and smoke, everyone loses sight of where Adam fell. J'onn has changed. He lost the connection to Adam's mind as soon as the lightning struck. He doesn't know if he's still alive or not. J'onn feels that he has both died and been reborn. He will no longer deny who he is, the Manhunter from Mars.</p> <p>Above the Earth in the Monitor satellite, the Monitors note that the war on Earth has ended.

            "description": "<p><em>Will Helmut Zemo survive his time-jump to 1920's Germany -- and a crushing confrontation with his Grandfather and father? And if he does -- how will he ever return to the present when he has been using the blood of the Zemo lineage as his \"temporal anchor?\" There is no Zemo blood in our present day besides Helmut... is there...?</em></p><p>Final issue in this great mini-series.</p><p>Zemo finds himself overlooking his fater's lab with Hitler and some men inside. They bring in a \"patient\" to test out their his father's latest weapon. He sees Hitler's bodyguard and thinks there's something familiar about him but he doesn't recognize him. There is also a civilian scientist there. He is protesting using a human as a test subject for the prototype weapon. Zemo then recognizes him as Dr. Abraham Erskine, the man that created the Super-Soldier Serum and thus \"fathered\" Captain America. Testing the prototype doesn't seem to kill the man. They appear to need more power to completely incinerate him. Erskine asks for a medical kit to see to him. He questions why they need a \"death-ray\" when they could be trying to enhance the human physique. Hitler responds that they do not need to use chemical enhancements because they are born better than others. Zemo thinks how he could simply take care of Erskine now before he is able to escape to the United States to create Captain America. But in doing so, he will never be able to become who he is today.</p><p>After everyone leaves, Zemo checks out his fathers work. He is disappointed at his father's brilliance that is being impeded by his stupidity. Then his father returns, mistaking him for a janitor. Noticing that Zemo was admiring his work, he begins to talk about it. Zemo is reminded of when he was a child and his father would go on and on just to hear himself talk. The sound of his voice was like \"granite laced with confidence.\" He realizes that his has become similar. Now he does not care for the sound of his own voice. He reaches for his gun, reminded of all the rules that were pounded into his head over and over again. His father kept going on about the supremacy of the Aryan race.</p><p>When his father asks him if he agrees, Zemo finds himself saying no. He takes off his mask asking that if he was born looking like that, would that make him inferior. His father is outraged that this man would raise his voice to a Baron and slaps him. Zemo stops him before he can slap him again and follows with a punch to the face. His father calls for the guards. Zemo thinks it would be fitting for him to die here but it is not his time. He throws his mask at his father telling him to keep it as a reminder for the day when others think less of him and hopefully will strive to become something more.</p><p>In the present, Wendell Volker stands in the Zemo estate. He thinks about how he had plans to be a teacher or something more. Those dreams were before he found out about the blood. There was Zemo blood flowing, deluded, through so many all over the world. It is his hope that all the blood he has spilled here will be enough to bring Zemo back. His final act is to cut himself and drip his own blood in the circle of corpses he has made.</p><p>In the past, Zemo is fighting off his father's men. He's not sure if he'll be \"jumping\" out of this time. He wonders what would happen if he jumps and there's no one there for him. Arriving in Castle Zemo, he sees the bodies lying on the floor. Wendell stands behind him with a gun to his head. Wendell tells him that he brought him back with blood, his blood too. Zemo responds that he is disappointed in himself for not seeking out his relatives because he didn't care before. He never understood the importance of family. Zemo asks Wendell if he can change out of the Nazi uniform he is in as he does not wish to die in it.</p><p>Wendell thinks Zemo is mocking him when he mentions being disgusted for having Zemo blood in him. He tells him how he has met every one of his ancestors and has seen all the lies and beliefs he's been fed his entire life. He is ready to die now that he has changed. Wendell is shocked that Zemo would die so easily. Zemo says that if that will pay the price for all that his family has done, he is okay with it. He has tried to be better but doesn't know if trying is enough. By denouncing the blood in him and having saved the world, that shows that he cannot be the horrible man Wendell believes him to be. He tells Wendell the only way to fix things is to let him try. Wendell cannot deal with this and decides to shoot himself. Zemo stops him. He says he does not wish for any more Zemo blood to be spilled in his home. He says it is unfortunate that so many had to die to bring him back. Wendell tells him that there are others out there but Zemo says to leave them be. They do not need to be punished for his sins. Wendell agrees that he needs to be punished too. Zemo will punish himself and Wendell's punishement will be to stand by his side and help him prove his point.</p>",

He tells them that the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55588\" href=\"/necronomicon-ex-mortis/4055-55588/\">Necronomicon</a> will not help. He intends to use science and brute force to show the zombies they are not welcome. Outside, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\" href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\">Goliath</a> is trying to break through their force field. A couple of missiles are launched and explode in <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\" href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\">Bill Foster</a>, putting an end to him.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\">Doom</a> orders <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> to be taken down \"below\" to be locked up with the other uninfected survivors. On a monitor, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\" href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> notices that there are no children or old survivors. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\">Doom</a> says that he has handpicked the survivors and chose ones that are of \"breeding\" age.

She tells him that she excused herself to the bathroom during one of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\">Doom's</a> stories that he's been telling them. They are detected by a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11924\" href=\"/doombots/4005-11924/\">Doombot</a> right away. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> tells <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\" href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> to go back to dinner since he has another idea.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\">Doom</a> is seen walking to his library. He orders his robots to leave him alone. He grabs the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55588\" href=\"/necronomicon-ex-mortis/4055-55588/\">Necronomicon</a>. The book tells <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\">Doom</a> he seems different. That is because it is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> under the armor (from the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11924\" href=\"/doombots/4005-11924/\">Doombot</a>).

The <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55588\" href=\"/necronomicon-ex-mortis/4055-55588/\">Necronomicon</a> tells him that the plague has nothing to do with the supernatural and that it is extraterrestrial (just like <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\">Doom</a> said). The <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55588\" href=\"/necronomicon-ex-mortis/4055-55588/\">Necronomicon</a> tells <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> that it led him to believe that it was supernatural to mess with him. The book wanted <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> to know what it was like to be in a world where there was no hope.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> walks away as the <a data-ref-id=\"4055-55588\" href=\"/necronomicon-ex-mortis/4055-55588/\">Necronomicon</a> continues to laugh at him. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\" href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\">Enchantress</a> calls him over. She is locked behind an energy cage. She tells <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> that she is from another world and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\" href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\">Doom</a> has locked her up because she is a threat to him. He fears her power. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> reveals that he is also from another world and was also locked up, she suggests they team up.

They are shocked and ask <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> what he's done. He tells them there's plenty of him to go around.

            "description": "<p><em>A couple of easy riders head out on the highway! Get ready for the most unlikely team of all so far: Supergirl and Lobo!</em></p><p>Batman and Tharok, now merged into one being thanks to the Haruspex, stand motionless over La Dama as they adjust to their new circumstance. The Tharok side attacks her but Batman resists. Blue Beetle tries to restrain them and has his armor runs scans on them. The armor tells him that both beings are fully there even though only half of each is seen. Before he can learn more, the Fatal Five attack from behind. They demand the Haruspex weapon be turned over to them so they can get it to the Lord of Time. They begin to attack when the weapon isn’t handed over immediately, but, to everyone’s surprise, Validus attacks his own team. Batman explains to Blue Beetle that while he controls Tharok, he controls Validus. Tharok resists Batman’s control and while they have their mental struggle, Blue Beetle takes the Haruspex and tries to look for an “undo” button. Tharok/Batman comes from behind him and tries to take the weapon. Tharok is in control. Blue Beetle does the only thing he can think of and fires the weapon at them again, resulting in Tharok/Batman <em>and</em> the Haruspex weapon to disappear. Over his shoulder, La Dama congratulates him on killing Batman.</p><p>Elsewhere in space, Supergirl and Lobo are having an arm wrestling match in the middle of a bar. Lobo wins and decides to buy drinks for everyone in the room. Supergirl tells him that it’s time to leave but he won’t listen. When one of the patrons takes him up on his offer for drinks, she punches him through a wall, discouraging anyone else from taking up her time. As she and Lobo walk out of the bar they find themselves transported to what looks like a hedge maze. Supergirl tries to get out but when she goes anywhere other than the path she gets transported right back. Lobo takes the lead and uses his tracking abilities to find a way out. When they make it out they are greeted by a man in purple robes. He says he’s the guardian of the Book of Destiny and he needs their help. He tells him the tale of what happened to the Book and they listen. He had once thought that the book contained all that had been or ever would be but one day he found a page that had four men who were not visible to him. Further study showed him that these men who “were not there” were changing things, rewriting reality, all throughout the book. He decided that these men who had caused the damage were the only ones who could fix it so he tried to get it to them. Without the Book the guardian seems to no longer be completely “there”, so he doesn’t remember how the men were supposed to fix it. He <em>does</em> remember though that him passing on the Book gave the Lords of Luck a chance to take it. Supergirl tells him that they <em>did</em> get the book and the guardian tells her that not only must she get it back, she must deliver it to the four men he was talking about. The bad news is, he doesn’t know who they are. The good news is, Batman and Hal Jordan do (or will).</p><p>Supergirl gets Lobo to give he a ride to where they need to go and while they ride, she tries to convince him that she should read it. He says she shouldn’t but she still wants to. When they get to Rann and Lobo kicks her off his bike, she tells him that she <em>let</em> him with the arm wrestling match. He flies off frustrated and unbelieving and when Supergirl flies into Rann airspace, she’s shot at. She looks around to see why and finds Adam Strange and Hal Jordan fighting off hundreds of Thanagarians.</p><p>In an unknown place, Batman/Tharox awakens. The bodies of the Fatal Five are around them and they seem to be in a room with some pretty advanced technology. Before they can really do anything, the Legion of Superheroes appears and tells them they’re on lockdown.</p>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The issue opens with Julie and Johnny in a diner discussing Julie's vast knowledge of burgers from around the world. Johnny asks if Julie's ever bothered by the fact that she doesn't know everything that these alien powers have done to her.</p><p>Julie looks away, lies, and changes the topic of coversation to Phil and his new \"friend.\" Johnny responds with a comment that amounts to \"friend\" being far too generous a title for someone who stabbed Julie, but Julie says she understands that Hollow was just scared and lashed out. Johnny suggests they just call S.H.I.E.L.D. because of all the new laws, but Julie expresses her concern that then they'd just be moving Hollow from one lab to another. She reassures Johnny that Mattie and Mickey are looking into it, as the two of them get into his car.</p><p>Johnny replies that he doesn't trust Mattie, but Julie once again steps in to defend someone from Johnny's skepticism. She turns the topic of conversation to what she sees as a sexual relationship developing between Chris and Mickey. Johnny is skeptical, once again, saying he knows his friend and that Chris would never go out with such a \"goody-goody.\" Julie's skeptical of this, stating that Mickey is totally hot and that Julie herself would totally--but she stops herself there, quickly turning the topic of conversation over to how they need to get to the studio for her audition and her nervousness over it. Johnny wants to know what the rest of Julie's original thought toward Mickey is, but instead expresses his skepticism that a girl who's taken on nearly every bad guy on the planet would be so nervous about one little audition. \"Super villains are easy,\" the former Power Pack \"Lightspeed\" Julie Power retorts.</p><p>Still, Johnny agrees to help her pursue her acting career and reassures her that her dream to be a big star is definitely no secret, so that the two of them should go make her dream a reality. The two of them arrive at Marvel Studios.</p><p>Meanwhile, Phil washes the dishes in his apartment, wondering about Hollow and her secrets as he glances at her sleeping, curled up form laying on his floor by the TV and couch. Though it's been a few weeks since she started staying with him, she's only ever said that one word, \"Like,\" which she said when they met for the first time. Phil imagines the kiss the two shared at their first encounter to be something much more romantic than it had been, a smile on his face.</p><p>He's concerned about all the secrets she's keeping and that concern quickly turns to anguish and fear as he sees an image of the Green Goblin and Hollow, ready to kiss him, in the reflection of one of the plates he's washing. He cries out, \"NOO!\" and knocks the dishes off the counter violently away from himself. Hollow, startled awake by Phil's outburst, comforts him as best she can when she sees that he is in emotional pain.</p><p>Back at Marvel Studios, Julie angrily leaves an audition with the big Hollywood director who's casting for a movie called \"Civil War,\" Johnny in toe. The director told her to get acting lessons, which causes her to launch into an angry tirade in the hallway to Johnny about how that director wouldn't know <b>acting</b> if he had an Oscar shoved up his--but Julie's interrupted by a man who's very impressed with her blunt honesty about Hollywood. Turns out, it's Mark Lowell, one of Johnny's favorite directors.</p><p>Mr. Lowell laments the fact that CGI films are becoming more popular, since he's an old-fashioned action flick director who needs to pay all sorts of costs regarding special training and stuntmen. Julie decides she can help this director out, \"outting\" herself and Johnny as an ex-superheroes. The director agrees to give them jobs as stuntmen, which Julie is totally thrilled about. He does, however, ask them if they are registered with the government regarding their superpowers and status as heroes. Julie hesitates, then says \"yup.\"</p><p>Johnny pulls her aside for a moment, asking her if she really thinks this is a good idea. \"Sure, I mean why not?\" Julie replies, a little miffed. Johnny reminds her how the rest of the group reacted badly to her using her power of flight a few weeks back, but it doesn't deter Julie, who replies that the true purpose of the group is to put their costumed pasts behind them and that's exactly what she's doing by getting this job. Julie turns and shakes the hand of her new boss, while Johnny reluctantly agrees to go along with it.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Griffith Park Obeservatory, Chris begs Mickey to give him another chance, skeptically questioning her on just how many times he has to apologize for becoming Darkhawk again and whether it was really so bad that he did, since he did it for \"the right reasons\" like busting up a MGH facility. Mickey retorts with a snide question of whether Chris thinks his \"good intentions\" justifies him using his powers despite their pledge not to anymore.</p><p>Chris, as carefully as possible, calls her out on this bit of b.s., reminding her that she was the one who convinced all of them, a few months ago, to put on their costumes and go after \"those runaways.\" Mickey angrily reveals that her real problem is with the fact that Chris and Mattie were doing it together, alone, as opposed to when they went after The Runaways and it was a group trip.</p><p>Chris realizes that Mickey is jealous of Chris spending time with Mattie, even though they were just \"on patrol\" as Chris says, and Mickey admits that it's part of the reason why she's so upset. Chris gets angry that Mickey doesn't trust him enough, but Mickey reassures him that she does trust him, it's just that Mattie rubs her the wrong way, in general.</p><p>Chris questions why Mickey doesn't get jealous of the other girl, Julie, and Mickey quickly makes up an excuse about Julie's <b>career</b> obviously being her top priority. Chris tells Mickey that he couldn't care less what Julie's into, because he's into Mickey, not Julie, and the two of them kiss. Afterward, Chris makes a joke about there hopefully being <i>some</i> time it's okay to put costumes on, like, possibly, in the privacy of their own homes. Mickey sees where Chris is going with this and suggests the bedroom. Chris agrees, saying he'd like to see <i>her</i> in spandex.</p><p>Back at Marvel Studios: Cult favorite Mark Lowell's latest action flick is being filmed, with Julie Power as the stuntwoman for the actress playing Black Cat and Johnny Gallo as the stuntman for the actor playing Iron Fist. The two engage in an action sequence which ends with Julie falling to her apparent doom -- which is, of course, just a bit of acting on her part, as she saves herself at the last moment with a rainbow cushion.</p><p>The director and a cameraman are very pleased with all the money they'll be saving by using ex-superheroes, with Mr. Lowell sleazily adding that there'll be some \"fringe benefits\" with his latest \"discovery\" as Julie is lauded by the film crew for her performance. Mr. Lowell ups the compliment ante by saying that she and Johnny are going to be big stars in this town.</p><p>This causes the Julie, the eternal dumb blond as far as Johnny knows, to instantly fly off, shouting \"Woo hoo!\" and claiming she just HAS to go tell her family all about her fame and success. Johnny, meanwhile, is left behind to make excuses to a stunned Mr. Lowell and Mattie, whom he calls and tells her he has to cancel their lunch meeting due to Julie's antics.</p><p>Sitting outside at a table with an umbrella hanging over it, with her laptop in front of her, Mattie is polite enough to Johnny while she's on the phone with him, but calls him an idiot in frustration after she gets off the phone with him. She's looking at a web article whose headline reads \"Costumed Casualty After Manhattan Massacre: Murdered Hero Was ESU Student.\"</p><p>Elsewhere, flying through the skyscrapers of Hollywood in the Black Cat suit, Julie enthusiastically tells her sister Katie about her success, who in turn quickly picks up on the fact that Julie's using her powers because she can hardly hear her over all the wind. Julie lies, claiming she's just driving with the window down, and lands near the Hollywood sign. After a short conversation, Katie expresses her concern that Julie is letting her whole \"dumb blond\" act go to her head. She reminds Julie that Julie is her older sister and that she used to be the smart, responsible one; Katie further wonders when Julie will start acting <i>that</i> part again.</p><p>Later on, Julie is changing back into regular clothes in a trailer when there's a knock at the door. It's Mark Lowell, Mr. Director, wanting to collect on some of those \"fringe benefits\" before and stating how he has the power. Julie decides to show him who really has the power in the trailer and blasts him with a rainbow beam, sending him hurdling out of the trailer. Director Lowell shouts at her that there are laws now to protect people from superpowered freaks like her and suggests he might call the police. Julie replies that he should go ahead and call the police, so that they can explain the laws protecting minors like her from predators like him. Mr. Lowell is shocked to discover that Julie is underage, saying that he assumed--but Julie cuts him off there, saying that he assumed the persona she put on was the <i>real</i> her. Hard to believe it took a dirtbag director like him to realize it, she further states, but she realizes now that it's time to drop the act.</p><p>She returns to the roof she jumped off of a few weeks ago, remembering what she said about being tired of living a lie and wanting to be free. That's still true, but she decides that maybe this time it's time to take a step back and keep her feet on the ground, to see what it's really like living without lies. She turns away and walks over the roof towards the exit, the wind blowing through her hair.</p><p>Later on, at one of the group's regular meetings at Holy Trinity Church, she confesses to the group that she hasn't been honest with them about who she is. She says that she's had to lie about her powers since she was ten, along with the rest of her siblings, and passes around a photograph of herself with Katie, Alex, and Jack Power as little kids. She confesses that maybe she's gotten too used to lying and that it's too easy to lie to herself. She asks them for a new beginning and reintroduces herself once again as Julie Power.</p><p>The others welcome her into the group, ready to give her another chance, but the moment is interrupted by a familiar female voice. She is happy with how they list their meetings online because it's easier for her to find and kill them... and with that Nekra bursts into the room!</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage to the movie poster for <em>Pretty in Pink<strong>.</strong></em></li></ul>",

With <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17820\" href=\"/abbey-chase/4005-17820/\"><i>Abbey Chase</i></a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17825\" href=\"/sydney-savage/4005-17825/\"><i>Sydney Savage</i></a> captured by the mysterious sniper and Arthur Franco, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17807\" href=\"/deuce/4005-17807/\"><i>Deuce</i></a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17826\" href=\"/silicon-valerie/4005-17826/\"><i>Silicon Valerie</i></a> are at a loss. But has Abbey been swayed into joining the other side by the enigmatic sniper who was taking aim at her? Find out in the conclusion to the latest DG epic!</em></p><p>Franco and the sniper have caught Abbey and Sydney and have trapped them in a glass bowl quickly filling up with water. Abbey and Sydney plead for Franco to realise that he is in fact not holding the real master key and very soon they will all be dead. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17806\" href=\"/secret-agent-zero/4005-17806/\">Secret Agent Zero</a>, now disguised as a guard after revealing that he was disguised as the President of the United States, attacks Franco and the girls are freed just before they drown. The sniper is incapacitated, but Franco dies in the fight. It is up to Danger Girl to expose the real mastermind behind these nuclear threats.</p><p>Deducing that they need to find the technician who had since disappeared from Franco's team to get to the real mastermind, Secret Agent Zero disguises himself as Arthur Franco and infiltrates his location. Secret Agent Zero makes him spill everything on his master.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56318\" href=\"/white-house/4020-56318/\">White House</a>, General Wallace is advising the Vice President that Deuce has been unable to complete his mission and the President is in grave danger. Agreeing, the Vice President orders the general to arrest Deuce and the Danger Girl team.</p><p>On the Danger Yacht, Deuce coolly waits for the general, now aware that he is in fact the true mastermind behind the Master Key threats. The general, admitting to all the events up till now, intends to execute Deuce and frame him and Franco for everything, but not before Franco's sniper takes the general out without killing him. The sniper creates a diversion before escaping capture. As the general's men smash through the glass ceiling of the yacht, the actual President makes a timely entrance to save Deuce.</p><p>The general is arrested and given medical treatment. Abbey, gloating, shows the general what she thinks is a safe bomb but is really an armed nuclear bomb intended to kill Franco. Seeing this the general has a heart attack, but Silicon manages to disarm the bomb with but the push of a button on her key chain. It seems she managed to study and replicate the bomb triggers found in the data file stolen by Abbey and Sydney in Madagascar.</p><p>Safe and sound, Sydney and Abbey return to Melbourne, Australia to enjoy Sydney's new home and settle in. Unfortunately, Johnny Barracuda spoils the girls' get-together. The girls kindly let him in but with no intention of letting him have any fun - his job is moving boxes and unpacking while the girls pop open a bottle of champagne.</p>",

She's causing too much trouble for them to overlook, and Red Crow can't stop them from trying to get to Gina. <br /> Meanwhile, Dashiel has been following the extremely promiscuous Carol Ellroy.

Instead the Amazons managed to take out the pilot and the plane crashes when Supergirl can no longer hold it up and they plummet in the a Wisconsin forest.

            "description": "<p>*Mr Mind Makes His Move!</p><p><i>Overview</i></p><p>The final installment of the acclaimed miniseries by Jeff Smith throws the Marvel family against the Monster Society of Evil itself! Their only hope of surviving and saving the world as we know it is that they're too young to realize what they're really up against!</p><p>Captain Marvel (Billy) rushes towards the robots to save Mary after Dr. Sivana kidnapped her. Talky Tawny tries telling him to stop. More monsters are called in to deal with Marvel. Tawny has no choice but to jump in and help. Once the monsters are defeated, they are able to enter on of the robots. Captain Marvel notices a small shaft. He decides to change back to Billy in order to follow Sivana and Mary. Talky quickly warns him not to change. Talky talks Captain Marvel into leaving the robot. He tells him that he cannot use his magic inside the robot. Marvel thought that the wizard said he just couldn't use it at the Rock of Eternity. Talky says that since Mr. Mind came through the Rock, the same rules could apply. Using magic within magic could kill him. Captain Marvel sees no choice. Outside he changes back to Billy. Talky changes into a small cat and they head back to the robot. Before Talky can enter, the door is sealed shut. Billy is on his own.</p><p>Trapped in darkness, Billy makes his way to the shaft. He notices in his pocket he still has the Global Pod from the television station. Suddenly, a bunch of monitors turn on in the shaft with the face of Mr. Mind. Billy demands to know where Mary is and Mr. Mind shows Dr. Sivana dragging a bound and gagged Mary up the shaft. Then Mr. Mind tells Sivana that there is another human on board and he only needs two. Sivana tells Mr. Mind that Billy is not with him and he should get rid of him. Billy doesn't know what to do so he uses the Global pod to call for help.</p><p>Outside, Helen Fidelity tells Mr. Morris (the owner of the station) that she's getting a signal. Billy tells them that Sivana has kidnapped Mary. They need more proof than just his word since Sivana is the Attorney General. Billy tries showing them one of the monitors showing Sivana with Mary on the camera in the Global pod. The transmission is a little fuzzy so they can barely make it out. The station's lawyers strongly advise against any action.</p><p>Inside, all the screens go fuzzy and a new sound begins. All the cockroaches from the city appear to be there. Billy becomes engulfed as Helen asks where Captain Marvel is. He tells her that he's at the foot of the robot with Talky Tawny. Then the signal cuts out so Helen and Mr. Morris decide they need to do something. Again the lawyers advise against it because their insurance wouldn't cover it. As Mr. Morris talks to them, Helen leaves on her own.</p><p>The cockroaches want to crush the \"human\" Billy. One speaks up telling them to wait. He tells them that this human spared his life. Some ants come in and mention that he's spared them too. They begin to discuss that they have been summoned by Mr. Mind to drive machines. Mr. Mind then comes on and tells them to escort Billy to the cockpit.</p><p>Helen is at the base of the robot looking for Talky Tawny and contacts Billy. She then tells him that she is broadcasting live with the Global pod. She asks him to describe his surroundings. He tells her and says that Sivana must not be too far ahead of him. Talky has changed into his old man guise and tells Billy to rescue Mary and get down before the \"Hour of Two Lights\" comes. He tells him to remember the paradox and if he's inside, Captain Marvel will not be able to help them.</p><p>Billy is half listening as he notices that Sivana has reached a hatch at the top. Billy asks the others if they can see Dr. Sivana on top. Mr. Morris orders some cameras into the air to get a better shot. Mr. Mind tells Sivana to put Mary in the cockpit when there is a bright flash of light. It seems the Hour of Two Lights has arrived. The third and final robot has arrived. It is a destroyer and the insects are about to destroy the Earth. Helen and Talky notice more insects heading towards the new robot.</p><p>On top, Sivana calls the military and orders them to stand down. No one will be allowed in the air either. He is about to place Mary in the cockpit when Billy finally reaches the hatch and pushes through. To his surprise, he is on top of the other robot. Sivana is upset to see only one chair in the cockpit. Mr. Mind tells him that he is no longer necessary. The roaches tell Billy to get into the cockpit on his side and they will tell him how to move the robot's arm to save Mary.</p><p>Sivana begins arguing with Mr. Mind. Mr. Mind tells him to throw himself off since he doesn't need him. Angered by this, he decides to throw off Mary instead. On Billy's side, the cockpit begins to wrap tentacles around him and starts strangling him. A laugh begins and Mr. Mind thanks Billy for the use of his nervous system. Sivana then yells for Mr. Mind's attention as he throws Mary off. Talky asks Billy if he can do anything to save her. Billy says, \"Shazam\" and is transformed. Only this time is different. Captain Marvel now stands as tall as the robots. He reaches out a giant hand and safely catches Mary.</p><p>The insects have all entered the destroyer and begin to fight Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel has to be careful not to smash any buildings or people. He puts Mary safely on top of a building and continues to fight. Using all his strength, he punches the destroyer.</p><p>As everyone cheers, Talky is concerned. He says Captain Marvel punched him too hard. The punch has created a black hole and everything is getting sucked back into Eternity, including Captain Marvel. With the robots gone, the bugs and Dr. Sivana find themselves momentarily suspended in the air. Then there is a huge tidal wave of insects. Talky makes his way to Billy and asks him where Mary is. Billy says, \"Shazam\" to transform back in order to get her. The problem is, nothing happens. His powers went back with Mr. Mind and the robots. Dr. Sivana finds a de-powered Billy interesting. Billy tells him he doesn't need powers and begins to thump on Sivana.</p><p>Sivana cries out Uncle but then pulls out a gun on Billy. As he shoots, the bullets are deflected as Mary Marvel arrives. She managed to untie herself. She says since Billy gave her his powers, maybe she can give them back. Now they are both powered up again. As they fly off with Talky Tawny, Dr. Sivana tries shooting at them. The military arrives and arrests him for kidnapping.</p><p>Back at the Rock of Eternity, Billy, Mary, Talky, and Captain Marvel talk to Shazam. It appears that Sivana was the true threat to mankind. He also tells them that now Mr. Mind is connected to him and will most likely be back. Billy realizes he still has the Global pod. Shazam tells him he should return it right away as Mr. Morris will want to talk to him.</p><p>At the station, Mr. Morris offers Billy a job working with Helen. He is now part of the WHIZ family. Billy is happy to finally have a family to belong to.</p><p><i>The Beginning...</i></p>",

Strange says that she left to go fight demons in the dark dimension she thought that that was better than being married and a protege to Dr Strange.</p><p>Then Iron man comes in and is told about Clea, he answers with saying that he's sorry and she was very attractive which ticks off Strange. Then Black Bolt and Charles enter and they start talking about how Charles dated outside the species.</p><p>Iron man says that they don't know how lucky you married guys are, he's putting to much energy into finding someone to be with. Charles says that Black Bolt is laughing in his mind saying that Medusa never lets him get a word in. Reed then cuts in saying that Sue is great but when he's not there at the right time she just leaves the mansion. Iron man asks where she goes and Reed says that he knows where she goes with Namor standing behind them. He says that Reed keeps his wife in a cage. He says that they met dated a little and then he gave her powers and she was forced to live in Reeds tower, he then says that she loves and she's not going to leave him, he says that he's tried. He tells Reed that he needs to devout part of everyday to his wife and children.</p><p>They start to get annoyed of this conversation when Iron man says that he slept with Madame Masque, the rest don't know who she is and Iron man says that they should move on.</p><p>A kree named Noh-Varr (Marvel Boy) has declared war on earth and right now he's imprisoned and there is a major fear of escape and also they think that the imprisonment of Noh-Varr would anger the Kree empire. Iron man says that they should use Charles to change Noh-Varr's mind. Charles says no because eventually he would figure out that something is wrong about his decision and also there is a major molar line that they could never come back from. Namor comes up with a suggestion that they should talk in his language, violence.</p><p>Namor appears out of nowhere in Noh's cell and says to stand. Noh says for Namor to put some pants on, Namor then beats Noh's head into the ground. Namor says that when he declared war on Earth he declared war on the atlanteans. Namor then continues to beat him up until Noh gets up in Attilan which he seemed to figure out that it's one of Charles's illusions. Charles admits to this but tells Noh that the Kree had a vision for earth and they wanted earth to be protected so they could reach those visions. Then Black Bolt talks and says that when the Inhumans are of Kree descent and when you declare war on earth you declare war on himself. Then it's back to his cell where Namor tells him that he's an immature brat. Namor continues to beat up Noh which ends in another illusion but this time it's with Reed who explains to Noh-Varr about Captain Marvel who wanted to protect earth trying to tell him that this is who he could be, a hero to the earthlings.</p><p>Then it's Iron man's turn who says that earth will evolve into something great you just need to give it a chance to evolve. They tell him that he can either be the next captain Marvel or he could live the rest of his life in jail. They tell him to earn his way out to freedom and that's when they leave him. It skips to Reed at home sitting next to his sleeping son Franklin Richards when Sue enters and Reed asks if tomorrow she would like to go on a date and a family picnic. Then it cuts to Iron man and Strange at their homes looking very depressed out of something said today.</p><p>The issue ends with Noh-Varr in his cell saying Captain Marvel.</p>",

The League of Assassins makes their move to kidnap Black Canary's young charge, Sin... only to have Green Arrow thwart their plan in a way that devastates Dinah — and may affect her response to Oliver's proposal.</p> <p><b><i>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead</i></b></p> <p>At Star City Harbor, Black Canary questions Green Arrow on what he has done. One of henchmen answer that for him, saying that he has destroyed the future of the League of Assassins. Black Canary, angered by this uses her Canary Cry in a rage, pushing everyone back. </p> <p>At Star City Docks, Merlyn stops at a boat with two police officers guarding it. He shoots the both of them and steals the boat.</p> <p>Black Canary takes down the henchmen when Merlyn finds Sin's shirt floating in the water. Green Arrow tells Mia to find Connor, and Green Arrow readies an arrow, when he finds a black arrow positioned where his own arrow was on the bow. Merlyn asks the henchmen what happened to Sin, when one of them says that they didn't kill her. Merlyn kills him, calling him a liar when the others tell Merlyn that he wasn't lying at all. Merlyn then points his bow and arrow towards Green Arrow when Black Canary flies in, kicking Merlyn. Black Canary snaps Merlyn's bow, and he uses the string from the bow to strangle Black Canary. Merlyn continues to strangle Black Canary, but finds it isn't working. The string eventually snaps and breaks Merlyn's forearms by a karate chop. Green Arrow tells Black Canary to calm down and tells her that Merlyn won't be able to suffer if he's dead.</p> <p>Later, at Black Canary's house, she has it all packed up and looks at the wedding ring and throws it away. Green Arrow comes in and tells Merlyn he's in jail for life after he killed the two officers. Black Canary doesn't care and tells him to get out, but not before reading a letter... from Sin! In the letter, Black Canary reads that her death was faked. The shirt she saw floating in the sea was just another shirt of hers that was ripped up. She ended up swinging into the porthole of the ship and escaping there, where she met Connor at a building, where she has a new teacher now. Black Canary cries and shows Ollie the wedding ring. She tells him that he had been selfish about himself, and had hurt her in the process, but as for the wedding proposal... she accepts.</p>",

Teen's body is far more resilient and she lifts the concrete easily and walks out unharmed.</p><p>Bomb kep beating Teen with apparent ease all the while describing how she knows about Teen's powers and backers and that 5minutes earlier she had Red Cross launched the nuke at the Shadow government base where the men behind the plot are and the machines that are giving Teen her powers are.</p><p>As Teen starts to die, no longer able to heal, bomb plucks out her right eye and Teen asks Bomb if she ever wondered why she has no memory of her childhood or past, how she can regenerate and explosions do no damage to her. She wonders if Bomb shouldn't take some of her DNA for use in the future.</p><p>Returning home Bomb is drunk and finds Red Cross in the ruins of her home with her computer wrecked and Ashe's body dashed on the floor. They talk and Cross tell Bomb she will leave her alone until the innocents of the city have been saved and that Bomb has an important role in this town but once the innocents are gone she's coming back to finish her off.</p>",

Zenn-La, the planet of his birth, the planet he saved through his own sacrifice -- the Silver Surfer crossed the galaxy to draw his last breath here.</p><p>He’s home.</p><p>What waits for him?</p><p>Norrin is traveling home, back to Zenn-La. He needs to go back home to spend his remaining time there. He is speeding through the cosmos, he is very weak. He is so weak that he crashes instead of lands when he arrives. Once he falls through the atmosphere, he awakes to Shalla Ball holding him. She is trying to take care of him, but begins to cry. After a few days, the leading scientists of Zenn-La declare their top science can do nothing to aid Norrin. Shalla Ball is desperate to save him, she even wants to give back her portion of the Power Cosmic given to her, something that could possibly kill her. However, Norrin convinces her not to, stating do not regret my death, for I have never regretted anything I have done for you and our people. Norrin was layed out on a bed to spend his remaining time. People from all over Zenn-La came to show their thanks for what the Surfer has done for them. As they touched his hand, they each were bestowed with something that came to be known as the \"Mark of Norrin.\" Whenever anger, violence, or hatred came into the thoughts of the people of Zenn-La, the mark would begin to change colors and remind the people of the sacrifice and many great deeds Norrin did for them. As Norrin is lying on his death bed, he spots Galactus' ship descending upon the planet. He screams out in horror, claiming since that he gave his life to protect Zenn-La, Galactus must have came back now that Norrin is dying to claim Zenn-La once again. Norrin staggers to his feet, marching toward Galactus to fend him off yet again. Galactus greets Norrin and lifts him to eye level with him. Galactus actually trys to heal Norrin, unfortunately to no avail. He then discounts that he is present to devour the planet, rather he came to show his appreciation to the Surfer, the most honorable being he has ever known. He declares that Norrin should let go of the pains of flesh and be at peace. Galactus remained on Zenn-La for the entire three day funeral ceremonies. Soon after, Norrin passes away peacefully, with Shalla Bal by his side. Shalla Bal requests a favor from Galactus and he humbly accepts. Galactus takes the body of Norrin and forms a star from his remains as a reminder in the night sky of the Silver Surfer.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>You've never seen a Cinderella story like this one! In search of a husband for Princess Gwendolyn, a costume ball is thrown for the suitable young men of the Kingdom, but when the mysterious Spider Prince arrives, that's when the trouble begins. Who is this noble knight no one has ever heard of? What grudge do the soldiers in the Goblin Brigade hold against him? And just why does this dashing Spider Prince need to depart before midnight? Will he fall victim to a pumpkin bomb?</em></p><p>Once upon a time, a family of knights fought bravely. This family was the Parkers. During one battle, Ben Parker was stabbed by a sword. His brother Richard tried to go to him, only to get shot numerous times by arrows. With both Parkers dying, Richard was concerned with who would raise his son, Peter and be a mentor to him. Another knight was near by, Norman Osborn. Even though many felt Osborn was a demon, Richard felt he was an honorable man. With his dying breath, he asked Norman if he would raise his son. Norman promised that Peter would always have a place in his home.</p><p>Years later, it is seen that Peter's place is basically that of a servant. Using a broom, Peter would practice being a knight in private. He wishes he could get out of the Osborn house and that his father and uncle were still alive. His only true friend is a fellow servant, Mary Jane.</p><p>As Peter and Mary Jane talk, an enraged Norman storms in demanding that Mary Jane polish his and Harry's armor until she can see her reflection in them. He says that Harry's big day is coming and he has to look his best. Mary Jane is sad because she already has so much other work to do. Peter, being the friend that he is, offers to help her polish them.</p><p>Peter soon finds out why the knights hate polishing their own armor. He also finds out that the King is having a ball next Saturday. He has decided it is time that Princess Gwendolyn finds a suitable knight to marry her. Norman wants nothing else but for Harry to be the chosen one. Peter is ecstatic to hear about the ball. He figures this is his chance to be with Gwen. He asks Mary Jane if she knows of any way to get him in. She refuses, not wanting to get into any further trouble. Peter continues to beg her asking how would he ever get another chance to meet the perfect girl.</p><p>Visiting his father's and uncle's tomb down below, he ponders over how he can fulfill his dreams. Seeing a spider spinning a web between the two tombs, Peter decides to create his own armor. He works hard creating an armor with the symbol of a spider.</p><p>The night of the ball, Norman tells Peter that he has given the staff the night off except for him. Peter has to pick up the slack and is ordered to clean out the stables before they return at midnight. Saddened over losing his opportunity to secretly go to the ball, it is now Mary Jane's turn to come to his rescue. She offers to work the stable so he can join the rest of the staff and get his mind off of Gwen.</p><p>At the palace, Gwen is not happy with her father. She is not too keen on the same old crowd being at the ball. She doesn't think it's possible for her true love to simply walk through the front door. At that exact moment, the \"Prince of Arachne\" is announced. Peter walks straight for Gwen, much to Norman's dismay.</p><p>Kneeling before Princess Gwen, Peter introduces himself. She asks for him to remove his helmet but tells her that the laws of his land prohibit him from doing so until he shares a dance with the woman asking. Charmed, they soon hit the dance floor.</p><p>Hours pass and Peter soon discovers that midnight is approaching. Having no choice, Peter must flee immediately. Gwen tries to stop him since she doesn't even know his name. All she manages to get is one of his webbed brassards.</p><p>A royal decree goes out requesting any information on he who has the matching brassard. Norman sees this as an opportunity for Harry to still marry Gwen. He figures they need to find and kill the real person so that Harry can stand in his place. Peter overhears this entire conversation.</p><p>In Peter's room, Mary Jane decides to help him clean the place up. Seeing something hiding in his mattress, she uncovers his spider-armor. She now knows that he is the one that the King is searching for. Peter walks in and says he needs to destroy the armor. Mary Jane tells him this is his chance. The princess fell in love with him so he needs to go to her. Peter says it's impossible since he's not even a real knight. Mary Jane says it doesn't matter. If Gwen found out the truth, she'd just fall in love with him all over again.</p><p>Now seeing that Mary Jane must have some sort of feelings for him, they are interrupted by Harry. He takes the piece of armor and says Peter will suffer his father's wraith when he finds out. Mary Jane tells Peter to quickly go to the Princess before Harry can get there. He has to be a knight and save the Princess.</p><p>Harry and Norman arrive only to find that Peter has beat them there and told them the truth. The King has decided to allow Gwen to choose Peter, despite whatever his story was. Norman will not stand for this and raises his sword to strike him. Peter manages to block Osborn's sword with on of his own. The two begin to fight as the King orders his men to stop Osborn. Norman tries striking Peter but he manages to duck the blow. The blade then cuts a rope holding up a chandelier. The chandelier is about to land on Peter but Gwen manages to push him away. Norman stands in shock over having killed the Princess.</p><p>Outraged, Peter approaches Norman and tells him that he's suffered his whole life because of him. It ends now. Norma lies dead also. Harry screams vengeance against Parker.</p><p>The entire kingdom mourns the loss of their Princess. It is accepted that she had chosen to marry Peter and he is allowed to become their new Prince. He is knighted and the spider becomes a symbol of honor and justice. Peter stands over the people, still feeling sadness. Little did he realize that Gwen was not the only love that Peter lost. Mary Jane lies alone with Peter's brassard, dreaming of her knight in shining armor.</p>",

It then pans to a mixture of the Justice league and Justice Society as well as the mention holding up his body parts and saying “it’s done”</p><p>The setting changes from the dream to the bloody outside. Black Adam it laying with a wound on his side and bleeding out. A couple of men standing with guns trained on him. The waking Adam whispers the magic word. “Isis” The two take off running and of course discharging their weapons into Black Adam. Unaffected by the bullets Black Adam speeds forward and cuts the two men in half before leaving the area. In a far off room it shows that Atom Smasher has his wife’s finger and her wedding ring.</p><p>Black Adam lands in Taholah Washington at an animal hospital. There he is nursed back to health. During the black out of the operation. They go to Felix Faust who speaks of Black Adam changing things with what he is doing speaking to the body of Isis. They also show a military man who is in charge of the people hunting Black Adam, they are not happy at the lack of success that has befallen them. At the hospital, the female doctor explains that she would not risk the life of her family and friends or town knowing the history of Black Adam. They then ask him to leave given him some clothes and sending him off. As Adam searches for the magic word while leaving in his rear view mirror he sends the group attacking the hospital.</p><p>Black Adam changes again and holds up two of the attackers breaking their spine. Another one has his arm ripped off and himself shoved into the roof. Taking the last two up into the air he demands that they tell him what is going on. They refuse and he calls magic lightning down to kill one of them. The other being is afraid amd tells him of the use of uranium bullets so that the organization can track him. Black Adam then ascends upwards toward space.</p><p>At the hospital the two doctors that had been saved by Black Adam tell the Justice League that he saved them. In the Brownstone headquarters of the Justice Society Mister Terrific watches a monitor as Black Adam goes up toward the satellite. As Black Adam goes up the man still with him turns to ice and shatters as Black Adam talks to the Justice Society of America. “Consider your tracking abilities of me to be temporarily suspended. Black Adam out.” This is the end of Book 4 of 6.</p>",

The Flash asks what that beeping is, and Rip tells him its locked on Supernova's location the Flash offers to help but Rip turns him down. But he insists and they head off to General City the Flash's hometown. The land a few years before the Flash museum is built, and the Flash says he has a strange case of deja-vu. Suddenly they are all hit with a blast of light form a time sphere, and Supernova, and Rex-Hunter step out of it. Booster asks Rip if its his relative but he says his name is actually Jason Goldstein a completely irresponsible time master who tried to change history by pushing a ten year old Lex Luthor into an oncoming train. Kid Flash asks why he is trying to destroy the Justice League and he says so he, and Supernova will be the greatest heroes the world will ever know. Kid Flash, and Flash attack them but they disappear. Rex says that they have been erased form existence, and that Batman is next. Booster begins to fight Supernova and he asks who he is under that mask Supernova says if he ever found out he would be very surprised. Just then Skeets comes to help Michale only to be stopped by Maximillion a later version of the security android. We are then brought to the house of Daniel Carter who tells Rose that he is the real Booster Gold, when she find one in his closet. We are now take to Hub City years ago where the original Blue Beetle is fighting a mummy when a time sphere light flashes and a figure tells him that in order to save the Blue Beetle he must come with him. We now flash back to where Booster and Rip are fighting. Rex is talking to Rip when Booster throws Supernova at Rex. Booster peers onto a building and says that he thinks the lighting rod is not supposed to be there, and Rip tells him to go take it down. Just then Supernova shoots Booster in the arm. Rip sends a message to Skeets who is fighting Maximillion to help Booster take the rod down but Skeets tells him its easier said than done. Rip takes off his coat, and punches Rex he tells him that his ass is his. Booster and Supernova are still fighting when Booster grabs Supernova's mask and discovers that it is his dad. Rip is beating up Rex when Rex starts to win but when he mentions Rip's girlfriend Bonnie Rip lays him out. Booster and his dad are talking Supernova offers him guidance but Booster refuses and flies towards the pole but his dad grabs his foot. Just then Skeets flies into Booster's dad only to be shot at by Maximillion but leaving just enough time for Booster to grab the lighting rod. Supernova insults Booster and Booster throws him into lighting where he is sent back in time and we see Barry Allen become the Flash. Kid Flash, and The Flash reappear and Booster demands that they go rescue Blue Beetle Rip says that fist he must rescue the woman Ted Kord loved Bat Girl!</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview:</i></p><p><i>It's super-powered space warfare as Polaris leads the Starjammers and the Imperial Guard into battle, while Havok and Vulcan face off against a villain who is way out of their league. And will Marvel Girl's personal vendetta against the Shi'Ar cause her to do the unthinkable? It's the penultimate chapter as the situation goes from “horrible” to “end of all that is.”</i></p><p><b>Issue Summary:</b></p><p><i>“The World,” home of the M’Kraan Crystal.</i></p><p><i>Now…</i></p><p>As a fleet of Scy’ar Tal ships approach the planet, their command – the Eldest – observes everything. He recalls he has longed for the darkness, all these centuries, so he could gaze upon the Godstone. And now, finally to return… it is righteous. “My brothers,” the Eldest proclaims proudly, “we are home,”</p><p>Flanking their leader, one of the soldiers informs the Eldest that the Shi’ar are coming. They intend to fight. “Good,” the Eldest coldly, his teeth bared for combat.</p><p><i>The wing of K’ythri,</i></p><p><i>Major-General Ka’ardum’s battlecruiser…</i></p><p>Araki declares to Lilandra and Ka’ardum that their enemies have to die. Lilandra warns the traitor to be quiet. It is foul enough that his presence there is a concession to a madman and, if Araki had any honor, he would end his own life for acting against his empress. Araki realizes Lilandra still doesn’t understand. These heretics, he says, these Scy’ar Tal… they threaten the entire fabric of the Shi’ar civilization. Lilandra points out that nobody hates the Scy’ar Tal more than she does, but they are there to prevent them from taking the Crystal while the Starjammers destroy the Scy’ar Tal’s star weapon. She will show the Scy’ar Tal the error of their ways and make them admit the truth… but she <i>will not</i> exterminate a species.</p><p>Araki mocks this was the reason why Lilandra was a weak ruler. Because she isn’t willing to do what must be done, even though she knows it is right. He wants the Scy’ar Tal to die. That is what <i>the Shi’ar people</i> want. But he thinks Lilandra is so removed from her people that she doesn’t see it.</p><p>“Enough,” Ka’ardum shouts. The end is beginning. He suggests they pray that Havok makes sure it won’t be their end. Now addressing all Shi’ar ships, he orders all ships to open fire. As the attack rages, one soldier calls to the Eldest. Misinterpreting the interruption, the Eldest calls for silence, reminding his soldier that their brothers die to make the Shi’ar pay, and they must honor that. However, the soldier clarifies, explaining that he has received a distress call from the Finality. Surprised, the Eldest orders to be shown and, a moment later a hologram of a panicked soldier appears. The soldier warns the Eldest that they are under attack and that Finality has been discovered. The Eldest asks the soldier by whom they are under attack, believing it’s the Shi’ar. “No,” the soldier corrects. It’s… <i>the Starjammers!</i></p><p>Protected by an immense, green, magnetic force field created by Polaris, the Starjammers’ ship flies through the Scy’ar Tal’s fleet, destroying all in its path. “Perhaps not the most subtle strategy,” Ch’od jokes while standing next to a concentrating Lorna. He also mocks it’s lucky they are incredibly outnumbered.</p><p>Raza rather enjoys all the damage they are causing. He jokes that Ch’od is getting soft. Raza also thinks Hepzibah is probably sorry she is missing all this. He only wishes they were killing the Shi’ar. Present company excluded, of course, as Raza refers to Korvus. As he sits behind the control panels of the ship, Korvus thanks Raza for the kind compliment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rachel is using her telepathic powers, a blue Phoenix symbol dancing across her right eye while he does. She reads that two ships are approaching starboard… one more under them. She explains that the M’Kraan have been guarding the Fatality station for over a hundred years. Behind them, three more ships are coming in. The Imperial Guard are engaging them, but they can’t keep this up for long. Nearby, Lorna replies that they’ll hold up for as long as they have to. People are depending on them. Namely Alex and… Emperor Vulcan.</p><p><i>Outside, near the Finality station…</i></p><p>Outside, in the vacuum of space, Vulcan flies past all the ships and explosions and makes his way to the Finality station. There, he fires a blast through a wall of the station to get inside. Havok, wearing a protective air helmet and sitting in a small spaceship, follows his brother inside. Once the station has repaired the full breach with emergency force fields and has restored the atmosphere, Alex gets out of his ship, reminding Gabriel that they’ll only disable the weapon and then get back to the fleet, because they can’t hold out for long.</p><p>As he fires a blast at approaching Scy’ar Tal soldiers, killing them all, Vulcan mocks Alex for being boring. He doesn’t think it’s enough to destroy the weapon… the Scy’ar Tal have to know. They have to see the bodies. They have to be <i>afraid</i>. As he also fights some soldiers, Alex replies that they are there to save lives, not play games. Gabriel looks at his brother and quips that they are actually working together, like X-Men. “The professor would be so proud,” he mocks. But he agrees with Alex: no games. That’s for later. The games are for when he will kill Havok.</p><p>With their opponents subdued, Vulcan grabs one by its throat and demands to be informed about Finality. Barely paying attention, Havok instead remarks at the heat. Even with the force fields, it’s like they’re standing on the surface of the sun. He asks Rachel if she’s reading him and explains they’re on the main deck and are proceeding to the core. Meanwhile, the alien finally begins to talk and calls Vulcan a pretender, promising that his end is near. “<i>He</i>” is near, the alien continues… the Eldest is coming for Vulcan. “Oh, hell,” a panicking Alex utters, realizing what’s about to happen.</p><p>A moment later, a teleportation portal opens, crackling with electrical energy. The Eldest and two of his guards have arrived. <i>“The not-Shi’ar brothers,”</i> the Eldest says upon noticing Alex and Gabriel. He is pleased that they have come together, as this way they will not die alone. The Eldest swears they won’t stop from taking the Shi’ar like they took the M’Kraan Crystal from them. He then indicates the brothers to prepare themselves.</p><p><i>Outside…</i></p><p>The battle has finally taken its toll on Rachel, who worries that there are too many to keep track of. Polaris, however, replies that Rachel’s doing a good job. Unfortunately, Rachel disagrees, announcing that they’re coming around again. She can’t…</p><p>On that moment, Gladiator flies through the approaching enemy ship and destroys it. Inside the Guardman’s ship, Oracle grins and thinks the Starjammers should thank them. Nightshade, however, believes the “Earther mutants” should die in fire. Ignoring the statement, Oracle “translates” to Marvel Girl that Nightshade wants her to tell her that the Imperial Guard would hate to see them come to any harm, as they are their newest valued allies.</p><p>Rachel reports to Lorna that Oracle is still blocking her, disabling her to read the minds of both Vulcan and the Imperial Guard. She’s sure they’ve got something planned but can’t figure out what. Lorna agrees, suggesting that they’ll just have to be ready for that. She then instructs Rachel stay in contact with Alex, then tell the guard to… Rachel interrupts, suddenly detecting something troubling. The Eldest has there, she replies. “Okay, plan “A” is over,” Lorna sighs. She orders Ch’od to get them out of there… now!</p><p>Havok and Vulcan combine their blasts on the Eldest, who screams. A moment later, however, the Eldest defends himself and fires a blast against Vulcan himself. Alex screams via his com at Rachel, wants her to tell Lorna not to come here. He then tells Vulcan to contact the Imperial Guard so they can blow up this station. As the Eldest grabs Alex by his throat, Vulcan, having recovered from the earlier blast, refuses to let the Guard do that while he’s still in the station. However, he does contact the Guard so they can come to his aid.</p><p>Knowing what’s coming, the Eldest then throws Alex against his brother, just a moment before the arrival of the Imperial Guard, ready to protect their Emperor. “More alien puppets,” the Eldest laughs. He wonders if the M’Kraan are the only free people left in this universe. He informs the Guard that, though the end of the Shi’ar is near, they don’t have to be with them. Gladiator punches the Eldest and proudly answers the members of the Guard are Shi’ar by their actions. And the Empire will <i>not</i>fall while the Imperial Guard stands!</p><p>In response, the Eldest releases a fire blast against Gladiator, calling him foolish for defending the ones who enslave them. To this, he adds that the end has come for the Shi’ar and all who stand with them! Annoyed by the Eldest’s constant ranting, Vulcan wishes someone would cut out his tongue. Alex tells Vulcan to shut up, as he just noticed something. The other Scy’ar Tal aren’t fighting anymore, while their Eldest battles the Imperial Guard. They aren’t even watching?!</p><p>After the Eldest punches through the armor of Warstar, screaming in his victory, Alex thinks he knows what’s going on. But before he can warn his brother, Vulcan and Gladiator have already started shooting at the Eldest. Havok warns that they need to work together. They need to attack as one at the same points. They have to try to overload the Eldest.</p><p><i>Elsewhere…</i></p><p>Jahf is standing in front of the M’Kraan Crystal, somewhere on an isolated rock in space. He watches the battle around him, while the Shi’ar do their best to prevent the Crystal from coming to any harm.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ka’ardum is sitting in one of the Sh’iar ships and asks for a status report. A pilot reports that their fleet has a seventeen percent of casualties, while the Scy’ar Tal only have four. On that moment, the Scy’ar Tal fire a huge blast through one Shi’ar ship. The pilot panics and informs Ka’ardum that the Eternal Raptor is gone. Nevertheless, Ka’ardum refuses to give up and orders the fleet to continue engaging their enemies. When Lilandra then asks her uncle what’s happening, he replies that he fears that the Shi’ar are being defeated.</p><p><i>Finality…</i></p><p>The Eldest grabs the throat of Gladiator, who screams. Alex warns Vulcan not to let up. After awhile, the Eldest finally gives up and falls on the ground. They’ve done it, Gladiator states, returning to his feet. The Eldest is finished. “That’s what he gets for touching me,” Vulcan coldly replies. “That’s what they all get.” Alex, however, corrects that it isn’t over yet.</p><p>The other Scy’ar Tal all gather around their leader, and repeatedly say his name. The Eldest rises, absorbing energy emanating from his people, until he is restored. “You seek to break our brotherhood, puppets?” the Eldest mocks. The M’Kraan cannot be broken. The end cannot be stopped. They will have what is theirs.</p><p>Incredulous, Vulcan can’t believe this is happening. “And the Shi’ar will pay,” the Eldest screams as he launches another attack. He scratches Vulcan across his back and fires powerful blasts against Gladiator. Turning the Eldest on the defensive, Havok fires his powers and shouts at Gladiator and Vulcan to get up. Meanwhile, as before, the other Scy’ar Tal again don’t interfere while their leader fights.</p><p>Nearly out of breath, Vulcan tells Havok to kill this thing. Havok, however, still firing at the Eldest, tells Gabriel to stop – and look at their opponent. He tells Gabriel to use his power to observe the other Scy’ar. Alex believes they are helping the Eldest somehow. Can Gabriel feel any energy. If he can feel… Gabriel interrupts Alex because he’s doing so. As the Eldest overpowers Alex, Vulcan now sees what’s going on. He sees the Scy’ar Tal extending their arms while the Eldest fights, energy flowing from them to him.</p><p>Grinning from the realization, Vulcan quips that the Eldest takes his power from his people. Maybe his entire species. “Let’s see what we can do about that,” Vulcan smiles. He attacks the Eldest again, this time with different energy. The Eldest in turn screams, followed by the other Scy’ar Tal. Falling to his knees, the Eldest asks what Vulcan has done to him. He cannot feel his brothers! One of the Scy’ar Tal is confused and asks the Eldest what is happening. What should they do? Is… is he the Eldest? “Not anymore,” Vulcan smiles, flames dancing from his clenched fist.</p><p>Back on his comm. Alex contacts Rachel again for a status report. Rachel asks Alex what he just did because it seems like the Scy’ar Tal have lost communications. They’re still fighting, but it’s like they don’t know what they’re doing anymore. Lorna informs Ka’ardum about the situation through their communicators. Ka’ardum explains they’re having the same situation. Whatever Vulcan and Havok just did, it turned the tide of the battle.</p><p>Rachel begins to wonder if they just won, but then trails… until she begins to scream Alex’s name. She has lost contact with Alex! Lorna orders Ch’od to teleport Alex out of there. Ch’od tries but something is jamming their sensors and he can’t get a lock. Lorna believes that means Vulcan is making his move. They have to go down there right away. Ch’od informs Lorna they’ve got a new situation: Flashfire, Mantis, Plutonia and Electron are underway to attack them. Perhaps Alex needs to be rescuing <i>them</i>?</p><p>On the station, Havok suggests to the Eldest a peace offer. He wants the Eldest to call off all of his people. If the Shi’ar truly took the M’Kraan Crystal from him, perhaps they can work something out. To this, Vulcan mocks that the Crystal was never theirs, and that the Scy’ar Tal homes were actually destroyed by artificial moons. He read the file. The M’Kraan did find the Crystal, but so did the Shi’ar. They just weren’t strong enough to keep it. But he is.</p><p>In demonstration, Vulcan fires a blast against the Scy’ar Tal soldier and the Eldest, redcing them to bones and ash. Incensed, Havok pushes his brother against a wall to stop him. “I took care of that myself,” Gabriel smiles pleased with himself. “See you in hell, Alex”. Havok fires a blast at Havok, pushing him through a window of the station, plummeting to the planet below them.</p><p>Titan, Starbolt, Warstar and Gladiator gather around their Emperor, and Vulcan watches his brother falls. Now, Vulcan states, he wants to show the Scy’ar Tal with whom they messed. It’s time they are shown what “finality” really means.</p>",

Not only does it comprise the super-exciting \"Mr. V\" story line, with the usual gun-and-auto action and and special plot twist, but for extra punch, creator Kenichi Sonoda added a bunch of exclusive gag strips and a few issues of his left-to-right reading Riding Bean stories from way back in 1989. Also included are some \"making of Riding Bean\" comics and sketches and notes from the early days. See the beginnings of Sonoda's awesome Gunsmith Cats series!</i></p>",
