Long ago, in the deepest dark of The Black Forest, two brothers – Peter Piper and his older brother Max - encountered ominous forces that changed them both irreparably. Thus begins an epic tale of sibling rivalry, magic, music and revenge that spans medieval times to the present day, when their deadly conflict surfaces in the placid calm of modern day Fabletown. PETER and MAX: A FABLES NOVEL features the deft prose of award-winning comic book writer Bill Willingham and lush ink spot illustrations from FABLES artist Steve Leialoha. The novel also reveals secrets of some of the regular FABLES series cast members including Bigby Wolf, Frau Totenkinder and Bo Peep. Included as well is an 8-page bonus sequential comic story by Willingham and Leialoha that serves as a bridge to the FABLES graphic novel collections. And don't miss the special FABLES #1/PETER and MAX PREVIEW on sale in July!</i></p>",

Joined by the best of the best – Scott Williams – on inks, this new series is sure to be on everyone's must-read pile! Delving into the more supernatural and esoteric areas of Gotham City, the 6-part storyline explores the horrific murder of one of Bruce Wayne's childhood friends…and the terrible ramifications the brutal crime has on Batman's life!</i></p><p>Batman is searching for his childhood friend, Dawn Golden, who recently had gone missing.</p><p>During their childhood, Bruce thought Dawn was cold and aloof. However, as time passed, the two became very close friends.</p><p>In the present, Commissioner Gordon is coordinating the search for Dawn at the police station.</p><p>Killer Croc has just beaten up a man in another part of the city. Batman tracks him down, having figured out that Croc has taken Venom. Batman believes that Croc is involved in Dawn's sudden disappearance. The two begin two fight, and Croc gains the upper hand. Batman throws a large shard of glass over Croc, defeating him. As Batman interrogates him, Croc confesses that he gave Dawn to a man named Lars Beck. Batman then hands Croc over to the police and asks Gordon for information about Beck. Gordon tells Batman that Beck has taken on several aliases, such as Lars Becker or Larry Booker. Beck has been working in a new club called the Boom Room. Batman then leaves as several reporters surround Gordon.</p><p>At the Narrows, a few hobos find a dismembered corpse.</p><p>At the Batcave, Bruce investigates Dawn's disappearance. He goes to investigate the Boom Room to see any links between Beck and Dawn. At the Boom Room, Batman finds a necklace similar to the one worn by Dawn. Outside, the Batmobile is hacked by an unidentified person. Suddenly, Batman is attacked by the Penguin and his thugs.</p>",

Then he comes to a shocking realization-this woman is Ella, his plain and unassuming housekeeper! Taking his ugly-duckling-turned-swan housekeeper out to dinner, he finds himself becoming increasingly attracted to her as they spend more time together. Not only is this new Ella (having put aside her dowdy housekeeper's uniform) gorgeous, she's considerate and honest. She's perfect wife material. What will Tristan do, now that he's found the perfect woman right under his nose?</em></p>",
