            "description": "<p>Some of the best and brightest of the Corps — including Kyle Rayner, Soranik Natu, Ion and Guy Gardner — are sent on an urgent mission to locate and destroy missing Sinestro Corps Rings that remain from the Sinestro Corps War. But Mongul has a different idea on what to do with the Rings…</p> <p>• Mongul is standing upon a field of flowers called Mercy. He was told of their power from his father and he could sense it's effects as he's thinking about the plans he has for them. He collects as many as he can into a giant backpack and then asks his yellow power ring where the nearest Sinestro Corps member is. When the ring locates the information, Mongul tells the ring to take him there. </p> <p>• We see various members of the Green Lantern Corps in the middle of their duty, or relaxation or other thing, Vath Sarn is teaming up with Adam Strange. Iolande is in the middle of her royal duties. Sorak Natu is in the middle of vacation. Stel is in the process of putting himself back together againâ€”literally. Isamot Kol was also on break, Sodam Yat was taking in some yellow solar energy and Guy Gardner was snoozing when they all got a call to go to the Citadel. </p> <p>• On the planet Sedas in a Penal Institute of Mental Health, Duel Eknham is killing two doctors. His two different persons that make up the being of Duel Eknham are debating on how they should have killed the two doctors when a yellow power ring moves towards them saying he/they have the ability to instill great fear and he becomes the newest member of the Sinestro Corps. The two personalities begin to argue over which hand should have the yellow power ring when Mongul barges. Mongul tells the newly appointed Sinestro Corps member of how he obtained all of his yellow rings and he has a choice: Follow Mongul or dieâ€”not a hard choice, huh? </p> <p>• Back at the Citadel, Sodam Yat, Kyle Rayner, Guy Gardner, Arisia, Isamot, Kol, Sorak Natu, and the rest of the Green Lanterns called to the Citadel are wondering why they were all called together. Soon enough, the Guardians tell them that they are to go to the Vega System to retrieve yellow power rings that have entered that system. Sodam Yat wonders why they are allowed to go to the Vega System as he thought that that area was forbidden. The Guardians tell the Green Lanterns that they will be allowed into the system, but once there, they would have to use their own skills to track the rings. Sodam Yat wonders why they just don't take out manufacturing center that was making the rings, but the Guardians told Sodam Yat that the Guardians will tell them when that time will come. With a few last words from Kyle, the group is off. </p> <p>• The Green Lanterns enter sector 2828, the Vega System. Once they two, the group split up into teams of two. A creature is attacking a bunch of innocents when Guy and Kyle barge in on his fun. At the same time, Sodam Yat and Arisia are checking things out in another area. Sodam wants Arisia's opinion on how she thinks he is doing since becoming ION. Arisia asks Sodam why he wants to know and he's about to tell her he had heard a rumor that she was the first choice for ION when they both see the handiwork of Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner. </p> <p>• Sodam and Arisia investigate the area a bit more to discover 1,012 dead beings. Upon analyzing the dead bodies, they discover that there is more than one Sinestro Corp member in the area when their rings detect a warning. Elsewhere, Iolande and Sorak Natu are searching for rings when they get a call from Kyle and Guy checking on the progress of the other Lanterns. Sorak and Iolande say they had no luck. Isamot and Vath are the only others that found a Sinestro Corps member and as that is being relayed, Sorak and Iolande see the results of Isamot and Vath's work. However, nobody has heard from Sodam Yat or Arisia. </p> <p>• When they meet up, they begin their search for Arisia and Sodam Yat. Kyle signals to Salaak that the Green Lantern group is holding off their primary mission in order to find the two missing Lanterns. Salaak explains that they must remain dedicated to their primary mission. Kyle tells Salaak that he will not attend anyone else's funerals or memorial services and nobody is going to be left behind. The group finds a trail and they all go off in search of their missing comrades. </p> <p>• Elsewhere, we see Mongul with many rings on as he uses the power to burn a hole deep inside the planet. With him is Arisia and Sodam Yat who are infected with the Mercy flower.</p>",

Scores will be settled the unfriendly way. Taking control of your future sometimes means cutting loose your past!</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>After escaping from the claws of the Sith, Cade has some loose ends to tie up.</p><p>Rav is at home in the Golden Gorg Cantina, in his Crimson Axe, a safe place for the bounty hunters guild, when he spots the scum Screeger slipping in the back door. Followed by Cade, Jariah Syn, Chak, and Kee armed and ready to demand to settle some business with Rav. Their first demand is to get the Grinning Liar, Chak and Kee’s ship, back. Rav’s reply is to announce how Cade has a big price on his head and to try and have his gang try and capture Cade. A battle ensures with Cade using his lightsaber and force abilities. Syn is still uneasy with Cade being a Jedi, but is happy he’s on his side.</p><p>The battle ends with Cade using Dark Force Lightning on Rav, and making Rav swear an allegiance to Cade just like Cade had to do along time ago to Rav. After which the get the Grinning Liar back.</p><p>As soon as Cade and his gang are gone, Rav is in contact with Darth Maladi to inform her of Cade’s recent activity. In Darth Maladi’s chamber we see Darth Nihl and Darth Talon recover in stasis chambers, from their previous battle with Cade. Darth Maladi then transfers credits and threatens Rav if he is found unfaithful to her. Upon which Rav swears the same allegiance to her as he did Cade.</p><p>Back on Bastion, Emperor Roan Fel summons Master Krieg. The Emperor is mad that he let Princess Marasiah Fel to allow Cade leave bastion at all, while Master Krieg points out that Cade did save her life in the first place. Emperor Fel reply that his responsibilities is to the galaxy not with a junkie, and is worried what the sith might have been able to drag out of Cade concerning Fel’s whereabouts. Meanwhile in the Green houses, Princess Marasiah finds Antares Draco to tell him that her father has a mission for the three of them. Antares does not wish the Princess to go, and she can sense how he feels about her. She says how she knows he has been avoiding her on orders of the emperor, her father, but she does not intend to let her father interfere with her love life, and they kiss.</p><p>Back on Socorro Cade and Syn see Chak and Kee off in the Grinning Liar, and decides to let Screeger ride along in the Mynock. They put Screeger in the brig because they do not trust him. As they take off we see an unknown figure shot a tracer onto the Mynock. Cade and Syn decide to go to Rawk’s Nest and drop off Screeger someplace before they arrive. While on the Mynock, Cade goes and smoothes things over with Deliah Blue, about how he feels about her and what she saw himdo when he was in the sith temple.</p><p>When they finally arrive at Rawk’s Nest the black sun are attacking and they help to fend them off. As they land we see the unnamed figure a ways away watching them.</p>",
