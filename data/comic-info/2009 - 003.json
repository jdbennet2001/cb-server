But this Spidey isn't Peter Parker--it's Ben Reilly, the Spider-Clone! And Wolverine's claws are made of bone, not adamantium! It's radical...it's extreme...and if we coulda put a chromium cover on it, we would have! Put down your pogs and pick this up if only to feast your eyes on Mario Alberti's art! It'll make you say \"Cowabunga, dude!\"</em></p><p>A few years ago, the X-Men are up against Mr. Sinister once again. He leaves before the battle is over. The X-Men search his place for any clues to his next hiding place. They find a box that may give them a lead and allow them to return a favor.</p><p>In the city, Spider-Man (actually Ben Reilly, the Scarlet Spider when he took over for Spidey) is chasing Slyde. He is stopped by Iceman. As \"Spider-Man\" is about to leave, Storm reminds him of when he came to them about Kraven and Sinister's team-up. He says he remembers it but Wolverine knows he's lying. He has no choice but to tell them that he's not the same Spider-Man he knows. He tells them the one they know was a clone (that's what he and Peter Parker were lead to believe at the time). The X-Men tell him that they found some notes of data exchange between Sinister and Miles Warren (the dude that cloned Spider-Man). What concerns Ben Reilly is there are notes on Cletus Kasady, also known as Carnage. They plan on paying him a visit.</p><p>At the Ravencroft Institue, Sinister is already visiting Carnage. He wants to make a deal with him. Before anything can happen, the X-Men and Scarlet Spider arrive. A fight begins, Carnage bites Wolverine's bone claws, Sinister gets upset. He tries controling their mind but finds Spider-Man resisting him. He pushes further and Ben pushes back with the memories of his life. Sinister is disgusted and calls him a \"mockery of life.\" After he leaves and Carnage is put on ice, Ben wonders what he meant by that. Cyclops tells him not to listen to Sinister. Spidey asks Wolverine if he can tell the difference but is told they smell the same. As far as he's concerned, he is Spider-Man.</p><p>Back at Sinister's (latest) lab, he seems to have just about perfected the sample he took from Kasady.</p>",

Will his quest for the truth unleash an even greater danger upon those around him? The only way to make sure it doesn't is by facing off against his greatest enemy - himself!  </i><br /><i>Plus: Gambit has just been hired for the biggest job of his young life - a heist at the Weapon X facility! Bonne chance, mon ami!   </i><br /> <br /><u>Note</u>: Issue includes a cover gallery for the volume, as well as a pinup by Michael Ryan. Also includes a preview for <a data-ref-id=\"4000-151135\" href=\"/black-panther-the-deadliest-of-the-species-part-one/4000-151135/\"> Black Panther #1</a>.<br /> <br /><h3>Synopsis<br /></h3><h4>Part 3, The Devil Inside<br /></h4>After a training session in the Danger Room, Wolverine meets once again with Xavier to sort out more of his memories. Xavier explains that Wolverine will be going it alone this time. After fashioning a special helmet, Wolverine is back in his memories. His memory self (Weapon X) is taken into the facilities and Wolverine follows. He wanders away and finds the doctors. He realizes they can't talk because he has no memory of where he finds them. He searches out Weapon X to see what his memories really have to share. <br /> <br />Weapon X escapes and finds Wolverine. The two begin fighting and Wolverine realizes that one must give in to the other. Wolverine does so and incorporates himself into Weapon X. This allows him to see his memories first-hand. He goes berserk. He hacks and slashes his way through the Weapon X facility before he finds the female doctor that had shown him kindness. The two escape until Weapon X finds the man responsible for the experimentation. Weapon X attacks and Wolverine is brought to his senses in reality when the X-Men are having to pry him off Xavier. After a few moments, Xavier thinks the danger has passed. Wolverine feels differently and leaves the X-Men alone with Xavier. <br /> <br />Later, Wolverine meets with Xavier and asks him to erase all the horrible memories the two have drawn out. Xavier refuses, stating that those memories are proof that Wolverine has grown. The two compromise: Xavier will block those memories out until Wolverine is more capable of reliving them. Wolverine suggests that those blocks never be taken down. He is shown later as a man that feels as if he is forgetting something. It's a normal feeling by now. He decides to get on with life. <br /> <br /><h4>The Job<br /></h4>A young Gambit infiltrates the Weapon X facility to retrieve a lost diary. In doing so, he stumbles upon a room that houses tanks filled with humanoids. Shocked, he backs into a series of crashes. Guards confront him but get called away to deal with the Weapon X escape before anything can happen. Gambit finds the diary and leaves during the assault of the experimented-on mutant. Outside, Gambit figures any diary found in that devilish facility deserves to burn. He burns the book.  <br /> <br />Back in New Orleans, Gambit admits that he couldn't find the diary. The owner, Nathaniel Essex, forgives the charge and pays the Theives' Guild. Back at his labs, Mr. Sinister plans for future uses of Gambit.",

Hot on the heels of the 2008 summer film release Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Mike Mignola and Duncan Fegredo reunite with Hellboy: The Wild Hunt to follow-up on the events of their best-selling 2007 series Hellboy: Darkness Calls. This issue also includes a back-up story written by Mike Mignola and drawn by B.P.R.D. artist Guy Davis!</i></p>",

            "description": "<i>By now you know that Lucas Bishop—former cop, renegade X-Man—refuses to rest until he's killed the so-called \"mutant messiah.\" But do you know why? To answer that question you have to look into Bishop's past…which actually means jumping 50 years into the future, when his parents barely escaped a nuclear holocaust, only to land in the most brutal \"mutant relocation\" camp in the world. There, a young Bishop first heard the horror stories about the green-eyed monster that ushered in the the downfall of mutantkind, and swore vengeance -- embarking on a life-long, time-hopping mission that begins here, in this special three-part mini-series. You haven't heard the \"Messiah Complex\" story until you've heard Bishop's side of the story… </i>",

Her detective instincts may have led her to the truth, but when the restless dead stage a bloody revolt, it'll take much more than that to survive long enough to do anything about it.</i></p><p>The riots are just building over the two policemen accused of abuse of power and killing a civilian. They are being held for their own safety at the headquarters and the new commander isn't happy about it. The force is stretched thin trying to contain the demonstration.</p><p>Meanwhile Alice,Peter and three heavily armed riot police fly into Mots Island and enter the facility looking for Brendan Glenn, the head of the research team using the facility for research. Alice and the 2 policemen head into the building while Peter stays with the controller.</p><p>Descending into the facilities most dangerous area Alice warns the men not to remove their gear as it will protect them from electrical attacks while she has a brass grid etched into her skull that acts as a personal Faraday cage. The walls are decayed and the lighting sparse down here. Alice deploys outriders (3 floating probes with sensors and lights to go out ahead of them), the maintenance is poor and the local suppressor hasn't been able to do its job in the lower levels. the walls in one section have been warped into the shape of a massive skull.</p><p>they come to a door and as Alice looks at it it opens by itself and the voice floats out\" You Came, You Found Me!\". Inside the room is a skull and ribcage surrounded by blue-light and thick twists of cable. In the same room the police find a bio-hazard bin with the remains of Yani's in them and the bodies of two exected contact works. Glenn is in the back of the room holding a pistol.</p><p>Alice questions Glenn about his motives for killing Yanis and releasing the monsters when no-one had any idea what they were doing until then. Glenn tells them that a voice in his head told him to do it. Glenn stands and revels he is a zombie with the back of his head a gaping hole Alice immediately realizes he is a puppet and this must be a jail break.</p><p>They rush for the door only for one policeman to have his head removed by a massive green spiked humanoid monster. Glenn explains he was a Brazilian drugs lord's enforcer who they bonded a million razors into his ghost form. While the spider-like one,his legs are knives, is a man killed by a mob of vigilante parents and those people always come back as spiders. the spider kills on more of the men. Lastly a skeletal child who can project terrible images into peoples minds attacks the last man. Glenn talks about the first test an innocent man charged with many murders who was trained to kill at long range but failed to work as his ghost was preoccupied with explaining his innocence.

Mary Raven's asking questions about the death of her father Rock, here in the interzone settlement in the middle of Earth's last spaceport.

            "description": "<p>BASIC PLOT:</p><p><i>Chun-li &amp; crew run across both the deadly assassin Gen and kung-fu movie sensation Fei Long! What clues will they reveal about Sagat and Shadaloo’s latest caper? It’s Hong Kong action all the way as Chun-li demonstrates why she deserves to be called a Street Fighter legend!</i></p><p>DETAILED SYNOPSIS:</p><p>The issue opens in Hong Kong, ten years before the events of the previous two issues. A group of toughs, including a chinese man wearing glasses, are selling a truckload of drugs to a skeezy looking guy in a dark alleyway. Skeezy tells Glasses that the word on the street is that someone has hired a psycho to kill him, but Glasses just points to his massive bodyguard, Mongo, standing behind him and says that whoever the hired killer is, he isn't concerned.</p><p>Suddenly, stepping out of the shadows, an old man stands before them. He tells them he will be glad to give them the name. \"Gen.\" He says, identifying himself.</p><p>Gen then begins his attack, taking down every one - Mongo included - that tries to stop him. Finally, he stands before the man he has been hired to kill, and, with a poke to his throat, completes the task.</p><p>The time frame returns to the present, and Gen and Dorai sit within the restaurant from the previous issue. Dorai tells Gen that he is there on business, and with a smile Gen replies that he always thought what kept their friendship alive was the fact that they didn't talk \"business.\"</p><p>Dorai agrees, but says that he's desperate for leads. He knows something big is about to go down, and hoped Gen's old connections might be of help. Gen tells him that he can't help him because he has removed himself from that world ever since something occured which he is ashamed of, and which robbed him of THE KILLING INTENT. He says that in his line of work, being without that is like being a tiger without teeth and claws. The restaurant is now his life, Gen says, and while he has heard something big is imminent, he is out of the loop and he knows not what that something is.</p><p>Thanking him, Dorai leaves, saying that he is glad they are no longer on opposite sides of the law. Gen agrees and says that Dorai and Chun Li are always welcome. As Dorai leaves, however, Gen spies another car, following him.</p><p>The next day, Chun Li and Po Lin have been following some Shadaloo-linked Triads, when they finally make their move and rob a laundrymat. After a brief exchange of bullets, Po Lin has handcuffed one suspect who has taken a slug in the shoulder, and Chun Li is working on handcuffing the other one. Demanding to know what Sagat is up to, Po Lin starts choking her suspect, and Chun Li, worried that Po Lin is going to kill the man, lets her attention wander a bit too much. Her suspect manages to pull a weapon and escape under a hail of bullets.</p><p>Later that day, Fei Long is preparing to open a new exhibit which contains the largest collection of terracotta warriors outside of the China mainland, when suddenly he is challenged by a man in the crowd, who says that Fei Long is not a true martial artist, but a clown performing in front of the cameras. He challenges Fei Long, declaring that he will take him down in front of everyone and expose him as a fake.</p><p>The police are called and Dorai is told to report to the scene of the fight. Before he can get there, however, Fei Long has already finished things with a flaming DRAGON ARC KICK, knocking his opponent cold.</p><p>Fei Long tells Dorai that he won't be pressing charges - this sort of thing happens to him all the time - but Dorai says he'll still have to come downtown and fill out a report.</p><p>Meanwhile, two Shadaloo toughs take pictures of the scene, one telling the other that Sagat won't be happy that there are cops hanging out at the museum. Later on the two thugs are showing the pictures to Sagat, who identifies Dorai. Sagat says that Dorai infiltrated Shadaloo and shut down the arms pipeline between Hong Kong and Beijing before he was discovered, greatly displeasing Bison. Worried that Dorai may have discovered their plans, Sagat assigns five armed men to watch him.</p><p>Later, Chun Li and Po Lin sit together at a restaurant. Po Lin apologizes to Chun Li, saying that it was her fault that one of the suspects escaped, and they were almost killed. Chun Li says that she understands - she doesn't know how she's react if she lost her father.</p><p>Po Lin holds up the uniform that they confiscated from the suspect and says that she hopes Dorai will be able to identify it. Arriving right then, Dorai does just that, saying that the museum guards were wearing that uniform. The uniform also triggers the realization that the work schedule found on the Shadaloo agents in issue #1 corresponds to the guard shift change at the museum. \"They're planning on stealing the Terracotta statues!\" Dorai exclaims.</p><p>In a garage across the street from the restaurant, Shadaloo thugs with high tech listening devices overhear Dorai's conversation with Chun Li and Po Lin and report it to Sagat. Sagat says that the plan is already in motion and orders his men to take out all three of them.</p><p>Back in the restaurant, Chun Li sees the telltale red dot of a sniper appear on her father's chest, and puts herself in the line of fire...</p>",

We learn Skanda is a god much like thor and also that India is where beast and Cecelia got series. He ask the tema and sati to find out what they can as him and hank interrogate Sophie. She protest but her father has already been contacted and he has no problem with it. The team checks in on Megan who is recovering well even though no one knows how she could be taken down so easily. She retorts her mom wont be happy while beats says he did well. Her and oli talk as she confides that kalima breached all her defense as if they were nonexistent and she’s unsure if she will be able to help if they must face her again. Oli says no matter what he will always save her and the two kiss.</p><p>No-Name feels useless as she realizes that she never was as she thought the team “brain”. Rico shares his history with Sophie which mirrors his granddad and her fathers, they were friends and the ended enemies (he doesn’t explain why she would kiss him though). They were both thirteen year old wonders of the world going to MIT for a doctorate at that age. After Sophie’s experiments end badly he protects them with his powers but both get booted and his dad send him to Xavier’s and she apparently returned home to dad. Sati visits Megan and touches her why? She does not know but says she often does things she cant explain but they always work out right.</p><p>To get some answer they change into civilian clothes to check where Sophie got her equipment. Megan remains in telepathic communion with them all incase of danger. The interrogation does not go well as Sophie sticks to her story while Beast looks on. The kids arrive at the black market and Rico finds a man who knows the details of Sophie’s transaction but wont spill the beans. He wonders if megan can pick his brain to which oli says she’s not up to it. No-Name then talks to the man and is able to get the information and the address they need, Sophie was lying and they now know her base of operations.</p><p>They get to the warehouse and find robot parts to match those they faced before. At this point Sophie shows a hologram of them to beats and skanda saying the kids are better than she expected. She transforms into kalima and unleashes a spell that causes skanda and bets to battle each other, Megan tries to stop this but is affected by the spell as well.</p><p>In the warehouse kalima teleports in and cast the same spell turning the team on each other. Only oli and Sati are unaffected he reaches for her and absorbs her power, he gets flashes of varying images he cant understand and transforms his team including Megan into Indians and teleports them in different directions. Kalima is furious and demands to know what has happened. Sati does not know but kalima says the children and their souls will still be hers and they will all suffer. Sati meanwhile thinks yes they will suffer but they will win!</p>",

Anyway, point being-this issue explodes with excitement and ramps up the danger to lead us into…</i> <br /> <br /><i>Summary </i><br />Zartan stabs Cover Girl through the chest and before General Hawk can react Storm Shadow thrusts his sword into Hawk's gut.  Baroness takes the briefcase and the three Cobra soldiers make their exit from the bloody scene.  General Hawk staggers to press the silent alarm, while Cover Girl lays across from him dead.   <br /> <br />The alarm at the Pit blazes and the Joes all react as Cobra Vipers raid their base.  Duke blocks Baroness and she asks him if he could kill her as she walks closer towards him, though he hesitates to shoot.  A viper prepares to shoot Duke but Ripcord tackles him and the shot blows up the walkway that Baroness and Duke were on instead.  Ripcord pulls his gun out on Baroness and tells her to freeze, but Storm Shadow intercepts him and cuts his gun in two.  Storm Shadow prepares to slash Ripcord but Snake Eyes appears and counter his attacks.  Baroness gathers herself together but is tackled down by Scarlett.  The two women fight it out and Scarlett uses an invisibility cloak to disappear from Baroness' sight.  Unable to see her attacker, Baroness is easily subdued by Scarlett in her invisible cloaking.  Baroness quickly grabs some type of liquid near by and splashes it onto Scarlett disrupting her invisibility cloak advantage.  Scarlett momentarily stunned by this is now overtaken by Baroness.  Duke rushes towards Baroness and Scarlett just as Storm Shadow arrive on his jet pack to pick up Baroness for their escape.  Before Baroness and Storm Shadow leave, Baroness whacks Duke in the face with the briefcase and then they take off.   <br /> <br />Scarlett is alone in the bathroom looking at the bruises she got from Baroness choking her.  Ripcord walks in on her and they talk. <br /> <br />In a flashback, a young Snake Eyes sneaks into someone's home to steal some food to eat.  A young Storm Shadow calls out thief and attacks the young Snake Eyes.  An older man comes in and tells Storm Shadow to back off their young intruder and offers young Snake Eyes some help.  The old man becomes Snake Eye's martial arts master and quickly becomes his favorite pupil.  A scorned Storm Shadow is seemingly accused of murdering their master as it is seen that Storm Shadow's blade was used to kill their master.   <br /> <br />Scarlett and the other Joes are performing an autopsy on one of the dead Vipers that attacked the Pit where she discovers that the body has been imbued with nano mites.  Ripcord deduces that McCullen probably set them up when he asked them to open the case for him.  Breaker informs them that he has tracked the Baroness and they suit up and leave. <br /> <br />A tiny flashback reveals that Duke feels responsible for the death of Rex because he sent Rex into a house to search for something. <br /> <br />Baroness arrives in a lab in Paris where she tells her husband Leon to do her a favor.  After activating the warheads for her, Baroness kisses him and Storm Shadow stabs Leon and leaves him to die.  The Joes arrive onto the scene but they are too late Storm Shadow and Baroness are already on the move.  Snake Eyes leaps onto the Cobra's get away vehicle while the others pursue them in another vehicle.  Storm Shadow and Baroness manages to get Snake Eyes off the top of their vehicle but are now tailed by Duke and Ripcord who are in accelerator suits.  After a fancy chase scene, Storm Shadow and Baroness gets into a wreck with an oncoming train and decide to take the chase on foot.  Duke goes after Baroness who has the kill switch while Ripcord goes after Storm Shadow who has the warhead.  Storm Shadow manages to get a shot at the Eiffel Tower and leaps out the window before Ripcord can catch him.  The warhead hits the Eiffel Tower and it is consumed with nano mites which eat away at its construct.  Duke chases Baroness onto the roof of a building.  Baroness spots Storm Shadow in a helicopter and leaps out towards the helicopter.  With the help of the accelerator suit, Duke manages to leap on board with them as well.  Duke manages to hit the kill switch after a brief struggle and stops the nano mites from doing further damage.  Baroness congratulates Duke for being able to stop the attack on Paris, and Storm Shadow knocks Duke out.",

Unbelievable power courses through the lands... and A NEW WORLD ORDER is at hand. An epic story about the future of humans surviving in a world of magic, steering towards their own salvation...or doom. The next exciting chapter of the SOULFIRE mythos continues here as a host of new characters, and a few familiar ones, chart a course through the dark and undiscovered futuristic landscape of the planet.<br/><br/>In this issue, hell breaks loose as Cruz and his posse square off against Erich and the skinheads in an all-out gang war! While Cruz once again proves his loyalty to his roots, and the street way of life, the same cannot be said for his deceptive cousin, Manny. Meanwhile, Cole shockingly makes a 'deep' discovery about how Blackjack and Saxon have been able to track him so easily, and he takes out his aggression the only way he knows how-viciously and violently! Yet, even his sadistic measures will not be enough to take on Rainier's newest deadly weapon, as well as his grand scheme to annihilate all of the resurfaced beings of magic! Brought to you by the acclaimed international art team of Francisco Herrera and Leonardo Olea, with words provided by scribe J. T. Krul, SOULFIRE: NEW WORLD ORDER will leave you clamoring for more!<br/><br/>Plus, this 3rd issue also includes part 3 of a special 4 page back-up story brought to you by the upcoming SOULFIRE Volume 2 creative team of J.T. Krul, Marcus To, Saleem Crawford and Beth Sotelo.

If you don't pick up the third part of this fan-favorite series, you're all wet! </i><br/> <br/>After they brave after adventure through the Savage lands, battling with devil dinosaur. They then find themselves falling out of the sky and into the ocean below. Despite the efforts Redwing and Lockheed to save them, the Pet Avengers plunge into the ocean. <br/> <br/>But after doing so, they are saved, being encased in bubbles by Sea turtles, local guardians of Atlantis. Throg and the Pet Avengers ask the Turtles if they can help them find one of the remaining Infinity Gems. The turtles agree to help them find it... only to lead them right to the sleeping giant Giganto. <br/> <br/>Thanks to Hairball's scream of terror of actually being in the water, Giganto awakens and then swallows the Pet Avengers with one gulp. <br/> <br/>So they now sit on the tongue of the large creature trying to find a way to get out, as they do so, they discover one of the remaining infinity gems as Ms. Lion accidentally stumbles upon it.  <br/> <br/>After this, Lockjaw then manages to get the strength to actually teleport them from the creatures mouth and onto the lawn of the white house, where the last Infinity Gem is located, (around the collar of Bo Obama, the first dog).  <br/> <br/>Throg then devises a plan to get them inside the White house to find the Infinity Gem. Dragging the exhausted and heavy Lockjaw with them, they get inside by traveling inside a box that gets transported inside the White House. <br/> <br/>So they then drag Lockjaw as the go through the White house, even dragging him a flight of stairs to get to their goal. But as they do, they encounter Bo Obama on the stairway, seeing that he has the gem they're looking for. Bo Obama runs off and they give chase, only to find that Bo has been grabbed by Thanos! Who demands that they hand over the gems. What will the Pet Avengers do now? Read the next issue to find out!",

Power Girl battles Ultra-Humanite! And things get ugly as the two powerful beings come to blows!</i></p><p>The issue begins with Power Girl still trapped in the Ultra Humanites device. Yet as he gets close he notices that the machine is icing up. and she breaks out punching him. During the fight Power Girl shoots him with her heat vision and burns his fur off and even some of his skin. She wants to get him medical attention, but the Ultra Humanite refuses to let Manhattan go. He insists that the only way that he will release the city is if she gives her body to him.Instead she smacks him around and then finds the control panel. It looks like an organ - a reference to 20,000 leagues under the sea. She can't figure out how to work it, so she destroys it instead and then flies off to get Terras help. Instead of lowering Manhattan, Terra raises enough earth to reattach it. Then the lowering begins. Together they put Manhattan back in place and save the day.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>With THE HOOD and MR. NEGATIVE locked in a battle to the death, BETTY BRANT is poised to unlock the secret origin of the Chinatown's lord of crime, and to stop her he has sent his newest corrupted enforcer to end her life-- PETER PARKER, the Lacerating SPIDER-MAN!</em></p><p>Hood and Mister Negative are battling in Martin Li/Negative's home. Negative has one of his charged swords, but Hood uses a variety of magical tricks including limited teleportation to keep up the fight. Negative then touches Hood, but seeing as a demon has already corrupted Robinson, the touch has no affect.</p><p>Spiderman meanwhile, corrupted by Negative's touch, pursues reporter Betty Brant, who is on the verge of discovering Negative's identity of Martin Li. Brant reflects on the fact that superhuman battles--especially ones involving Spiderman--have caused the deaths of two of her loved ones (her brother was killed by Doc Ock and her husband was murdered when Hobgoblin I framed him). She then says she is not them though and she wants to live. Spiderman continues to follow her, taunting in Negative's voice and with his costume tainted grey by Negative's powers. Betty Brant is fully aware that it is really the crimelord causing the murder, but Spiderman continues to hunt her down. Snagging her high heeled shoe with his webbing, Peter Parker causes Betty to fall through a glass window. Cleverly, Brant ties a piece of her clothes to a cat, so Spiderman follows that instead. Brant is near Mrs. Li's house, so she runs in there because she thinks Li told Mister Negative to attack and can call the attack off. The older lady insists she didn't think Negative would kill her, and tells Brant a story. Once when she was younger she had reached China before her husband, Martin Li. Wanting to see each other, a deal was made with a gang called the Dragon Lords to have Li smuggled into the country on the boat <em>Golden Mountain</em>. A gangster on the ship paniked as it reached land and forced the captain at gunpoint to go into shallow water. The ship ran aground, and most of the passengers died, including, it appeared, Mr. Li. The Dragon Lords insisted that Li had died on land, so they had completed their part of the deal. Of course, Martin Li had had the money, so Mrs. Li couldn't pay the debts.</p><p>The Dragon Lords took Mrs. Li to a house in Brooklyn and began to torture her to death as punishment, when Mister Negative burst in. At that time, Negative was unknown, and had no gang with him. However, armed with only a charged sword, Negative mercilessly slaughtered the Dragon Lords. Li was chained from the ceiling, and when she saw Negative he seemed completely cold and cruel, and the lady expected to be killed too. Negative asked who she was and Li told her story. Negative seemed confused and momentarilly turned into a man (the comic pannel shows Mister Negative's alter ego Martin). Negative then released Mrs. Li and left. Years later, Mrs Li heard of a Martin Li who survived the <em>Golden Mountain</em> wreck getting a megal from the president. Excited, she got a photo to see if it was her husband, but did not recognize him.</p><p>The corrupted Spiderman then appeared to kill Betty.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hood overpowered Negative. As Parker Robinson grasped his collar, Negative told Hood that he was the Dragon Lord who paniked and caused the <em>Golden Mountain</em> to crash. Gangsters had so mistreated the people they were smuggling that the passengers died. Negative had taken the papers, money, and identity of a passenger, who turned out to be named Martin Li. Negative tried to radio for help from the other Dragon Lords, but got no answer. Returning to New York trying to find answers, he was ambushed by Silvermane, who had taken over Queens from the Dragon Lords (which was why Negative's signal hadn't been answered). Silvermane was amused that Negative was a Dragon Lord (also known as Snakeheads), so he threw him in with several other prisoners at an abandoned place on Ellis Island instead of killing him. Silvermane had the prisoners tested on as a chemist named Simon Marshall tried to develop a drug to replace heroin. Though most people died, Li became a Jekyll/Hyde creature, with a good side and and a very dark side with super powers. When a prisoner named Tyrone (possibly Rapier) was able to break out, Negative and Tyrone's girlfriend escaped. Negative departed from the couple, and adopted the good side as Martin Li and the dark side as Mister Negative. The Li side it appears was unaware of the Mister Negative side.</p><p>At the exact same time, Spiderman was killing Betty. Mrs. Li tried to stop him, but she was knocked down. Brant thoughy of how she used to blame Spiderman but now she new he was just a victim. However, as the wallcrawler was strangling Brant he remembered when his secret identity of Peter Parker loved Betty. Fighting back the corruption, he expelled Mister Negative's touch from his body (which left in the form of smoke). Spiderman apologized (though Brant was unaware he was Peter). Betty told him it was \"No problem,\" but she was coughing badly.</p><p>Hood continued to hold Negative, who told Robinson that he only said his story to him because Robinson would die from the demon (Dormammu) inside him before it could cause harm. Then he said that the yin/yang signs in his garden stood for what he believed was a balance in the world. He says that since he allows Li to continue he is able to prosper more in both identities, unlike Robinson who has let evil take him over almost completely. However, it is quite evident that the Negative persona is stronger and is manipulating the situation over the Li persona. Several members of Hood's gang (including Speed Demon, White Rabbit, Squid, Answer, and Bloodshed) enter, and Hood says that Negative is about to die. Then, though, Norman Osborn calls telling him to stop the murder. As Hood argues, he lets go of Negative, who vanishes. Osborn is then seen telling his Goblin persona that it was all a plan to get the evidence Martin Li II had discovered of experimentation on illegal Asian immigrants by Oscorp.</p><p>Spot, who was working for Hood, then enters Negative's office, having stolen the evidence back. Negative says the evidence shows that whatever Li does it will always be corrupted. It is then revealed that Spot had been an inside man the entire time and had helped Negative escape. In return, Negative was helping to cure the condition of interdimensional (possibly from the Spot Dimension) corruption that Spot and Negative both had (though only Spot wanted to cure it).</p><p>Brant is then seen talking to Martin Li, planning to do a piece on Martin's construction projects to help the community. She says that even though her boss at the DB Dexter Bennett doesn't want her supporting Li (a political adversary of Bennet's allies), she wants a more balanced piece since her last one was a dangerous \"wild goose chase.\" Brant then sees the destruction caused by the Hood/Negative fight and asks Martin how he doesn't hate the crimelords for causing it. Li then says that there is balance and without the evil of Negative he would never have a chance to do so much good. The final pannel shows Martin Li with half his body as a laughing Mister Negative.</p>",

            "description": "<i>It was only a handful of years ago that Tomas, Pug and Roland were a trio of best friends, running around the Castle Crydee, getting into scrapes and toasting their friendship. Now, Roland is the only one who remains in Crydee. Tomas finds himself deep in the Elf wood, Elvandar, while the elves see him falling deeper under the control of his enchanted armor. Pug, on the other side of the magical rift, in the land of the Tsurani, encounters the “Great Ones”, Tsurani magicians who have great powers, and a great interest in the captured human. And back at Crydee, a commotion at the lighthouse and a mysterious approaching ship raise the stakes. Roland may try to find solace in the arms of Princess Carline, but a greater threat looms on the horizon… one that could mean the end of Crydee itself!</i>",

            "description": "<p>Stephanie Brown continues her pursuit of gaining the trust and blessing of Barbara Gordon in her torn Batgirl suit. She is out to fight off the Scarecrow, with back-up at least 5 minutes away. Barbara again tries to dissuade her from going in, but non-the-less tells her where a fear gas inoculation is in Cassandra's utility belt, a statement that does not go unnoticed by Stephanie. Scarecrow, meanwhile releases a new toxin to 2 of his men which causes them to fight each other.</p><p>Meanwhile Stephanie takes out two of Scarecrows goons and soon comes face to face with the Scarecrow himself. Scarecrow releases a new version of the fear gas and Stephanie is forced to flee after being cut by Scarecrow. As Barbara monitors the activity, Stephanie is beginning to hallucinate. Scarecrow kicks her down a flight of stairs, but when she turns around she sees Tim Drake in the Robin uniform. The weaponized Rage-Drug is messing with her mind and soon she gets stabbed in the arm. The hallucinations change to her former identity as Spoiler, as Scarecrow is brutally beating Stephanie, now the Batgirl costume is torn all over the place, including half of her cowl.</p><p>Stephanie begins to black out, remembering things Barbara, a thug, and her mother told her. Barbara screams for her to wake up ,calling her Batgirl for the first time. Stephanie wakes up and begins fighting back, gaining the upper hand, she remembers a question she was asked the other day about about why she stays; her answer because she doesn't know how to do anything else even if that means setting yourself up for failure. When Scarecrow asks her why she stays when she is going to have to face herself and no one is brave enough to do that. She tells him she is he asks her what might that be and she responds \"I'm Batgirl!\" Barbara seems happy to hear this stating that she just might be. As the Police arrive, Stephanie leaves.</p><p>Back at home, Steph makes waffles for her mother and Barbara goes to see Wendy Harris and tells her that she is always available to talk. Barbara takes a position as Assistant Professor at Gotham University, where Stephanie is one of her students.</p><p>Back at the Batcave, Barbara makes an oath with Stephanie, much the same way Bruce did with Dick. She pledges to support Stephanie as she has supported others, letting her know she won't be alone out there. Barbara gives her a new Batgirl suit. Stephanie heads out on the town in her new suit, ready for what the night will bring.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Volume Three of award-winning author Warren Ellis’ ongoing web comic, FREAKANGELS, is here! This installment collects the entire third arc of the post-apocalyptic saga into 144 gorgeous, full-color pages. Twenty-three years ago, twelve strange children were born in England at exactly the same moment. Six years later, the world ended. Today, eleven strange 23-year-olds are living in and defending Whitechapel, maybe the last real settlement in flooded London. They’ve made a new friend, and together they successfully defended their home from raiders–but the post-apocalyptic drowned London that the eleven Freakangels survive in is never a safe place, and never surrounded by friends. In FREAKANGELS: VOLUME THREE, the FreakAngels begin to address how to build their community while a serial killer stalks in their midst. Everything almost comes crashing down around them as one of their own breaks their most valued rule. Ellis’ ongoing story of a flooded London is beautifully illustrated in jaw-dropping detail by Paul Duffield, and every page is as much a work of art as it is a compelling and multi-layered story.</em></p>",

Or rather, just kind of tilts it slightly to the side. Stories include \"Being Awesome Is Its Own Reward,\" where two brothers deal with a giant monster rampaging through their city, and \"Mighty Malcum,\" in which an 11 year old genius and his robot best friend attempt to adjust to college life. There's also stories of pirates, time-traveling babies, martial arts masterminds and an all new short story from Elfworld. ISBN: 978-1-60309-055-1<br /></i></p>",

            "description": "<i>When a kotodama-sama dies, his or her kami-sama – a healer made of  living paper – typically chooses to die as well, returning to a blank  state as “hakushi.” But when Himi’s master passes away, a deep sense of  obligation forces him to choose another path. Instead, Himi becomes  kami-sama for his master’s estranged son, Genma.  Genma is everything Himi’s former kotodama-sama was not – rough,  arrogant, brutish – and furthermore, Genma enjoys using Himi for his own  selfish pleasure. Is this more torment than Himi can endure? Or will he  come to realize that different people show their true feelings in  different ways?</i>",
