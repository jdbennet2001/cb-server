            "description": "<p><em>You were wowed by the first two issues of this comic. But wait until you read issue three. Mark Millar (Civil War) and John Romita Jr (World War Hulk) only up the odds here and the pace is breathtaking. I read it weeks ago and I'm still having nightmares. Never have I seen such sickening violence sold to readers in the name of entertainment. If it wasn’t selling so well we’d have to stop publishing this monster. Follow Dave’s journey from zero to hero as he becomes a youtube celebrity. He sure kicked the ass of those drop-outs, didn’t he? Join us this issue where he inspires others to dress up and hurt people.</em></p><p><strong>Kick-Ass issue 3 overview (spoilers ahead)</strong></p><p>The issue begins with a Youtube video being played of Kick-ass defending a man from local mobsters/gangsters the video in its short time being up has already amassed 10,586 views thus making Dave an internet celebrity and giving him his superhero codename. <strong>Kick-Ass!</strong></p><p>It also gives Dave a newfound confidance in high school and his rep has been incresed by the fact that people think he is homo-sexual, due too being found in the street naked after being hit by a truck. After a confrontation with his dad Dave ponders practicing \"roof jumping\" but cannot amass the courage to do it and simply decides to walk.</p><p>While on the ground he is regonized and praised by a man in his room who screams his name and a girl in an passing car that flashes him. It is also revealed he set up a MYspace page where people with problems can contact him. He heads up the apartment for his job: too convince a man named Eddie Lomas to stop harassing his ex girlfriend. When asked what hes gonna do about it Dave threatens him, then hits him with pepper spray before being attacked by everyone else in the room.</p><p>He is brutally beaten down as a 10 year old girl named Hit-girl armed with two katanas bursts in and kills everyone in the room without displaying a hint of remorse.</p>",

Is Tony Stark really a- -? And who's that guy with an eye patch coming to save the day?? And, oh man, who did he bring with him?</i></p><p>The S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier is floating in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. Commander Hill tries getting her crew to figure out where they are. Going up top she gets a surprise visitor. \"Jarvis\" is there asking for her complete surrender.</p><p>At Thunderbolt Mountain, Venom goes flying out the side courtesy of Captain Marvel. He holds Swordsman in his grip and prepares to deliver a fatal blow when Norman Osborn comes up to him, amidst the wreckage. He introduces himself and asks if he'd like to talk over what he's doing over a drink.</p><p>At Camp Hammond, Gauntlet, Taskmaster, and Diamondback prepare to move the recruits to their barracks since all their tech is down and they have no contact with the outside world. Yellowjacket staggers to them and informs them that the city's under attack by aliens. He says they need to get all the cadets suited up.</p><p>In Times Square, the Young Avengers are trying to save people and fight the super-Skrulls. Hulkling figures that perhaps he can talk to them since he is half Skrull and the son of Princess Anelle. Whether they understand him or not, they simply blast away at him. Things don't look good until the Initiative arrives.</p><p>In the Savage Land, \"Spider-Woman\" attacks Echo. Echo tells her she's not a Skrull and Spider-Woman says, \"I know\" and takes her down. She makes her way to where Tony Stark is trying to fix his armor and fight off the virus. Spider-Woman tells him he can relax, his work is done. She proceeds to tell him he's been such a brave warrior and will always have the love of his Queen. Tony has no idea what she's talking about and denies that he is a Skrull. She tells him that the truth had to be hidden from him. Tony doesn't know what to say.</p><p>Back in Times Square, the Skrulls don't seem bothered by the arrival of the Initiative. There are casualties as Vision feels their full wraith. It appears that the heroes have lost until everything around them begins to vibrate. A Skrull explodes as Nick Fury arrives with his Commandos.</p>",

            "description": "<p>It’s the Young X-Men vs. the new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants! A traitor is revealed and the casualties mount as the team goes to battle. We hope there are Young X-Men left when the smoke clears.</p> <p>*<strong><em>SPOLERS*</em></strong></p> <p>In the wake of the X-Men disbanding, Cyclops recruited a new team of heroes, made up of the last generation of mutants: Wolf Cub, Dust, Blindfold, Rockslide, and a previously undiscovered mutant, Eric Gitter, codenamed Ink. He gathered them in the ruins of the Xavier Institute and charged them with hunting the new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, whose members consist of Cannonball, Magma, Sunspot and Dani Moonstar, the former New Mutants. On their first mission, Rockslide, Wolf Cub and Dust ambushed Magma, while Ink and Blindfold tracked Dani Moonstar to her home in Colorado. After subduing Moonstar, Ink wheeled on Blindfold without warning and knocked her unconscious.</p> <p>What happened:</p> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li> <p>Manhattan, New York: Ink brings the unconscious Blindfold and Dani Moonstar to his mysterious employer. It appears that Eric works as mercenary, not taking part in any mutant factions. Meanwhile in L.A., the remaining Young X-Men's fight with Magma doesn't go well: She makes Dust into a glass statue. Rockslide remains intact despite her attack, but only Wolf Cub's cut from behind – risking a burn – scratches Magma and gives them a win.</p></li> <li> <p>Cannonball and Sunspot watch a newscast about the events in L.A. They know the X-Men are back and after them, meaning the surprise element is no more on the Young X-Men's side.</p></li> <li> <p>In the Young X-Men headquarters, Cyclops is spying on Sam and Roberto, listening to their conversation via a bug. Ink is back and tells Scott that Dani got her powers back and surprised Blindfold and him, and then took his partner as a hostage.</p></li> <li> <p>Above, in the ruins of the mansion, hides a mysterious kid. He watches Cyclops and Ink and talks to himself. Eventually the kid comes to a conclusion: He should kill Cyclops.</p></li> <li> <p>In an unknown location, Blindfold wakes up. Dani is standing above her and ready to beat her and get answers.</p></li> <li> <p>Santo and Wolf Cub tell Ink that Blindfold can't be dead, because she had a vision of the team – including her – fighting Donald Pierce. Eric is surprised to hear that he too will be part of the fight. Santo also says that Dust will be okay, as seen in Blindfold's vision.</p></li> <li> <p>Wolf Cub watches Magma in her cell, glad she is not dead. He tells Cyclops that at first he was okay with allegedly killing her, but later he felt bad. Scott says that he shouldn't feel bad, because there are not many options to deal with threats on Mutantkind post M-Day or the destruction of Genosha.</p></li> <li> <p>The use of the Danger Cave's recordings of people with medical knowledge to help Dust proves a failure. Rockslide says there is a need for someone smarter to cure her.</p></li> <li> <p>A Californian prison, the place is under attack. One of the cells is being breached from the outside by a guy who looks like Eric Gitter and shares the same abilities, but answers to the name Carlos. He came to free the prisoner residing in the breached cell.</p></li> <li> <p>Back to the unknown location, Dani still hits Blindfold. The latter says the name of Donald Pierce, who then shows up from behind Dani.</p></li></ul>",

Can this team get their act together before their mysterious foes reveal themselves?</em></p><p>Raven tells the others about Trigon's plans and that he seems to have another child. Starfire asks why he'd want to kill all the Titans. Raven tells them that there's magic in names. They've been the only ones to defeat him. Raven says that she was able to psychically pick up the names of three other brides Trigon had. They set out to find them.</p><p>Flash and Donna discover that the lady they're looking for has been dead for almost three years. They wonder why there's been no record of her death. Later Flash mentions how sad it is not having any contacts or family. He also throws in that Donna knows what that's like. They get into a fight about family. Flash says that being married and having kids is a lot of work. Donna says she'd give up anything to have her husband and son back. They continuing arguing until they are interupted by Cyborg.</p><p>Nightwing and Starfire visit the former home of the second bride. The neighbors have told them that she died about two years ago but they can't be certain whether or not she had a child (with Trigon). Starfire comments on the sadness of dying alone. She tells Dick that when she feels alone she thinks of him. Dick replies that he thinks of her when he's not alone. Next thing they know, costumes are off and they're rolling around of the floor.</p><p>Roy, Raven, and Beast Boy visit the husband of the third. She died about four years ago from a brain aneurysm. Raven is on edge and bluntly asks if she had any kids with him or anyone before. The husband starts to get offended but Raven just gets in his face. The woman had changed her name twice and there's no record of her death. Beast Boy pulls her out. Outside Raven insists that he must've been hiding something. Soon Raven and Beast Boy are trading insults and blows. Roy has no choice but to shoot Beast Boy, who is in the form fo a giant bear. He's about to shoot again when Nightwing stops him.</p><p>Donna comments on how they've all been acting out of character. They've been caught up in Envy, Lust, and Rage. Three of the Deadly Sins. A voice says it's one for each of them. Three of Trigon's children stand ready to take on the Titans.</p>",

After this they only know she is still missing and the team may try something, Scott hopes not and wants to put pressure on them not to. Hank sees this as an x-men moment much like when they were kids but Scott cant as the x-men are disbanded and this is literally a school with no super heroics he laments that he cant have the kids do anything outlandish as if something goes wrong then the reality of the mistakes will have to be dealt with by him. Emma is attacked telepathically and seemingly taken over.</p><p>Bekka is being tested in the control and use of her power x23 cause her to lose control, Emma doppelganger makes her collapse and hank takes them all to the infirmary so he can check her vitals as a student finds Emma body all decked out in black.

            "description": "<p>(Tarnax VII, many months ago) <br/> Xavin continues his training under the tuition of Commander Chrell. Xavin is under pressure and sweats profusely. Chrell says, \"He loves you, Xavin, but you will fail him.\" He adds that he will fail the Skrull Empire. He will die and his loved ones will die because of him. He tells Xavin to try again. The young Skrull leaps into the air, forming his fist into that resembling the Thing's. As he punches, Chrell moves and Xavin's fist shatters the ground underneath. \"Too slow, my pupil,\" gloats Chrell. Xavin immediately creates a flame from the same fist and unleashes it at his teacher. Chrell is far too experienced to get caught out by that maneuver, and he reminds Xavin that his mind is his weapon. He should use it to out-think his opponent. He should win the battle before it <em>starts</em>.<br/><br/> </p><p>Xavin forms an invisible hammer, utilizing yet another of the Fantastic Four's powers. He brings it down hard at Chrell, but his teacher blocks the attack with his staff. \"No... that's not possible,\" gasps the young prince. Chrell replies that, even if he hadn't taught him everything he knows, Xavin is still telegraphing his attacks... even the invisible ones. He smacks Xavin to the ground with the staff and stands over him. He hopes Xavin makes a better groom than he does a warrior.</p> <p>Xavin admits that he is a failure. He is a disgrace to the great Kl'rt's name. Chrell informs him that Kl'rt fared no better when he faced him during <em>his</em> training. Even when he learned to use all of his powers together. Xavin should always remember that when you face a superior opponent, learn their weakness. Exploit them. \"That is the Skrull way,\" he adds with a wink.</p> <p>(Earth, New York City, Invasion   49 minutes) <br/> X'iv watches over the city from high on a ledge about two thirds up the Empire State Building. She hears the screams and panicking of the populous below, and finally hears Dorrek's name mentioned. She informs Chrell by radio that her target has been re-acquired. \"Prepare to receive.\"</p> <p>Down below, Speed rockets from a subway station past the running crowd, having decided not to take a trip on Xavin's invisible discs. Xavin is annoyed. \"I said <strong>low profile</strong>! Is he <em>insane</em>,\" she asks Teddy. Possibly, he replies. Probably, adds Wiccan. Tommy runs off, telling them that he's going to check on the others. Wiccan calls after him but it's too late. Xavin says they should forget him and keep moving, but Teddy asks where to. Speed is right. They have to get back to their team. Xavin turns and asks if he's been listening. Doesn't he understand? He can't help them by <em>dying</em>!</p> <p>Teddy asks what he's supposed to do. If he's this big savior, what is he supposed to do? Xavin doesn't have an answer for that particular question. She thinks that they should broadcast to the entire Skrull armada. They have to know that he is alive and that he is there. They have to know that their prophecy is a lie and that there is a different way. They ought to know that this invasion is the work of mad Skrulls and not the love of Gods. They need to find a satellite uplink; some kind of communications center. Teddy informs her that there is a TV network on Rockefeller Plaza. It's close by so they can broadcast from there. As he speaks, Tommy returns and tells them that they have to go. Nick Fury is in Times Square. \"Vision is...\" Before he can say what has happened to their friend, a circle appears around them. It’s too late for Xavin to warn them as they disappear into thin air.</p> <p>They reappear in a heap, some distance away in a large plaza. Xavin and Dorrek are deposited a short distance away from where X'iv appears. She is carrying Tommy in one half of her cloak and Billy in the other. Teddy warns her to let them go. Xavin says that he knows her. She is X'iv, right? They trained together on Tarnax. She asks her not to do this. The prophecy is wrong. She <em>has</em> to listen. A voice behind them says that X'iv <em>did</em> listen. Xavin turns and gasps. Standing there is her old tutor, Commander Chrell. He stands with one foot on Old Lace's neck, as Klara looks over the sleeping Molly. He has Chase, Victor and Nico trapped inside invisible forcefields and his elasticized arm wrapped around Karolina - his fingers gripping her throat. Chrell tells Xavin that he has always liked her. He always has. She did her duty for the Empire and he respects that. Now she can do her duty for her God.</p> <p>Xavin pleads with him not to do this. She says that he said he didn't believe in the prophecies. Chrell admits that he doesn't, but what is happening here is divine right. He tells Xavin that she can have her bride back, and together, she and her Majesdanian tramp can go anywhere in the universe. But first, she will kill Dorrek for him, because the Skrulls do not need a savior. They have Earth. Meanwhile, Klara tells a recovering Molly that she doesn't know what to do. She starts to cry and wishes she was elsewhere. Xavin's fist bursts into flames, and Chase asks her not to do this. They can take them together. Xavin replies that she cannot. Chrell trained her. She cannot defeat him. She tells Teddy that she is sorry. Klara grinds her fingers into the dirt and wishes she could go to the City of Angels. \"Make it go away.\" All of a sudden, a huge tree shoots up from the ground and slams into Chrell, whose hold over his four captives and Wiccan is loosened.</p> <p>Instinctively, Nico starts formulating a plan as soon as she lands. She tells Victor and Chase to help Tommy and Billy. She and Karolina will... Nico can't even complete her sentence before Karolina is up and pouring her rainbow-colored energies on Chrell. She is furious and swears at him. \"Leave my fiancé <em>alone</em>. Do you hear me?!\" she cries. \"And I am not a tramp, you chauvinistic $*@!!\" Molly is impressed. She didn't even know Karolina knew words like that. Chase is awestruck at her ferocity. Victor attacks X'iv. \"Let them go, lagarto!\" he warns, as he slams into her torso. X'iv responds with a solid right hand punch which knocks Victor backwards. Chase uses his new gauntlets to fire missiles at her. Chrell gets up and informs Xavin that her choice was poor, but it's no surprise to him. She was never a particularly good student. He begins speaking in Skrullian. \"Oh, no!\" exclaims Molly. \"He's a parseltongue!\" Nico asks Xavin for a translation. \"Enough games. Kill them all,\" she replies.</p> <p>They look up to see that X'iv has taken to the air and is preparing to strike. Xavin asks Nico which part of 'run away' did she not understand before. Nico quips that she's all for trying again. As X'iv prepares to fire, Hulkling puts himself between them and takes the brunt of the blast. Xavin then dashes towards Chrell and asks Dorrek to stay alive. X'iv grabs a sai and hurls it at Teddy, but he manages to avoid it and he asks Nico if she's okay. Did she hit her? Nico's cheek is cut, and she replies that she is, but it's only fun and games when she gets hurt. She utters the magic words, \"When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge.\" The staff shoots from her chest and into her hand.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Xavin and Chrell begin their battle. Xavin fires a burst of flame at him, but, as he did in the past, he avoids it easily. He warns Xavin that Dorrek will die, and that any Skrulls foolish enough to believe in him will see the truth. Their 'savior' will never be found. He protects himself against shards of invisible forcefield thrown by Xavin and then becomes entangled as they both use their elasticity to try and place each other in a stranglehold. Chrell grins as he believes he is superior. He warns Xavin that the invasion is done. This is as it is written. No Skrull or man can change that. He attacks Xavin with spikes of forcefield energy that hurt, and follows this up by punching Xavin in the face with his 'Thing' fist which is now on fire. Xavin falls to the ground, hurt. She tells Chrell that she doesn't want to fight him, but Chrell replies that he would hardly call this a fight. She still can't even use her powers concurrently. How is she going to beat him?</p> <p>Chrell picks Xavin up by the throat and holds her high above him. Xavin tells him that she is a Skrull. She knows his weakness and will exploit it. \"And what is my weakness?\" asks Chrell, defiantly. Xavin replies that his beliefs are empty and filled with hate, yet <em>she</em> believes in her friends. From behind, Karolina attacks Chrell once again and he is forced to drop Xavin.</p> <p>Elsewhere, X'iv blasts Old Lace with a beam of energy fired from her eyes as Chase leaps at Wiccan, saving him from a blast of darkforce. Speed grabs Molly and Klara and deposits them safely several hundred miles away. Molly shakes her fist as he returns to the battleground. Klara is in awe at the sight presented before her. \"Mr. President!\" she exclaims. Speed rushes back to Manhattan just in time to get hit by a darkforce blast from X'iv. Nico is winded by a burst of light from X'iv's other hand. Chase is hurt by a billy club. X'iv is using her powers well. Hulkling punches X'iv, but she gets up quickly and warns him that his friends will not save him. Their powers dwarf theirs. All he has to do is die. She attacks him with her sais, but Teddy replies, as he tries to avoid being pierced, that he is the son of Princess Annelle and the Kree named Mar-Vell. It is his destiny to save the Skrull Empire and to unite their people. He tells her that she knows the prophecies. She has read them. But there is only one truth and it is he. \"I was chosen by out God. He speaks to me,\" he adds, \"And he told me he does <em>not</em> love you.\" X'iv's eyes widen upon hearing this, and this momentary lapse in concentration allows Dorrek to headbutt her which knocks her out cold. \"Sucker,\" says Teddy as he stands over her defeated body.</p> <p>Teddy asks if everyone's okay. Chase can't believe that the Skrull's secret alien weakness was getting head-butted. Nico asks where Xavin is and Billy asks where Karolina is. Teddy turns and sees Karolina and Xavin in a fierce battle with Commander Chrell. \"Over there... fighting my fight,\" replies Teddy.\"</p> <p>Chrell warns them that they can send a thousand children. It will not matter. Xavin asks Karolina to keep pouring it on. Chrell creates a forcefield to hold them off, and Xavin begins to sweat. Karolina asks what' wrong. Xavin replies that Chrell is going nova. They have to get out of there, now! Chrell's body becomes hotter and hotter. He tells Xavin that despite her failure, '<em>he</em>' still loves her. Xavin surrounds Chrell with a forcefield and struggles as the strain takes its toll. She must hold the field in place. Chrell's face suddenly shows concern and he asks what Xavin is doing. Her powers are not strong enough to beat him. As he goes nova, he cries out before exploding into a pile of Skrullian bones.</p> <p>Xavin releases the forcefield and collapses, only to be held up by Karolina. \"He was right,\" she gasps, \"My weakness beat him. I cannot use my powers together... but it has made me stronger... individually... I did it... I... saved...\" Karolina lays her down and hopes that she is okay. Xavin turns to her and says she is better for seeing how scared she was for her. Now Karolina knows that Xavin is okay, she asks how she could tell Nico to <em>leave</em> her like that. \"Don't ever do that again, do you understand me?\"</p> <p>Watching them, Dorrek reckons that was kinda harsh, but Billy just says she was worried about him. \"Can we never come to New York again?\" Chase asks Nico. \"Done,\" she replies. Karolina asks what now. Billy tells them that they have to get back to Times Square. The rest of their team is there and they have to help. Teddy tells Xavin that she risked her life for him, despite him turning his back on all his responsibilities. She still believes in him. Why? Xavin tells him that to <em>not</em> believe in him; in the savior and the uniter, is to not believe in hope. She chooses to believe in hope.</p> <p>Teddy kneels before her and tells Xavin that she is his savior. He thanks her. Nico places her hand on Billy's shoulder and tells him that they are the super heroes. Do they have a handbook for this? What's the next step in the 'alien invasion' chapter? Billy asks her to get out of there. They're heading back in. Nico thinks not. No more running. They're <em>in</em> this. Billy replies that it's not running. It's prevention of suicide. He asks her to take a look at her team. Even their dinosaur is trashed. Besides, he adds, if they lose, they've gotta come and save them. Nico resigns herself to acknowledging that Billy is right. She asks him to win. They've lost enough friends.</p><p><br/></p>",

Fighting his way through the natural dangers of his barbaric homeland has been a welcome change from the mind games and treachery Conan found in the cities of the East, but there's an unfortunate lesson in treachery in store for Conan here, too. In a Richard Corben flashback sequence, Connacht--Conan's grandfather--seems to have found a role for himself working in a busy city, but as the old saying goes, \"Fleas will find a dog . . . and trouble will find a Cimmerian.\"</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The Anti-Life Equation has infected Gotham City, turning friend, foe and family into mindless slaves of Darkseid, and the might of the Spear of Destiny has left The Spectre powerless. Can The Question find the answer to restoring hope inside the one being capable of saving the world?</i></p><p>The issue begins with Mercy retelling what god gave all of us, the choice to sin an the choice not to. Those who sinned were cast away and those who didn't were saved. Then she comes to her senses as the Anti-Life controlled citizens of Gotham slam onto the three heroes. Spectre,and Mercy huddled together in a force field created by the Spectre. As Mercy tells how she died Sister Clarice she attempts to calm the citizens, yet to no avail. She comments that it should have worked and Spectre tells her it happened to him when he confronted Libra that its God's idea of a joke. Mercy barks at Spectre telling him that God doesn't joke with life. Commenting to herself that she speaks to him with authority she does not feel.</p><p>Outside the Question tries to defend herself from Batwoman. The woman she once loved under the control of Darkseids Anti-Life equation, Batwoman continues to beat the life out of Question. Question tries to beg an reason with Kate(Batwoman) but to no avail, she strikes Question down slamming her fist into her back. The pain is almost too much for Question. All the time Mercy can feel the pain from Question, and soon the fight is stopped with Spectre screaming \"ENOUGH!\" as he blasts Batwoman. Spectre believes if god wont allow him to restore Kate then she shall be ended by his hands. Question jumps in front of Batwoman telling him that she cant control the evil she is committing that she is under control of the Anti-Life, Spectre comments thats even worse. Mercy does not want to see anymore bloodshed and she teleports Question,Spectre and herself out of the area for the safety of them an the ones around them.</p><p>Cain and his followers continue their trek towards Spectre, Cain stops and comments on the work he has done already that his father would be proud. His followers commenting on what he has already done, he tells them that its almost over that this is nothing that awaits once he is revenged upon god.</p><p>Back with Spectre an company he comments that this is what God wanted. That he has abandoned them, leaving them powerless to do anything against what they are fighting against. Soon the Questions wounds become too much for her an Spectre points out the damage, soon afterward Mercy places her hand on Question and heals her. Spectre then grows angered that god allows Mercy to heal Question while his power is bit by bit whittling away, that he was unable to stop Libra because god wouldn't allow it. That why was she spared and not his brother Jake.</p><p>Soon more people come to the church they are in looking for help, as Question helps them in Mercy in her human form gasps in surprise. Spectre now in human form comments that the people outside who are being controlled are stopped cause they are protected, but Mercy interjects saying that they are waiting. Spectre asks waiting for what ?. Question tells them both she already told them, it was all in the Crime bible. The people are waiting for Cain that he has the spear and is coming for Spectre. Mercy continues with what Question was saying, telling Spectre that Cain is after him because he was the one who took him down that Cain is coming back for revenge....revenge upon god by killing Spectre. Mercy finally seeing something is up with their powers pointing out three men in the church asking if Spectre feels anything if god is pointing them out, when Spectre says no she tells him that they were the three that killed her. She walks up to them turning into Mercy asking if they remember her to look at what they did to her. They plead to her telling her sorry and asking for forgiveness, she replies \"I don't know how to.\" then Questions gaze turns to the door as she tells them \"HE'S HERE\".</p><p>Cain is outside goading Spectre to come out an stop being a coward, to come out an fight him. Surrounded by his people who worship him along with the ones controlled by the Anti-Life. Soon Spectre does as he is asked an comes out fists swinging, Cain laughs at his attempts at fighting telling him he is using his fists when he has great power at his disposal. That Spectre knows nothing of vengeance and gouging out Spectre's eye out, as Spectre writhes in pain Cain tells him \"I birthed murder...allow me to demonstrate.\" And plunges the Spear of Destiny into Spectre.</p>",

As he fiddles with a pair of pliers, firey laser shoots from the glove, destroying the radio. This surprises Chase, but Molly appears at that moment asking what he's doing. Although Chase attempts to hide the out-of-control glove, Molly picks Chase up and carries him to the Runaways' team meeting.</p><p>(moments later)</p><p>Carrying Chase over her head, Molly enters the lounge. Nico begins the meeting with her first issue - the Majesdanians are returning, seeing as their ship must have went to pick them up. Sitting in the middle of the living room is vaDanti, who won't cooperate with the Runaways. He reminds Karolina that she cannot hide from Majesdane's soldiers. They tracked her across light years. Navigating a planet is nothing.</p><p>Victor tells him that they don't want to hide; they want to avoid any more fighting and work out a peaceful resolution between them and Karolina. Nico immediately attacks vaDanti with a ream of questions; she wants to know where they are and when they will arrive, whether he can communicate with them and what they can do to stop them from attacking. Her final question is, \"What they we do to avoid a fight?\" Smiling maliciously, vaDanti barks \"Surrender,\" immediately angering Chase. Victor and Xavin restrain him. Karolina shouts for everyone to stop it; they're not getting anywhere with violence and anger.</p><p>Karolina begins to speak, but this doesn't get vaDanti to cooperate. Finally, Chase suggests they should just load up the Leapfrog and find the Majesdanians themselves; they can get the jump on them. Xavin, however, suggests she can make a speech and bring truce between Karolina and the Majesdanians. Molly suggests they build a fort. Klara suggests she give them flowers. Nico suggests a spell to make vaDanti speak... but a silent Karolina watches as the others all make suggestions and excuses for her, and suggests her own solution: give herself up.</p><p>Finally, vaDanti agrees with her - he tells her she is finally making sense. This causes the other Runaways to angrily turn to him and tell him to shut up. But fed up, Chase storms off for work. Xavin stalks off to make her speech - she will save them with diplomacy. Molly and Klara angrily run out to build their fort. This only leaves Nico, Victor, Karolina and Old Lace with vaDanti. Nico is stunned with how the others just walked away. It is at this point where even Old Lace leaves the room. \"Perfect,\" groans Nico. Karolina leaves as well.</p><p>(the Antarctic)</p><p>deHalle is freezing. A penguin stands there, as if it's interested in what she is doing there. The spacecraft appears above her and her powers kick in. With a beautiful rainbow lightshow, she takes off and enters the craft from underneath, rejoining the General who is at the controls. He asks if she is okay. deHalle replies that she is fine, but can't wait to get her hands on that little witch. The General says they have one more stop and then she will get her chance.</p><p>(Malibu)</p><p>Molly and Klara take their suitcase to build a fort on a hill in Malibu. Lying on the grass, Klara asks why the sky is so brown - back in 1907 New York, it wasn't this dirty. Molly assumes it is pollution. Molly looks out over the sea and says that any minute now, she's gonna see way more than pollution up there - the Majesdanians will be arriving, but they will be safe in their own fort, like the second raptor in Jurassic Park. As Molly crushes a rock into powder, a smiling Klara looks up at the sky. \"Ships that sail in the sky. Parks filled with dinosaurs. I'm never going to get used to this century.\"</p><p>(KZIT)</p><p>At KZIT radio station, Chase arrives for work to find that Val Rhymin is exhausted. Val, who doesn't seem to be in the right mind, asks Chase to come closer to his face. Val asks him to do a favor for him. Chase is eager to hear. After a long pause, Val tells Chase to jump out the window.</p><p>Chase, however, stands up and laughs, assuming Val was joking. At this point, a call comes in from \"Mother\". Val suddenly jerks alert and active and orders Chase to pick up his dry cleaning. Depressed, Chase resigns himself to the task and departs. Val says that if he passes this test, then next time he might try something a little harder, like washing his car. He gets back on the phone to Mother and apologies. He then asks, \"So... Mother... what do you know about zombies?\"</p><p>(the African plains)</p><p>The Majesdanian ship arrives in Africa to pick up vaRikk, whose also picked up a lizard he decided to nickname \"deHalley\", after deHalle. The General tells them to buckle up; he wants to get back to Los Angeles as quickly as possible.</p><p>(Malibu)</p><p>On the beach, the sun sets as Xavin (in her young adult male form) is at a beach party with their neighbors. Nico, shocked that Xavin could be partying at a time like this approaches Xavin, acting as though she is his daughter. As the neighbours watch interested, Nico asks Xavin if she should come back inside the house - they have their \"guests\" arriving. Xavin, deliberately acting dumb, pretends not to know what Nico is talking about. As Nico begins to get infuriated, Xavin tells her she already wrote a speech. Nico can't believe that she's just going to sit there and do nothing. Xavin, covering her eyes from the neighbours, reveals her bright vivid Skrull eyes and tells Nico that has her own plan, and Xavin has hers. Nico storms off, angry.</p><p>Nico heads back to the house calling for Molly and Klara who don't respond. Victor, meeting up with her, reminds her they are building a fort. Chase is at work. Xavin is having a beach party. Molly and Klara are playing. Karolina is writing a letter of surrender... and any second now, a Majesdanian warship is going to arrive and blow their house off the map. Nico doesn't understand why anyone isn't working together... they're falling apart. Going in different directions...and finally, a shocked Victor figures out what their problem is.</p><p>Inside the house, vaDanti watches them through the large windows. With no one to watch over him, he uses his energy powers to destroy his metal bindings. His wrist band beeps and something gluttonous spills out.</p><p>Victor tells Nico that he understands what their problem is. He knows why everyone's acting strange and <b>scatter</b>ed... and Nico finally gets it. Her scatter spell that sent the Majesdanians over the world had side-effects: it appears to have emotionally scattered the Runaways...</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>This issue marks the first mention of \"Mother\", who would actually appear in issue #7 (February 2009). In this issue, something gluttonous and slimy spills from vaDanti's wrist band - this is the infamous bubble that will be the focus of the next issue, #4 (November 2008).</p><p>The 1960 film 'Psycho' is referened by Chase, while the 1993 film 'Jurassic Park' is referenced by Molly. Rocky Balboa from the 'Rocky' films is referenced by Xavin. Chase notes that Val has a Porsche.</p></div></div>",

But this Spidey isn't Peter Parker--it's Ben Reilly, the Spider-Clone! And Wolverine's claws are made of bone, not adamantium! It's radical...it's extreme...and if we coulda put a chromium cover on it, we would have! Put down your pogs and pick this up if only to feast your eyes on Mario Alberti's art! It'll make you say \"Cowabunga, dude!\"</em></p><p>A few years ago, the X-Men are up against Mr. Sinister once again. He leaves before the battle is over. The X-Men search his place for any clues to his next hiding place. They find a box that may give them a lead and allow them to return a favor.</p><p>In the city, Spider-Man (actually Ben Reilly, the Scarlet Spider when he took over for Spidey) is chasing Slyde. He is stopped by Iceman. As \"Spider-Man\" is about to leave, Storm reminds him of when he came to them about Kraven and Sinister's team-up. He says he remembers it but Wolverine knows he's lying. He has no choice but to tell them that he's not the same Spider-Man he knows. He tells them the one they know was a clone (that's what he and Peter Parker were lead to believe at the time). The X-Men tell him that they found some notes of data exchange between Sinister and Miles Warren (the dude that cloned Spider-Man). What concerns Ben Reilly is there are notes on Cletus Kasady, also known as Carnage. They plan on paying him a visit.</p><p>At the Ravencroft Institue, Sinister is already visiting Carnage. He wants to make a deal with him. Before anything can happen, the X-Men and Scarlet Spider arrive. A fight begins, Carnage bites Wolverine's bone claws, Sinister gets upset. He tries controling their mind but finds Spider-Man resisting him. He pushes further and Ben pushes back with the memories of his life. Sinister is disgusted and calls him a \"mockery of life.\" After he leaves and Carnage is put on ice, Ben wonders what he meant by that. Cyclops tells him not to listen to Sinister. Spidey asks Wolverine if he can tell the difference but is told they smell the same. As far as he's concerned, he is Spider-Man.</p><p>Back at Sinister's (latest) lab, he seems to have just about perfected the sample he took from Kasady.</p>",

Will his quest for the truth unleash an even greater danger upon those around him? The only way to make sure it doesn't is by facing off against his greatest enemy - himself!  </i><br /><i>Plus: Gambit has just been hired for the biggest job of his young life - a heist at the Weapon X facility! Bonne chance, mon ami!   </i><br /> <br /><u>Note</u>: Issue includes a cover gallery for the volume, as well as a pinup by Michael Ryan. Also includes a preview for <a data-ref-id=\"4000-151135\" href=\"/black-panther-the-deadliest-of-the-species-part-one/4000-151135/\"> Black Panther #1</a>.<br /> <br /><h3>Synopsis<br /></h3><h4>Part 3, The Devil Inside<br /></h4>After a training session in the Danger Room, Wolverine meets once again with Xavier to sort out more of his memories. Xavier explains that Wolverine will be going it alone this time. After fashioning a special helmet, Wolverine is back in his memories. His memory self (Weapon X) is taken into the facilities and Wolverine follows. He wanders away and finds the doctors. He realizes they can't talk because he has no memory of where he finds them. He searches out Weapon X to see what his memories really have to share. <br /> <br />Weapon X escapes and finds Wolverine. The two begin fighting and Wolverine realizes that one must give in to the other. Wolverine does so and incorporates himself into Weapon X. This allows him to see his memories first-hand. He goes berserk. He hacks and slashes his way through the Weapon X facility before he finds the female doctor that had shown him kindness. The two escape until Weapon X finds the man responsible for the experimentation. Weapon X attacks and Wolverine is brought to his senses in reality when the X-Men are having to pry him off Xavier. After a few moments, Xavier thinks the danger has passed. Wolverine feels differently and leaves the X-Men alone with Xavier. <br /> <br />Later, Wolverine meets with Xavier and asks him to erase all the horrible memories the two have drawn out. Xavier refuses, stating that those memories are proof that Wolverine has grown. The two compromise: Xavier will block those memories out until Wolverine is more capable of reliving them. Wolverine suggests that those blocks never be taken down. He is shown later as a man that feels as if he is forgetting something. It's a normal feeling by now. He decides to get on with life. <br /> <br /><h4>The Job<br /></h4>A young Gambit infiltrates the Weapon X facility to retrieve a lost diary. In doing so, he stumbles upon a room that houses tanks filled with humanoids. Shocked, he backs into a series of crashes. Guards confront him but get called away to deal with the Weapon X escape before anything can happen. Gambit finds the diary and leaves during the assault of the experimented-on mutant. Outside, Gambit figures any diary found in that devilish facility deserves to burn. He burns the book.  <br /> <br />Back in New Orleans, Gambit admits that he couldn't find the diary. The owner, Nathaniel Essex, forgives the charge and pays the Theives' Guild. Back at his labs, Mr. Sinister plans for future uses of Gambit.",

Her detective instincts may have led her to the truth, but when the restless dead stage a bloody revolt, it'll take much more than that to survive long enough to do anything about it.</i></p><p>The riots are just building over the two policemen accused of abuse of power and killing a civilian. They are being held for their own safety at the headquarters and the new commander isn't happy about it. The force is stretched thin trying to contain the demonstration.</p><p>Meanwhile Alice,Peter and three heavily armed riot police fly into Mots Island and enter the facility looking for Brendan Glenn, the head of the research team using the facility for research. Alice and the 2 policemen head into the building while Peter stays with the controller.</p><p>Descending into the facilities most dangerous area Alice warns the men not to remove their gear as it will protect them from electrical attacks while she has a brass grid etched into her skull that acts as a personal Faraday cage. The walls are decayed and the lighting sparse down here. Alice deploys outriders (3 floating probes with sensors and lights to go out ahead of them), the maintenance is poor and the local suppressor hasn't been able to do its job in the lower levels. the walls in one section have been warped into the shape of a massive skull.</p><p>they come to a door and as Alice looks at it it opens by itself and the voice floats out\" You Came, You Found Me!\". Inside the room is a skull and ribcage surrounded by blue-light and thick twists of cable. In the same room the police find a bio-hazard bin with the remains of Yani's in them and the bodies of two exected contact works. Glenn is in the back of the room holding a pistol.</p><p>Alice questions Glenn about his motives for killing Yanis and releasing the monsters when no-one had any idea what they were doing until then. Glenn tells them that a voice in his head told him to do it. Glenn stands and revels he is a zombie with the back of his head a gaping hole Alice immediately realizes he is a puppet and this must be a jail break.</p><p>They rush for the door only for one policeman to have his head removed by a massive green spiked humanoid monster. Glenn explains he was a Brazilian drugs lord's enforcer who they bonded a million razors into his ghost form. While the spider-like one,his legs are knives, is a man killed by a mob of vigilante parents and those people always come back as spiders. the spider kills on more of the men. Lastly a skeletal child who can project terrible images into peoples minds attacks the last man. Glenn talks about the first test an innocent man charged with many murders who was trained to kill at long range but failed to work as his ghost was preoccupied with explaining his innocence. Alice tells him it wasn't a failure as it killed many people at the slums.</p><p>The last floating device identifies its self as the Soul Eater and fires at the razor-blade man at Alice's command. the figure explodes sending tri-pointed razors in all direction. Soul eater has a 30 second recharge time and they flee in the confusion. Alice orders the controller to open the failsafe as flood the facility with river water to neutralize the blue-light. She sends the policeman out while she tackles the knife legged spider, with a power source it can survive the waters. She returns to fire the soul eater but Campbell turns back and fires on the drone knocking out the soul eater, he uses his last round to kill himself. the child ghost controlled him to do it. Alice drives a suppressor spike into its skill and takes it down.</p><p>She races for the exit but the ladder is broken and with seconds to spare before the flood water hits her she confesses to Peter that i was her that leaked the footage of the corrupt policemen and started the riot after all.</p>",

A major new series by Warren Ellis, the writer who reinvented science fiction in comics, in the alternate-world style of the award-winning Ministry Of Space and Aetheric Mechanics - a retro-punk 'future of the past' where spaceships still belched smoke and arguments were still settled with laser pistols. Mary Raven's asking questions about the death of her father Rock, here in the interzone settlement in the middle of Earth's last spaceport. Enough questions that she's about to find herself on the wrong end of a couple of ray guns, trapped in a place where no-one cares about murder and the only real currency is fear. Today might be Mary Raven's last day on Earth, and all she has to defend herself is her daddy's old gun and a secret no-one wants told. Ignition City is an on-going color epic told in a 5 issue series featuring the art of Aetheric Mechanics' Gianluca Pagliarani.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p>BASIC PLOT:</p><p><i>Chun-li &amp; crew run across both the deadly assassin Gen and kung-fu movie sensation Fei Long! What clues will they reveal about Sagat and Shadaloo’s latest caper? It’s Hong Kong action all the way as Chun-li demonstrates why she deserves to be called a Street Fighter legend!</i></p><p>DETAILED SYNOPSIS:</p><p>The issue opens in Hong Kong, ten years before the events of the previous two issues. A group of toughs, including a chinese man wearing glasses, are selling a truckload of drugs to a skeezy looking guy in a dark alleyway. Skeezy tells Glasses that the word on the street is that someone has hired a psycho to kill him, but Glasses just points to his massive bodyguard, Mongo, standing behind him and says that whoever the hired killer is, he isn't concerned.</p><p>Suddenly, stepping out of the shadows, an old man stands before them. He tells them he will be glad to give them the name. \"Gen.\" He says, identifying himself.</p><p>Gen then begins his attack, taking down every one - Mongo included - that tries to stop him. Finally, he stands before the man he has been hired to kill, and, with a poke to his throat, completes the task.</p><p>The time frame returns to the present, and Gen and Dorai sit within the restaurant from the previous issue. Dorai tells Gen that he is there on business, and with a smile Gen replies that he always thought what kept their friendship alive was the fact that they didn't talk \"business.\"</p><p>Dorai agrees, but says that he's desperate for leads. He knows something big is about to go down, and hoped Gen's old connections might be of help. Gen tells him that he can't help him because he has removed himself from that world ever since something occured which he is ashamed of, and which robbed him of THE KILLING INTENT. He says that in his line of work, being without that is like being a tiger without teeth and claws. The restaurant is now his life, Gen says, and while he has heard something big is imminent, he is out of the loop and he knows not what that something is.</p><p>Thanking him, Dorai leaves, saying that he is glad they are no longer on opposite sides of the law. Gen agrees and says that Dorai and Chun Li are always welcome. As Dorai leaves, however, Gen spies another car, following him.</p><p>The next day, Chun Li and Po Lin have been following some Shadaloo-linked Triads, when they finally make their move and rob a laundrymat. After a brief exchange of bullets, Po Lin has handcuffed one suspect who has taken a slug in the shoulder, and Chun Li is working on handcuffing the other one. Demanding to know what Sagat is up to, Po Lin starts choking her suspect, and Chun Li, worried that Po Lin is going to kill the man, lets her attention wander a bit too much. Her suspect manages to pull a weapon and escape under a hail of bullets.</p><p>Later that day, Fei Long is preparing to open a new exhibit which contains the largest collection of terracotta warriors outside of the China mainland, when suddenly he is challenged by a man in the crowd, who says that Fei Long is not a true martial artist, but a clown performing in front of the cameras. He challenges Fei Long, declaring that he will take him down in front of everyone and expose him as a fake.</p><p>The police are called and Dorai is told to report to the scene of the fight. Before he can get there, however, Fei Long has already finished things with a flaming DRAGON ARC KICK, knocking his opponent cold.</p><p>Fei Long tells Dorai that he won't be pressing charges - this sort of thing happens to him all the time - but Dorai says he'll still have to come downtown and fill out a report.</p><p>Meanwhile, two Shadaloo toughs take pictures of the scene, one telling the other that Sagat won't be happy that there are cops hanging out at the museum. Later on the two thugs are showing the pictures to Sagat, who identifies Dorai. Sagat says that Dorai infiltrated Shadaloo and shut down the arms pipeline between Hong Kong and Beijing before he was discovered, greatly displeasing Bison. Worried that Dorai may have discovered their plans, Sagat assigns five armed men to watch him.</p><p>Later, Chun Li and Po Lin sit together at a restaurant. Po Lin apologizes to Chun Li, saying that it was her fault that one of the suspects escaped, and they were almost killed. Chun Li says that she understands - she doesn't know how she's react if she lost her father.</p><p>Po Lin holds up the uniform that they confiscated from the suspect and says that she hopes Dorai will be able to identify it. Arriving right then, Dorai does just that, saying that the museum guards were wearing that uniform. The uniform also triggers the realization that the work schedule found on the Shadaloo agents in issue #1 corresponds to the guard shift change at the museum. \"They're planning on stealing the Terracotta statues!\" Dorai exclaims.</p><p>In a garage across the street from the restaurant, Shadaloo thugs with high tech listening devices overhear Dorai's conversation with Chun Li and Po Lin and report it to Sagat. Sagat says that the plan is already in motion and orders his men to take out all three of them.</p><p>Back in the restaurant, Chun Li sees the telltale red dot of a sniper appear on her father's chest, and puts herself in the line of fire...</p>",

Join the next generation of X-Men as legendary X-Scribe Chris Claremont and amazing artist Jonboy Meyers spin a tale of young adventurers coming into their own.</i></p><p>*<strong><em>SPOILERS*</em></strong></p><p> Sophie is brought back to hero hq for interrogation and Skanda and beast meet again. We learn Skanda is a god much like thor and also that India is where beast and Cecelia got series. He ask the tema and sati to find out what they can as him and hank interrogate Sophie. She protest but her father has already been contacted and he has no problem with it. The team checks in on Megan who is recovering well even though no one knows how she could be taken down so easily. She retorts her mom wont be happy while beats says he did well. Her and oli talk as she confides that kalima breached all her defense as if they were nonexistent and she’s unsure if she will be able to help if they must face her again. Oli says no matter what he will always save her and the two kiss.</p><p>No-Name feels useless as she realizes that she never was as she thought the team “brain”. Rico shares his history with Sophie which mirrors his granddad and her fathers, they were friends and the ended enemies (he doesn’t explain why she would kiss him though). They were both thirteen year old wonders of the world going to MIT for a doctorate at that age. After Sophie’s experiments end badly he protects them with his powers but both get booted and his dad send him to Xavier’s and she apparently returned home to dad. Sati visits Megan and touches her why? She does not know but says she often does things she cant explain but they always work out right.</p><p>To get some answer they change into civilian clothes to check where Sophie got her equipment. Megan remains in telepathic communion with them all incase of danger. The interrogation does not go well as Sophie sticks to her story while Beast looks on. The kids arrive at the black market and Rico finds a man who knows the details of Sophie’s transaction but wont spill the beans. He wonders if megan can pick his brain to which oli says she’s not up to it. No-Name then talks to the man and is able to get the information and the address they need, Sophie was lying and they now know her base of operations.</p><p>They get to the warehouse and find robot parts to match those they faced before. At this point Sophie shows a hologram of them to beats and skanda saying the kids are better than she expected. She transforms into kalima and unleashes a spell that causes skanda and bets to battle each other, Megan tries to stop this but is affected by the spell as well.</p><p>In the warehouse kalima teleports in and cast the same spell turning the team on each other. Only oli and Sati are unaffected he reaches for her and absorbs her power, he gets flashes of varying images he cant understand and transforms his team including Megan into Indians and teleports them in different directions. Kalima is furious and demands to know what has happened. Sati does not know but kalima says the children and their souls will still be hers and they will all suffer. Sati meanwhile thinks yes they will suffer but they will win!</p>",

Anyway, point being-this issue explodes with excitement and ramps up the danger to lead us into…</i> <br /> <br /><i>Summary </i><br />Zartan stabs Cover Girl through the chest and before General Hawk can react Storm Shadow thrusts his sword into Hawk's gut.  Baroness takes the briefcase and the three Cobra soldiers make their exit from the bloody scene.  General Hawk staggers to press the silent alarm, while Cover Girl lays across from him dead.   <br /> <br />The alarm at the Pit blazes and the Joes all react as Cobra Vipers raid their base.  Duke blocks Baroness and she asks him if he could kill her as she walks closer towards him, though he hesitates to shoot.  A viper prepares to shoot Duke but Ripcord tackles him and the shot blows up the walkway that Baroness and Duke were on instead.  Ripcord pulls his gun out on Baroness and tells her to freeze, but Storm Shadow intercepts him and cuts his gun in two.  Storm Shadow prepares to slash Ripcord but Snake Eyes appears and counter his attacks.  Baroness gathers herself together but is tackled down by Scarlett.  The two women fight it out and Scarlett uses an invisibility cloak to disappear from Baroness' sight.  Unable to see her attacker, Baroness is easily subdued by Scarlett in her invisible cloaking.  Baroness quickly grabs some type of liquid near by and splashes it onto Scarlett disrupting her invisibility cloak advantage.  Scarlett momentarily stunned by this is now overtaken by Baroness.  Duke rushes towards Baroness and Scarlett just as Storm Shadow arrive on his jet pack to pick up Baroness for their escape.  Before Baroness and Storm Shadow leave, Baroness whacks Duke in the face with the briefcase and then they take off.   <br /> <br />Scarlett is alone in the bathroom looking at the bruises she got from Baroness choking her.  Ripcord walks in on her and they talk. <br /> <br />In a flashback, a young Snake Eyes sneaks into someone's home to steal some food to eat.  A young Storm Shadow calls out thief and attacks the young Snake Eyes.  An older man comes in and tells Storm Shadow to back off their young intruder and offers young Snake Eyes some help.  The old man becomes Snake Eye's martial arts master and quickly becomes his favorite pupil.  A scorned Storm Shadow is seemingly accused of murdering their master as it is seen that Storm Shadow's blade was used to kill their master.   <br /> <br />Scarlett and the other Joes are performing an autopsy on one of the dead Vipers that attacked the Pit where she discovers that the body has been imbued with nano mites.  Ripcord deduces that McCullen probably set them up when he asked them to open the case for him.  Breaker informs them that he has tracked the Baroness and they suit up and leave. <br /> <br />A tiny flashback reveals that Duke feels responsible for the death of Rex because he sent Rex into a house to search for something. <br /> <br />Baroness arrives in a lab in Paris where she tells her husband Leon to do her a favor.  After activating the warheads for her, Baroness kisses him and Storm Shadow stabs Leon and leaves him to die.  The Joes arrive onto the scene but they are too late Storm Shadow and Baroness are already on the move.  Snake Eyes leaps onto the Cobra's get away vehicle while the others pursue them in another vehicle.  Storm Shadow and Baroness manages to get Snake Eyes off the top of their vehicle but are now tailed by Duke and Ripcord who are in accelerator suits.  After a fancy chase scene, Storm Shadow and Baroness gets into a wreck with an oncoming train and decide to take the chase on foot.  Duke goes after Baroness who has the kill switch while Ripcord goes after Storm Shadow who has the warhead.  Storm Shadow manages to get a shot at the Eiffel Tower and leaps out the window before Ripcord can catch him.  The warhead hits the Eiffel Tower and it is consumed with nano mites which eat away at its construct.  Duke chases Baroness onto the roof of a building.  Baroness spots Storm Shadow in a helicopter and leaps out towards the helicopter.  With the help of the accelerator suit, Duke manages to leap on board with them as well.  Duke manages to hit the kill switch after a brief struggle and stops the nano mites from doing further damage.  Baroness congratulates Duke for being able to stop the attack on Paris, and Storm Shadow knocks Duke out.",

            "description": "<i>SOULFIRE'S STORIED MYTHOLOGY CONTINUES TO GROW WITHIN THE PAGES OF NEW WORLD ORDER!<br/><br/>Magic flourishes once again. Unbelievable power courses through the lands... and A NEW WORLD ORDER is at hand. An epic story about the future of humans surviving in a world of magic, steering towards their own salvation...or doom. The next exciting chapter of the SOULFIRE mythos continues here as a host of new characters, and a few familiar ones, chart a course through the dark and undiscovered futuristic landscape of the planet.<br/><br/>In this issue, hell breaks loose as Cruz and his posse square off against Erich and the skinheads in an all-out gang war! While Cruz once again proves his loyalty to his roots, and the street way of life, the same cannot be said for his deceptive cousin, Manny. Meanwhile, Cole shockingly makes a 'deep' discovery about how Blackjack and Saxon have been able to track him so easily, and he takes out his aggression the only way he knows how-viciously and violently! Yet, even his sadistic measures will not be enough to take on Rainier's newest deadly weapon, as well as his grand scheme to annihilate all of the resurfaced beings of magic! Brought to you by the acclaimed international art team of Francisco Herrera and Leonardo Olea, with words provided by scribe J. T. Krul, SOULFIRE: NEW WORLD ORDER will leave you clamoring for more!<br/><br/>Plus, this 3rd issue also includes part 3 of a special 4 page back-up story brought to you by the upcoming SOULFIRE Volume 2 creative team of J.T. Krul, Marcus To, Saleem Crawford and Beth Sotelo. This bonus story continues throughout the entire SOULFIRE: NEW WORLD ORDER series, providing you with two incredible SOULFIRE tales for the price of one!!</i>",

They then find themselves falling out of the sky and into the ocean below. Despite the efforts Redwing and Lockheed to save them, the Pet Avengers plunge into the ocean. <br/> <br/>But after doing so, they are saved, being encased in bubbles by Sea turtles, local guardians of Atlantis. Throg and the Pet Avengers ask the Turtles if they can help them find one of the remaining Infinity Gems. The turtles agree to help them find it... only to lead them right to the sleeping giant Giganto. <br/> <br/>Thanks to Hairball's scream of terror of actually being in the water, Giganto awakens and then swallows the Pet Avengers with one gulp. <br/> <br/>So they now sit on the tongue of the large creature trying to find a way to get out, as they do so, they discover one of the remaining infinity gems as Ms. Lion accidentally stumbles upon it.  <br/> <br/>After this, Lockjaw then manages to get the strength to actually teleport them from the creatures mouth and onto the lawn of the white house, where the last Infinity Gem is located, (around the collar of Bo Obama, the first dog).  <br/> <br/>Throg then devises a plan to get them inside the White house to find the Infinity Gem. Dragging the exhausted and heavy Lockjaw with them, they get inside by traveling inside a box that gets transported inside the White House. <br/> <br/>So they then drag Lockjaw as the go through the White house, even dragging him a flight of stairs to get to their goal. But as they do, they encounter Bo Obama on the stairway, seeing that he has the gem they're looking for. Bo Obama runs off and they give chase, only to find that Bo has been grabbed by Thanos! Who demands that they hand over the gems. What will the Pet Avengers do now? Read the next issue to find out!",

The occasional death at Herogasm isn't that unusual, but how one member of Fantastico checks out is nothing short of spectacular. In the resultant chaos the Boys make their move- on a target that may not be all he seems. Hughie, meanwhile, runs smack into Black Noir in the worst possible way, while Jack From Jupiter spills a few more secrets to A-Train. And speaking of secrets, what does the man from Vought-American want with Vic the Veep...?</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>With THE HOOD and MR. NEGATIVE locked in a battle to the death, BETTY BRANT is poised to unlock the secret origin of the Chinatown's lord of crime, and to stop her he has sent his newest corrupted enforcer to end her life-- PETER PARKER, the Lacerating SPIDER-MAN!</em></p><p>Hood and Mister Negative are battling in Martin Li/Negative's home. Negative has one of his charged swords, but Hood uses a variety of magical tricks including limited teleportation to keep up the fight. Negative then touches Hood, but seeing as a demon has already corrupted Robinson, the touch has no affect.</p><p>Spiderman meanwhile, corrupted by Negative's touch, pursues reporter Betty Brant, who is on the verge of discovering Negative's identity of Martin Li. Brant reflects on the fact that superhuman battles--especially ones involving Spiderman--have caused the deaths of two of her loved ones (her brother was killed by Doc Ock and her husband was murdered when Hobgoblin I framed him). She then says she is not them though and she wants to live. Spiderman continues to follow her, taunting in Negative's voice and with his costume tainted grey by Negative's powers. Betty Brant is fully aware that it is really the crimelord causing the murder, but Spiderman continues to hunt her down. Snagging her high heeled shoe with his webbing, Peter Parker causes Betty to fall through a glass window. Cleverly, Brant ties a piece of her clothes to a cat, so Spiderman follows that instead. Brant is near Mrs. Li's house, so she runs in there because she thinks Li told Mister Negative to attack and can call the attack off. The older lady insists she didn't think Negative would kill her, and tells Brant a story. Once when she was younger she had reached China before her husband, Martin Li. Wanting to see each other, a deal was made with a gang called the Dragon Lords to have Li smuggled into the country on the boat <em>Golden Mountain</em>. A gangster on the ship paniked as it reached land and forced the captain at gunpoint to go into shallow water. The ship ran aground, and most of the passengers died, including, it appeared, Mr. Li. The Dragon Lords insisted that Li had died on land, so they had completed their part of the deal. Of course, Martin Li had had the money, so Mrs. Li couldn't pay the debts.</p><p>The Dragon Lords took Mrs. Li to a house in Brooklyn and began to torture her to death as punishment, when Mister Negative burst in. At that time, Negative was unknown, and had no gang with him. However, armed with only a charged sword, Negative mercilessly slaughtered the Dragon Lords. Li was chained from the ceiling, and when she saw Negative he seemed completely cold and cruel, and the lady expected to be killed too. Negative asked who she was and Li told her story. Negative seemed confused and momentarilly turned into a man (the comic pannel shows Mister Negative's alter ego Martin). Negative then released Mrs. Li and left. Years later, Mrs Li heard of a Martin Li who survived the <em>Golden Mountain</em> wreck getting a megal from the president. Excited, she got a photo to see if it was her husband, but did not recognize him.</p><p>The corrupted Spiderman then appeared to kill Betty.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hood overpowered Negative. As Parker Robinson grasped his collar, Negative told Hood that he was the Dragon Lord who paniked and caused the <em>Golden Mountain</em> to crash. Gangsters had so mistreated the people they were smuggling that the passengers died. Negative had taken the papers, money, and identity of a passenger, who turned out to be named Martin Li. Negative tried to radio for help from the other Dragon Lords, but got no answer. Returning to New York trying to find answers, he was ambushed by Silvermane, who had taken over Queens from the Dragon Lords (which was why Negative's signal hadn't been answered). Silvermane was amused that Negative was a Dragon Lord (also known as Snakeheads), so he threw him in with several other prisoners at an abandoned place on Ellis Island instead of killing him. Silvermane had the prisoners tested on as a chemist named Simon Marshall tried to develop a drug to replace heroin. Though most people died, Li became a Jekyll/Hyde creature, with a good side and and a very dark side with super powers. When a prisoner named Tyrone (possibly Rapier) was able to break out, Negative and Tyrone's girlfriend escaped. Negative departed from the couple, and adopted the good side as Martin Li and the dark side as Mister Negative. The Li side it appears was unaware of the Mister Negative side.</p><p>At the exact same time, Spiderman was killing Betty. Mrs. Li tried to stop him, but she was knocked down. Brant thoughy of how she used to blame Spiderman but now she new he was just a victim. However, as the wallcrawler was strangling Brant he remembered when his secret identity of Peter Parker loved Betty. Fighting back the corruption, he expelled Mister Negative's touch from his body (which left in the form of smoke). Spiderman apologized (though Brant was unaware he was Peter). Betty told him it was \"No problem,\" but she was coughing badly.</p><p>Hood continued to hold Negative, who told Robinson that he only said his story to him because Robinson would die from the demon (Dormammu) inside him before it could cause harm. Then he said that the yin/yang signs in his garden stood for what he believed was a balance in the world. He says that since he allows Li to continue he is able to prosper more in both identities, unlike Robinson who has let evil take him over almost completely. However, it is quite evident that the Negative persona is stronger and is manipulating the situation over the Li persona. Several members of Hood's gang (including Speed Demon, White Rabbit, Squid, Answer, and Bloodshed) enter, and Hood says that Negative is about to die. Then, though, Norman Osborn calls telling him to stop the murder. As Hood argues, he lets go of Negative, who vanishes. Osborn is then seen telling his Goblin persona that it was all a plan to get the evidence Martin Li II had discovered of experimentation on illegal Asian immigrants by Oscorp.</p><p>Spot, who was working for Hood, then enters Negative's office, having stolen the evidence back. Negative says the evidence shows that whatever Li does it will always be corrupted. It is then revealed that Spot had been an inside man the entire time and had helped Negative escape. In return, Negative was helping to cure the condition of interdimensional (possibly from the Spot Dimension) corruption that Spot and Negative both had (though only Spot wanted to cure it).</p><p>Brant is then seen talking to Martin Li, planning to do a piece on Martin's construction projects to help the community. She says that even though her boss at the DB Dexter Bennett doesn't want her supporting Li (a political adversary of Bennet's allies), she wants a more balanced piece since her last one was a dangerous \"wild goose chase.\" Brant then sees the destruction caused by the Hood/Negative fight and asks Martin how he doesn't hate the crimelords for causing it. Li then says that there is balance and without the evil of Negative he would never have a chance to do so much good. The final pannel shows Martin Li with half his body as a laughing Mister Negative.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The Concluding chapter of the opening story arc opens with Batman holding a prisoner who is tied up with rope on his feet and hands through the streets on the Bat-Quad.  Once he talks Batman leaves him on the steps of GCPD.  Gordon calls Batman and doesn't like is methods, asking \"Who the hell are you?\" to which Batman quickly responds, I'm Batman and telling Gordon to trust him.  Meanwhile Damian wakes up, tied to a chair, watching Professor Pyg operating on a patient.  Pyg rambles on and on, and then starts dancing to music which he describes as Sexy Disco Hot.  As the music plays and Pyg does his weird stripper, dance Damian loosens the rope that binds him, in time to stop Pyg and his goons from putting a face on him.    <br /><br />Damian takes care of business and promises to help this girl get out as long as she stays with him.  However she attacks Pyg and as he starts to flee Damian goes after him, only to be dragged down by the same girl for fear of being left alone.  Damian then gets smacked across the face with a piece of wood.  Pyg looks like he is about to beat Damian, only Batman arrives just in time knocking Pyg out of the way.  Pyg states how he isn't dressed and he didn't do anything wrong.  Both Batman and Robin knock him out together.   <br /> <br />Batman tells Robin that besides going into battle alone and without research he did a good job.  Damian asks him what he's doing here to which Dick replies \"Partners, Remember?\"  Damien asks quietly if he just saved his life back there.  Gordon arrives and Batman tells him about the sickness and the antidote.  As they explain their respective parts Batman states he has found another Domino, like he was meant to find, signally that while this part of the story is finished, it's not over.   <br /> <br />At the end of the issue we see Batman and Robin in the bat mobile discussing Robin and Batman.  There's a sense of continuity because as they are traveling they find Le Bossu, part of the criminal cabal that took down Bruce Wayne and tried to Lobotomize Dick.  Dick indicates to Damien that this time it's personal.  They crash though a window into showing that Batman and Robin are not dead.  Back at Wayne Tower Alfred looks at some pictures as the page pans out to a building across the way, indicating there is someone watching the Tower.   The issue ends with the girl Robin tried to save, attacking police officers while yelling \"He's my Papa ?\"  A mysterious figure asks if she needs a friend as he fatally shoots a police officer she did not see.  He proposes her be his partner asking her to trust the Red Hood, scourge of the underworld.<br /><em> </em></p>",

Pug, on the other side of the magical rift, in the land of the Tsurani, encounters the “Great Ones”, Tsurani magicians who have great powers, and a great interest in the captured human. And back at Crydee, a commotion at the lighthouse and a mysterious approaching ship raise the stakes. Roland may try to find solace in the arms of Princess Carline, but a greater threat looms on the horizon… one that could mean the end of Crydee itself!</i>",

            "description": "<p>Stephanie Brown continues her pursuit of gaining the trust and blessing of Barbara Gordon in her torn Batgirl suit. She is out to fight off the Scarecrow, with back-up at least 5 minutes away. Barbara again tries to dissuade her from going in, but non-the-less tells her where a fear gas inoculation is in Cassandra's utility belt, a statement that does not go unnoticed by Stephanie. Scarecrow, meanwhile releases a new toxin to 2 of his men which causes them to fight each other.</p><p>Meanwhile Stephanie takes out two of Scarecrows goons and soon comes face to face with the Scarecrow himself. Scarecrow releases a new version of the fear gas and Stephanie is forced to flee after being cut by Scarecrow. As Barbara monitors the activity, Stephanie is beginning to hallucinate. Scarecrow kicks her down a flight of stairs, but when she turns around she sees Tim Drake in the Robin uniform. The weaponized Rage-Drug is messing with her mind and soon she gets stabbed in the arm. The hallucinations change to her former identity as Spoiler, as Scarecrow is brutally beating Stephanie, now the Batgirl costume is torn all over the place, including half of her cowl.</p><p>Stephanie begins to black out, remembering things Barbara, a thug, and her mother told her. Barbara screams for her to wake up ,calling her Batgirl for the first time. Stephanie wakes up and begins fighting back, gaining the upper hand, she remembers a question she was asked the other day about about why she stays; her answer because she doesn't know how to do anything else even if that means setting yourself up for failure. When Scarecrow asks her why she stays when she is going to have to face herself and no one is brave enough to do that. She tells him she is he asks her what might that be and she responds \"I'm Batgirl!\" Barbara seems happy to hear this stating that she just might be. As the Police arrive, Stephanie leaves.</p><p>Back at home, Steph makes waffles for her mother and Barbara goes to see Wendy Harris and tells her that she is always available to talk. Barbara takes a position as Assistant Professor at Gotham University, where Stephanie is one of her students.</p><p>Back at the Batcave, Barbara makes an oath with Stephanie, much the same way Bruce did with Dick. She pledges to support Stephanie as she has supported others, letting her know she won't be alone out there. Barbara gives her a new Batgirl suit. Stephanie heads out on the town in her new suit, ready for what the night will bring.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Volume Three of award-winning author Warren Ellis’ ongoing web comic, FREAKANGELS, is here! This installment collects the entire third arc of the post-apocalyptic saga into 144 gorgeous, full-color pages. Twenty-three years ago, twelve strange children were born in England at exactly the same moment. Six years later, the world ended. Today, eleven strange 23-year-olds are living in and defending Whitechapel, maybe the last real settlement in flooded London. They’ve made a new friend, and together they successfully defended their home from raiders–but the post-apocalyptic drowned London that the eleven Freakangels survive in is never a safe place, and never surrounded by friends. In FREAKANGELS: VOLUME THREE, the FreakAngels begin to address how to build their community while a serial killer stalks in their midst. Everything almost comes crashing down around them as one of their own breaks their most valued rule. Ellis’ ongoing story of a flooded London is beautifully illustrated in jaw-dropping detail by Paul Duffield, and every page is as much a work of art as it is a compelling and multi-layered story.</em></p>",

And when  rational men stand face to face with a sea serpent, a Gollywomp, or the  New Jersey Devil bent on taking trophies, they have but two  choices-fight the myth or become history! </i></p><p><i>Value-priced, quality package featuring over three hundred story pages, many never before collected.Featuring work by top comics creators, including Eisner Award  winners Evan Dorkin and Mark Schultz and legendary artist Gene Colan.   </i></p><h3>Collects </h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Predator stories from <a data-ref-id=\"4050-4864\" href=\"/dark-horse-comics/4050-4864/\"> Dark Horse Comics #12-14 </a></li> <li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-27987\" href=\"/predator-bad-blood/4050-27987/\"> Predator: Bad Blood #1-4 </a></li> <li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-31926\" href=\"/predator-kindred/4050-31926/\"> Predator: Kindred #1-4</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-6065\" href=\"/predator-hell-hot-water/4050-6065/\"> Predator: Hell and Hot Water #1-3</a></li> <li><a data-ref-id=\"4050-31934\" href=\"/predator-strange-roux/4050-31934/\"> Predator: Strange Roux </a></li> <li>And the Predator stories from <a data-ref-id=\"4050-3739\" href=\"/dark-horse-presents/4050-3739/\"> Dark Horse Presents #119 &amp; 124</a></li></ul>",

Hikaru’s first school trip also ends in disaster, when he gets separated from the group, and Sachiko begins to worry that Hikaru is losing his hard-fought place in society.</i></p><p>Collects and translates volumes 5 &amp; 6 of Hikari To Tomoni.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Later Elementary Years</h4><ul><li>Episode 13</li><li>Episode 14</li><li>Episode 15</li><li>Episode 16</li><li>Episode 17</li><li>Episode 18</li><li>Episode 19</li><li>Episode 20</li><li>Episode 21</li><li>Episode 22</li><li>Episode 23</li><li>Episode 24</li></ul><h4>What Is Autusm? by Tokio Uchiyama</h4><h4>My \"With the Light...\" by Mariko Abe</h4><h4>My Son Is A Senior In College by Masako Suzuki</h4>",

Or rather, just kind of tilts it slightly to the side.

There's also stories of pirates, time-traveling babies, martial arts masterminds and an all new short story from Elfworld. ISBN: 978-1-60309-055-1<br /></i></p>",

Later, Kosaku strikes a bargain with Sister Angela. If he wins his next big eight-round fight, she'll agree to spend Christmas with him.

            "description": "<p><b><i>A Collection of Volumes 7 - 9!</i></b></p><p><b><i>Arrival in Kyoto</i></b></p><p><i>KYOTO: THE ANCIENT capital of Japan. It was during the chaos of the Bakumatsu that this shining jewel of a city was plunged into violence and bloodshed. The Shinsengumi, an elite corps of deadly warriors, crossed swords with Kenshin more than once in those days, but what has become of their legacy in the new Meiji Era? An old foe, Saitō-Hajime of the Shinsengumi, comes to pay a call at the Kamiya Dojo, but is his visit purely for revenge or a harbinger of much darker schemes to come?</i></p><p><i>Then, on May 14th in the 11th year of Meiji, tragedy strikes. Ōkubo Toshimichi, chief of the Department of Internal Affairs and one of the most powerful men in Japan, is assassinated in broad daylight, but who could be behind such a fiendish plot? It appears that the ghosts of Meiji's bloody past are threatening to wreak havoc on this new age of \"culture and enlightenment\"--personified by Shishio Makoto, the man who took Kenshin's position when he ceased to be Hitokiri Battōsai. Though Kenshin has foresworn the taking of lives, he heeds the call and departs for Kyoto, knowing all too well that Shishio anxiously awaits his arrival!</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Volume 7: In the 11th Year of Meiji, May 14th</h4><ul><li>Act 48: Resurrection of the Wolf</li><li>Act 49: Wolf Without Mercy</li><li>Act 50: Scheme</li><li>Act 51: Confrontation</li><li>Act 52: The Wolf's Fangs</li><li>Act 53: Agreement</li><li>Act 54: The One Who Stops the Two</li><li>Act 55: Enter Ōkubo</li><li>Act 56: Meiji 11, May 14th - Morning</li><li>Act 57: Meiji 11, May 14th - Afternoon</li></ul><h4>Volume 8: On the East Sea Road</h4><ul><li>Act 58: To Kyoto (Part I)</li><li>Act 59: To Kyoto (Part II)</li><li>Act 60: Megumi's Feelings • Kaoru's Feelings</li><li>Act 61: Man Without Emotion</li><li>Act 62: On the East Sea Road</li><li>Act 63: Makimachi Misao</li><li>Act 64: Playing \"It\"</li><li>Act 65: Each to His Own Path</li><li>Act 66: The Abandoned Village</li></ul><h4>Volume 9: Arrival in Kyoto</h4><ul><li>Act 67: Birth of a Small Champion</li><li>Act 68: A Portrait of the Ambitious</li><li>Act 69: The Tactics of Battle</li><li>Act 70: The Sword of Heaven</li><li>Act 71: To Kyoto, Once More</li><li>Act 72: Encounter in the Forest (Part I)</li><li>Act 73: Encounter in the Forest (Part II)</li><li>Act 74: Arrival in Kyoto</li><li>Act 75: Searching for the Sakabatō</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>Our third volume (of six) of the acclaimed hit series collecting the entirety of E.C. Segar's original Popeye (a.k.a. <b>Thimble Theatre</b>) comic strips features work from 1932 to 1934. In addition to the daily and Sunday strips, this volume will present a true collector’s item: Segar’s never-reprinted two-week “World’s Fair” continuity. In 1933, in addition to the normal daily and Sunday continuities, Segar produced a special, two-week sequence of extra-large strips (two to three tiers each) in which Wimpy and Popeye travel to Chicago to take in the World’s Fair. Olive Oyl is left behind on account of “she ain’t wide-minded,” but Olive has other ideas and follows Popeye to make sure he isn’t flirting with any pretty girls. This sequence has never been republished since its original publication 75 years ago.</i></p><p><i>Stories in this volume include \"The Eighth Sea,\" a nautical thriller-diller starring, in his only appearance in the actual Segar Popeye strip, Bluto (plus the shape-shfiting detective Merlock Jones); \"Long Live the King\" and \"Popeye King of Popilania\"; \"Star Reporter,\" in which Popeye juggles his career as a newspaperman and a recent adoptive Dad to the one and only Swee'pea. Plus over a year's worth of great full color Sunday strips, many of them focusing on everyone's favorite glutton Wimpy!</i></p><p><i>This volume also contains the conclusion of Donald Phelps’s incisive and articulate critical essay on Segar’s work “Real People, Real Theatre.”</i></p><p><i>E.C. Segar blended complex narratives, slapstick traditions, brilliant characterization, and an inimitable cartooning style to create the most exciting and profound humor of his era, rivaling the great film comics of his era, such as Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers. Discover this American treasure in this handsomely designed series perfect for all ages.</i></p>",

But the royal family turns out to be a royal pain, especially after Michiru buys his son an entire circus as a souvenir! Naruto and his teammates find themselves training wild animals while the spoiled princes treat them more like servants than shinobi. But when Michiru and Hikaru return home to a villainous uprising, they discover there are some problems money can't solve. Can Hikaru learn what's really important--and find the strength of a true ruler--in time to help his new ninja friends save the kingdom?</em></p>",

Not one lesson goes by without flavour--with him, school is an endless string of break-times. Of course, there’s always Leonie, the terribly gifted girl who doesn't put up with Ducoboo's messing and doesn't believe in sharing knowledge. Of course, there’s also the teacher, whose index finger turns out to be more threatening than ever… No, school life isn’t one long, smooth ride: For some, the school year is perhaps the most dangerous time of all!</em></p>",

Defending wartime America from Nazi airships, ape-men and anything and everything else the Axis can throw at them, the Human Torch and Toro burn up the comic page like it's still 1943. Captain America and Bucky parachute into adventures from mad scientists to buzz-bombing Nazis. Meanwhile, the Destroyer stops at nothing - including a battalion of Hitler impersonators - to stop the Nazi threat. And the Pacific Theatre won't be left waiting, not with the Sub-Mariner around! He takes it straight to the Emperor himself and comes back to clean up the docks while he's at it! But before you speed away, don't miss the Whizzer as he races through maddening mazes and thwarts the plans of kidnapping crooks!</em></p><p><em>Collects All-Winners Comics (1941) #9-14.</em></p>",
