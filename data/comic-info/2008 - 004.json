She explains that if there were ever a security issue, they wouldn’t be prepared for it. Wonder Woman walks back in to reassure the hospital director when they’re in awe with Oliver in a frenzy over Connor. The other members of the Justice League are trying to calm him down when Hal flies in and explains to Oliver what the situation is. But Oliver, too concerned for his son urges Hal to help Connor with all his power, when Hal shouts back at Oliver, saying that he will help all he can. Black Canary calms Oliver down when Black Lightning asks Wonder Woman to secure the area, due to them shouting and using their first names. Wonder Woman takes the back exit out and Batman flies in and tells her that the area is secure. Wonder Woman urges Batman to come inside when Batman refuses, saying that he would be no help here.</p><p>Superman walks back in the room and explains to Oliver that he was scanning the outer orbit, and found nothing.

Plus, the unbelievable origin of underground secret agent Rockman!</p><p>Richard, the Phantom Reporter, overhears Master Mind Excello talking about how he has to leave. He cannot take this world any longer. He needs a lead lined room in a place away from everything. The Army Colonel tells him that the government agreed to pay for this place and doesn't have the money to pay for what he is asking. Master Mind says it doesn't matter. He has the money. He has always prepared for every possibility. He knew someday he might be sent forwards or backwards through time. He made several investments in a rolling trust that would stay active no matter what happened to him.</p><p>A couple of police officers arrive at the mansion. They talk to the Colonel about a thwarted robbery last night. The Colonel tells them that everyone there is free from liability or prosecution for any acts done as a hero. They just want to follow up with procedure. Laughing Mask agrees to cooperate with them. They need to take his guns to the station to have a record since they were fired, the same as they would do for a regular officer. Richard talks to the other officer that tells him about another incident last night. A man that seemed to have gotten rich overnight and didn't appear to be his true age of sixty-five was torn to pieces in his home. The incident happened exactly at midnight and his place was locked from the inside. They have no idea how he was killed. As they're talking, Richard notices Black Widow watching from the top of the stairs.</p><p>Downstairs, Blue Blade tries talking to Rockman. He's been offered a chance to be on television. He figures that the two of them could make a great act together. Blue Blade says he needs to know where he's from before he can introduce him to the agency. Rockman tells Blue Blade about his kingdom and how he was separated. Blue Blade figures it's too much of a tale for people to believe.</p><p>The others decide to have a party for Master Mind as a send off. Dynamic Man comes in and chastises them for their lack of heroics. Richard gets in his face saying that it's harder for some of them to get over the fact that all their friends and loved ones are gone. They're not as perfect as he is. He continues to make references to this and compares him to what they were fighting in the first place, the Master Race the Germans craved. Saluting him in a Nazi fashion, Dynamic Man is outraged and prepares to pound him. Captain Wonder holds his arm back and stops him. Dynamic Man says he just came so they wouldn't forget the twelfth member of their group and brings out the inert Electro. Another \"relic nobody knows what to do with anymore.\"</p><p>Richard tries talking to Black Widow. He suggests they leave to get to know each other. She says he doesn't know anything about her and should keep it that way. Blue Blade comments that it seems that Electro has moved. Then he gets the idea that perhaps he could team up with the robot.</p><p>In another room, Master Mind sits with Mr. E. He asks him if he thinks the party is going well. Mr. E. tells him he's Jewish. Pondering for a moment, Master Mind tells him that he is too.</p><p>The party ends. Master Mind will move into a place upstate that most of them are welcome to visit (except Dynamic Man). Black Widow goes out to a club. Rockman returns to pound on the basement floor. Mr. E. cries himself to sleep. Richard begins to write his column for the Daily Bugle.</p>",

Will the curious power of the \"Book of the Dead\" (which started this whole violent mess) actually hold the key to his survival? In the final chapter of this adaptation and EXPANSION of the classic Sam Raimi film, more disgusting, demonic bile will fly before Ash’s night is over! Take a trip down memory lane, to celebrate the first time The Evil Dead scared the pants off you--or visit this evil cabin for the first time and enjoy. This is the original gore-fest that started it all--and the comic book series is peppered with moments of pure terror that weren’t in the original film!</p>",

In the future Sam Guthrie is one of the only remaining mutants and he’ll do anything in his power to save Cable and the baby. It’s Cannonball versus Bishop in a fight to the death!</i></p><p>Cable landed in the mutantless future of 2043 and once there was ambushed by the former X-Man Lucas Bishop, who tracked him through time. Bishop tried to kill the messiah child, in hopes of preventing his horrific future from becoming reality, but fell captive to a band of highwaymen. Injured, and with a malfunctioning time mechanism, Cable sought shelter with a waitress named Sophie. He learned that the highwaymen are agents of the Turnpike Authority, a brutal regime who use fear and violence to control the population. Sophie hopes Cable will help change that, but before either of them can decide on a course of action the house is rocked by a great explosion. The front door flies off its hinges and in walks Cable’s old protйgй – Cannonball.</p><p>What happened:</p><ul><li><p>As Cable and Cannonball reunite in Sophie's apartment, Bishop goes back to the fight scene and finds no dead bodies – meaning he's back on the hunt for Cable and the child. He goes to the near diner and attacks the manager, wanting answers for the whereabouts of his targets.</p></li><li><p>Sam tells Nathan that all mutants are gone but him. They were exterminated in less than three decades; Cable's mission has failed. Meanwhile, Bishop gets his answers and heads to Sophie's place.</p></li><li><p>Sam says that he used Cerebra to locate Cable. After the last telepath died the remaining mutants managed to work the device. Eventually Sam was left alone and for years watched mutants gone. Then he waited more for Cable's return, until now.</p></li><li><p>Soon after, a near explosion confirms that Bishop is coming. Cannonball decides to stay and stop Bishop while Cable, Sophie and baby escape. Bishop is surprised to see Sam and don't want to fight him. Sam doesn't share the same sentiments, still angry about Bishop's betrayal in the X-Men years ago. He attacks Bishop and looks like he has the upper hand.</p></li><li><p>Cable asks Sophie to make a stop. He desperately tries to work his time mechanism and prevent the imminent tragedy. Cannonball gives his best shot and smashes into Bishop, creating a crater. Bishop's cybernetic arm releases a tentacle and goes through Sam's chest. As he's dying, the tentacle holding his bleeding heart, Sam asks Bishop why he's doing this. \"To save you\", his killer replies and stand over the dead body of the former X-Man. Cable is saddened by his failure to go back in time and eventually decides: No more running.</p></li></ul><p>Not everyone is fond of bathing in boiled oil, so Bishop's attempts to be nice are actually taken the wrong way. At least it gets him the answers he needs.</p><p>Someone needs to be changed, and it ain't the baby.</p><p>In 2043 Sam Guthrie works in the New Jersey Public Works Dept.</p><p>Bishop invented this treatment: Give the heart 2 minutes outside once a day to prevent heart attacks. It was yet to be contradicted.</p>",

Plus, a co-feature in issue #1 explores the mysterious connection between several villains who are watching the Trinity -as well as the near future for these characters and their surrounding world! Co-features in issues #2-4 fill in back-story on some of the other important players in this major storyline. These stories are written by Busiek &amp; Fabian Nicieza with art by Scott McDaniel &amp; Andy Owens (NIGHTWING, GREEN ARROW), Tom Derenick &amp; Wayne Faucher and Mike Norton &amp; Jerry Ordway (ALL-NEW ATOM, INFINITE CRISIS).</em></p><p>\"Caped Simioid Thinks So, Hm?\" - The Justice League continue to face off against Konvikt, drawing him away from populated areas and into the country. Meanwhile, Batman takes this opportunity to follow his trail back to the craft he arrived in.</p><p>\"World-Something...\" - Marguerita is still troubled by her dreams and her tarot-readings. She even is plagued in her dreams, including one dream featuring a battle between Despero and Kanjar Ro..</p><p><b>Spoilers:</b></p><p>Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and some of the JLA continue to try to take down Konvikt and Graak. Superman recovers from Konvikt's punch last week and carries them high in the sky as he tells the others to save the city people. Graak reveals that he has some blasting power and knocks Superman back. He asks Konvikt to save them from their fall.</p><p>Morgaine and Enigma watch the events from her lair. She notes that Superman is the Savior in the Trinity while Wonder Woman gives others the Inspiration to do things. She wonders if Batman's role is to \"scare the Hell out of people.\" Enigma laughs and says there is a lot more to Batman than she's seen. She then sees that Batman is running off while the heroes are still trying to stop Konvikt.</p><p>Out in the country Wonder Woman sees that Konvikt's body has transformed slightly and he appears to have gotten stronger. From behind her, what appears to be a blue-furred arm reaches out and presses a red globe against her shoulder blade. It burns and leaves a mark. Before she can fully react, Konvikt is on top of her. Superman arrives to join in the battle as they try to give Batman more time.</p><p>Batman has back-tracked Konvikt to his ship. He contacts Superman and says it appears to be an escape pod. He'll let him know if there's anything else there. In the shadows, Graak is waiting to blast Batman from behind.</p><p>In the <em>back-up story</em>...Tarot cannot resist the temptation of reading her own cards to see what the recent events meant. The first reveals she may have a connection to a higher power. The second says she has to use her powers for the world. The third card is Death. The death card usually means the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. She feels the power of the cards drawing her in. She doesn't understand how it's happening and after seeing a vision of the universe, she decides she needs sleep.</p><p>Tarot dreams of Despero attacking a world. He soon comes face to face with Kanjar Ro. They fight and Kanjar Ro soon takes off. He wonders why Despero is interested in an interspatial gateway. In her sleep, Tarot mumbles that Despero doesn't know why, he simply dreamed it and is drawn to it. Before she can see what lies on the other side of the gateway, she is woken up by her phone. It is Jose calling to say that he has not been able to find any information on the \"Three Who Shall Rise\" gang. He is worried though because the M.V.G. gang members that were killed (when chasing Tarot) had dealings with an older, more powerful gang. Picking up his Gangbuster helmut, he tells her that he's hoping things don't get worse for her with the gangs.</p>",

As this never-before-seen chapter of Spidey’s life unfolds, witness the trials and tribulations of young Peter confronting fame, money and everything he ever dreamed of! With a healthy dose of that ol’ Parker luck, of course…</em></p><p>The city is under attack from a creature that looks like it stepped out of a movie staring monsters in rubber suits. Even though the Fantastic Four have shown up to fight this monstrosity, the situation is still grave. With his spider-sense to warn him, Peter moves through the crowd of panicking people to get uncle Ben and Liz to safety. Among all the chaos, Peter comes across a homeless man trapped under rubble. The Thing steps in and gives Peter a hand and tells him that he's got more spine than all the thugs on Yancy Street combined. Unfortunately, the homeless man still dies, despite being saved, which weighs heavily on Peter's conscience. Thing tries to console Peter but he runs away.</p><p>During the long drive home, uncle Ben tries to comfort Peter, telling him that it was the Fantastic Four's job to handle the situation because they have powers. Uncle Ben says the famous line \"With great power there must also come great responsibility.\" He says he's proud of his nephew for trying to help even though he has no powers, making Peter feel even worse.</p><p>Still feeling down, Peter goes to a club with Tiffany as Spider-Man, has a few drinks and ends up puking his guts out in the toilet. Peter tells Tiffany that he was there when that monster attacked, how he tried to save a man but he still died. She says that it wasn't his responsibility. Peter passes out and she takes a peek under his mask.</p><p>Peter wakes up and see J. Jonah Jameson ranting about how Spider-Man acts irresponsibly while the city is in danger. It is then decided by Monty's higher ups that Spider-Man has to become a hero.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>A woman in trouble, friends on the run from cops and mobsters, and a secret no one is prepared to face! All this and more await readers in the beginning of a hard-hitting new noir tale “Bad Night” Part 1 of 4, as CRIMINAL’s new expanded format keeps the hits coming! Five years ago, Jake was a happy family man, long-retired from the life of crime he grew up in, and then the police made him the prime suspect in a horrible crime and ripped his life apart. Now, years later, Jake is less than a shadow of his former self, a hopeless insomniac who walks the city streets at night. But one night, he walks into the wrong place at the right time, and his whole life changes again… For the better or the worse, is the question. And on top of this longer-than-usual length main story, CRIMINAL now features an expanded back-pages section, as well – with articles by Brubaker and other top crime writers, from novelists to screenwriters to comic writers. These noir articles have become a popular piece of the CRIMINAL package, and are something that can only be found in the comics, not in any collections. So don’t miss out on the start of a new story arc in the most acclaimed crime comic on the stands!</i></p>",

Millions now toil as slaves of Darkseid, while the Justifier shock troops of Apokolips lay waste to the planet Earth and hunt down its protectors.</p><p>The remaining free humans and superheroes are stationed around the world, besieged within the walls of ten very familiar 'Watchtowers', as they fight a desperate, losing battle against the triumphant forces of evil.</p><p>While Green Arrow and Black Canary attempt to deliver the secret of humanity's last hope across America's blasted wastelands, the Outsiders brave the horrors of the Bludhaven bunker in search of Batman. The ultimate battle is coming…but which heroes will become villain – and vice versa? And what part do the Secret Society have to play in the dawning of this new Age of Evil?</p><p>Darkness is falling and death rules the day. Is this truly the end of the Age of Super Heroes?</p><p>The Ray narrates how the Anti-Life Equation has infected most people on Earth and how the Darkseid's forces have taken over very easily. The Ray arrives at the Hall of Justice to give information to survivors of Anti-Life the group includes Green Arrow, The Tattooed Man (with some sort of symbol Black Lightning told him about), Black Canary, Oracle, Jai and Iris West, Wally West's wife Linda and Jay Garrick's wife Joan.</p><p>The first wave of the Bludhaven have been defeated. Dan Turpin is resisting the control of Darkseid in Command-D station. His followers Simyan Mokkari and Godfrey cannot properly reside in human bodies and argue who Darkseid will save. It is revealed that Kalibak is in the body of a humanoid tiger that has been created for him.</p><p>In the Watchtower the survivors show their doubt of fighting Darkseid but Ray tells them of some hope they have because a informant in Libra's Secret Society has given them information of a internet that only villains use called the Unternet which is now being used by Checkmate and all other forms of the Resistance to Darkseid to coordinate their attacks.</p><p>Mister Terrific and Alan Scott use the Unternet to lead the Resistance who have made \"Watchtowers\" all over the globe. Amanda Waller has now come in contact with Renee Montoya who is told she plays a big part of a plan to save Earth. Black Adam is convinced by Captain Marvel to join The Resistance. Alan Scott tells the other heroes that as many of them must converge at Bludhave at dawn to fight Darkseid.</p><p>At the Hall of Justice The Tattooed Man rearranges his tattoos and shows the symbol Black Lighting told him of and resembles Metron. Black Lighting himself breaks the defense of the Hall.</p><p>Wally West and Barry Allen briefly enjoy their reunion as Barry tells Wally he is not sure how he was brought back to life. The two then battle the new Female Furies in the form of a Anti-Life infected Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Batwoman and Giganta. Wally and Barry then escape to find their families.</p><p>In the Hall of Justice Green Arrow rushes the others to the Watchtower teleporters but chooses to stay behind and remove the teleporters location codes so they cannot be tracked to outer space. Black Canary attempts to give him a kiss goodbye but is interrupted by a Anti-Life infected Black Lightning with other Justifiers. Green Arrow tries to fight back but is infected with Anti-Life via Justifier helmet. Aboard the outer space Watchtower briefly reflects on Green Arrow's sacrifice and then tells the other to search for weapons.</p><p>As The Resistance continue to battle their own who are infected with Anti-Life, Hawkgirl notices that the sky is raining Blood.

            "description": "<p>(Los Angeles, sun set)</p><p>As Victor runs through the house, Nico follows him, wondering what she did wrong with her spell. Victor feels that it's the only explanation - Nico wasn't affected because it was her spell, and he was affected because he was alreadyscattered, on account of Lillie. The two rush to Karolina Dean's room to where they inform her of their discover, but Karolina reluctantly follows them back downstairs.</p><p>When Nico points out she isn't sure how to get rid of the side-effect, Victor thinks that they are only in a reflection of the main spell; if they break the illusion, they may break the spell. While Karolina guards the suspicious-looking vaDanti, Victor runs off to grab Molly and Klara while Nico calls Chase and Xavin.</p><p>Nico calls Chase's workplace, where he is at KZIT shining Val's boots. Nico informs him to return home, seeing as he's under her spell. Chase stubbornly refuses to return home, and hangs up. A furious Nico slams her fist against a table, causing her fist to bleed. Instantly, her new Staff of One emerges. Nico suggests she may as well use it. Nico points the Staff out at the beach, to where Xavin is still at the beach party. Calling <b>\"Xavin! Here! Now!\"</b>, Xavin is magically pulled towards Nico, frightening the neighbours. As she flails through the air, she turns into her Thing-like form, crashing into the house's balcony. Xavin, grumbling, enters the house behind Nico and Karolina.</p><p>(Malibu, sun set)</p><p>Victor hurries along the beaches of Malibu to find Molly and Klara - as daylight is fading, he calls out for them. He notices the fort they've made, and laughs. Even as he laughs, the grass and plants around him rise up around his body, keeping him hostage. Knowing who the culprit is, he tells Klara to cut it out, and the two young girls reveal their hiding places in the undergrowth. They have plants on their heads to aid their disguise.</p><p>Molly is proud of her trap - she snaps her fingers, and Klara automatically calls for the plants to lie down. Molly informs Victor this is just a drill, but he gets the idea. Victor mocks them, but Molly tells him not to underestimate \"Princess Powerful and her trusty sidekick, Tower of Flower.\" Old Lace is in the bushes, as a back up to Molly and Klara's plan. Victor drags the girls and Old Lace back to the house, where Klara tells Molly she wouldn't want to be called \"Tower of Flower\", but \"Rose Red\". As they get back to the house, Molly suggests \"Rose Wild\", \"Rose Wildweed\", \"Roses Gone Wild\"... but the topic is dropped the second they see what is in their living room.</p><p>The gluttonous thing that spilled out of vaDanti's wrist glove from the previous issue takes on the form of a large, gluttonous bubble - encased in the middle of the bubble, however, are Nico, Xavin and Karolina. It is at this point where Klara notes that vaDanti had escaped.</p><p>Victor's electricity proves to be useless on the bubble. Molly, however decides to punch the bubble - this idea goes wrong, as Molly is sucked into the bubble with the others; Klara, who had attempted to stop Molly lands in the bubble as well. Victor remains to be the only Runaway (besides Chase at work) who isn't in the bubble. As Xavin, Karolina, Nico, Molly and Klara stare at Victor from the bubble, Victor takes a large spear and attempts to stab the bubble, which drags him into it as well. The others angrily lose their temper with Victor.</p><p>Molly attempts to punch her way out, but Nico and Karolina hold her back - they can't just start bashing around, as someone will get hurt. Xavin explains that the bubble is too flexible for force, but Molly doesn't believe her and punches it again. This time, the bubble expands and contracts quickly, but Molly's punch does the trick. The bubble explodes in a swirl of gloopy Majesdanian colours, covering them all with slimy gloop.</p><p>As they recover, Victor mentions the only thing he does like about Majesdane so far is Karolina. Karolina, Xavin, Molly and Klara attempt to leave for the shower, but Nico holds them back and reveals to them what her spell had did - they were scattered to a point where they wouldn't work together long enough to escape a bubble. What made them a team flew right out the window.</p><p>Nico continues by asking if they can feel it, inside - a total disconnect from the others, the desire to do their own thing no matter what anyone says. An anguished Nico reminds them the Majesdanians are coming back to take Karolina away from them, and there is no way they can stop them if they can't even beat a bubble. She asks to look around and ask if they look like a team of super heroes. Xavin admits that it's not their finest moment. \"We look like losers,\" adds a depressed Molly. Karolina agrees as well; she doesn't feels disconnected from everyone... even Xavin.</p><p>The Runaways ask if Nico can reverse the spell, but Nico fears that by using a spell to undo the scatter effect, she may get more side-effects. Xavin suggests she practice on Chase (who is at work), but Victor brings up his suggestion. Victor explains that he's been thinking about it, and doesn't feel that they're under the full power of the spell - just a weaker reflection of it, since they were in the room when Nico cast it. He thinks that they can break the spell's effect if they just concentrate on something that needs total cooperation with each other.</p><p>Nico agrees that the plan makes sense, but before they can act, Karolina spots something outside... the Runaways move out on to the balcony as something drops from the clouds. Victor hopes that it's just a weather balloon, but Xavin points out that weather balloons don't leave vapor trails... the Majesdanian's have returned, but the Runaways aren't even ready at all.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>In this issue, Xavin wears a Bryant 24 vest in this issue. Kobe Bryant is (at the time of writing) a basketball player for the L.A. Lakers.</p><p>Victor also references Lillie, the girl he fell in love with in 1907. Victor was already \"scattered\" because Lillie had changed her mind about coming to the present, breaking Victor's heart. Lillie spent the rest of her life in regret. This took place in issue #30 (June 2008).</p>",

Thomas scripted the continuing adventures of Conan, drawing from Robert E. Howard's original tales-along with other Conan adventures-and working with such esteemed artists as John Buscema, Sal Buscema, Ernie Colon, Klaus Janson, and the amazing Gil Kane! The Savage Sword of Conan brought the world thrilling adaptations of \"Sons of the White Wolf,\" \"The Legions of the Dead,\" and \"The Treasure of Tranicos.\" The real treasure in this massive tome, however, is the sprawling, ambitious adaptation of the Conan the Buccaneer novel by the powerhouse team of Roy Thomas, John Buscema, and Tony DeZuniga! This volume is sure to deliver brutal barbarian violence as well as horrific, chilling surprises...</i></p><p><i>This volume collects Savage Sword of Conan the Barbarian issues 37 to 48.</i></p>",

Unfortunately, this involves killing a lot of people, transforming the happy-go-lucky guerrilla journalist into a modern monster. Crazed Toguchi also makes some sensitive information public, enraging Zenitsu, another unbalanced villain with a knack for murder and a resistance to pain.

Instead of Shakkû, though, Kenshin finds his son Seikû, who has given up making instruments of death. But when word gets around that before he passed away Shakkû forged a final blade, one of Shishio's warriors also decides to pay a visit, and he doesn't plan on leaving empty-handed. With the safety of Seikû's family at risk, Kenshin springs into action, even if it means fighting without a weapon at his side!</i></p><p><i>Kenshin realizes that if he is to defeat Shishio the time has come to complete his training in Hiten Mitsurugi-ryû. But first he will have to convince his incredibly stubborn master, Hiko Seijûrô, that he is indeed worthy of Hiten Mitsurugi's greatest secrets and techniques. Then, with all of his Juppongatana \"Ten Swords\" fighters now in Kyoto, Shishio kicks into high gear with his scheme to radically alter the face of Meiji Era Japan. Can Kenshin, Saitô and Misao marshal their resources in time to prevent Shishio from burning Kyoto to the ground?!</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Volume 10: Mitsurugi, Master and Student</h4><ul><li>Act 76: The Ten Swords in Action</li><li>Act 77: Prelude to Battle</li><li>Act 78: Chō of the Ten Swords</li><li>Act 79: The Thinnest Blade</li><li>Act 80: Drawing of the Forbidden</li><li>Act 81: Shakkū's Wish</li><li>Act 82: Where the Strings Meet</li><li>Act 83: Hiko Seijūrō</li><li>Act 84: The Mitsurugi Apprenticeship</li></ul><h4>Volume 11: Overture to Destruction</h4><ul><li>Act 85: Half the Feeling</li><li>Act 86: Aoshi &amp; Okina</li><li>Act 87: Meetings of the Warlords</li><li>Act 88: Overture to Destruction</li><li>Act 89: Aoshi vs. Okina</li><li>Act 90: Finale of Fresh Blood</li><li>Act 91: Misao's Decision</li><li>Act 92: A Bird and a Broom</li><li>Act 93: The Man Named Usui</li></ul><h4>Volume 12: The Great Kyoto Fire</h4><ul><li>Act 94: The Initiation Begins</li><li>Act 95: Even If It Costs My Life</li><li>Act 96: Between Life and Death</li><li>Act 97: The Ten Swords Summoned</li><li>Act 98: The Other Objective</li><li>Act 99: As If in Flight</li><li>Act 100: The Great Kyoto Fire (Part I)</li><li>Act 101: The Great Kyoto Fire (Part II)</li><li>Act 102: The Great Kyoto Fire (Part III)</li></ul>",
