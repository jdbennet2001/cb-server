She hasn't contacted Boomer (Captain Boomerang) with whom she had a close friendship. Boomer is drinking away his sorrows at a bar telling his story to someone that bears a strong resemblance to Cassandra Cain, Batgirl.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kara, Supergirl, has been spending more and more time with <a href=\"/powerboy/42001/\" data-ref-id=\"42001\"> Powerboy</a>. They have become closer and closer and more intimate, evidenced by a kiss after the couple put down an attempt on Kara by the DNAngels. </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Elsewhere, in a Tibetan lair of the <a href=\"/league-of-assassins/9591/\" data-ref-id=\"9591\"> League of Assassins</a>, Cassandra Cain is discussing her \"tests\" against Supergirl with her client. Cain plans on fulfilling the contract that night.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">At Supergirl's apartment, she tells Powerboy that in order to find who's trying to kill her, she needs to go someplace on her own. Powerboy is not happy with being left behind and grabs Kara's wrist to detain her. She calms him down and leaves him with Streaky, teasing that it is the cat's inability to use her litter box that has earned her the name. Powerboy frowns as a call from Boomer comes in.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Supergirl goes to the Batcave and uses their computer while Batman is elsewhere. Robin tells her she can't just come in and use it whenever she wants, but Kara sways him by revealing that <a href=\"/wonder-girl/4005-10885/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10885\">Wonder Girl </a>revealed to her that she and the Boy Wonder shared a kiss. Supergirl asks for information on Cassandra and the League of Assassins. Robin says she's the only person to ever have hurt Bruce, which makes her the most dangerous person on the planet.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Kara sets off to confront the League, but the former Batgirl was ready for her. Using diamond dust, red wavelength uvb lights, and dressed in her Batgirl costume, Cassandra attacks Supergirl. The narrative shifts back and forth from the fight to flashbacks of her father seemingly experimenting on her, telling her that she's <i>special.</i></p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the fight, she sees Boomer beaten and chained overhead. Captain Boomerang is at first relieved to see that Supergirl has responded to his attempts to contact her to rescue him, but is shocked to discover Kara is ignorant of his calls. Kara is trying to explain when Cassandra takes advantage and slashes Kara's stomach with a energy katana, drawing blood. Grabbing her from behind, Cassandra and Supergirl are both surprised when some crystal-like blades protrude from Supergirl's back and stomach wound, impaling Batgirl's shoulder and side. Kara places a call to Powerboy to help her with the injured Boomer, interrupting Powerboy from adding another photo of her to his secret shrine to her. </p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>The League loses a member as writer Dwayne McDuffie turns up the heat in the \"Injustice League\" story arc! A party has turned very deadly for the World's Greatest Heroes when they find themselves prisoners of the Injustice League!</p><p>Superman and Black Lightning confront Lex Luthor in his powered up suit and Superman and Lex are having small talk. Lex riles up Superman by insulting him because Superman is never angry. Black Lightning then orders Lex to tell them where the rest of the Justice League is. Lex insults Black Lightning and Black Lightning sends a thunderbolt towards Lex, but it turns out to be a hologram.</p><p>Lex appears once again and Superman asks what Lex wants from him. Lex replies that it’s obvious. He wants Superman’s rage and Lex reveals his plan; that he wants Superman so angry that his powers will mean nothing in the future. Lex reveals how he plans to do that, up comes a large video feed of the Justice League being tortured. Superman is being held back by Black Lightning and video feeds of Shaggy Man being tortured gets Superman to order Lex to tell him where they are located. However, Lex stops the hologram and tells Superman to find him.</p><p>The both of them were tracking his resonance frequency and they spot the hologram projector when it explodes in Superman’s face and a small amount of kryptonite hits his face.</p><p>In the Hall of Doom, Lex questions Joker about the kryptonite paint and Joker replies that Lex <i>did</i> want to make Superman angry and compares it to a cavity search from loved ones. Lex stops him before too much information is revealed when Cheetah tells Lex about Grodd almost killing Geo-Force. Lex stops Grodd and he replies that it’s fun to hit him. However, Lex tells him that no one is to kill anyone until Superman is captured. Grood complies and reveals his plan of eating him after he tenderised Geo-Force’s body. Joker adds that that would something he would like to see. Lex then appreciates Grodd’s patience and adds that these videos of them being humiliated will be vital in achieving their long term goals.</p><p>Back with Superman and Black Lightning, he is washing off the kryptonite paint off Superman’s face with water and he asks what plan they have.  Superman replies that he is going to take them apart and Black Lightning adds he will call in the reserves. However, Superman says that there is no time. Black Lightning buts in, telling Superman to take it easy because Lex is just making him angry on purpose. He tells Superman that Lex knows how to push his buttons and Superman replies that Black Lightning is completely objective about Lex. Black Lightning disagrees, saying that he has lost a few due to him. The both of them then agree to take on Lex by themselves. They fly towards the Hall of Doom and while Black Lightning lands his plane, Superman shoots through and goes for Parasite first, throwing up towards the sky.</p><p>Lex orders everyone to protect the prisoners and Black Lightning comes in from behind, zapping some foes. Lex claims he is just a decoy and Black Lightning strikes Lex and has him in an electric bubble. Cheetah orders Killer Frost to attack him but she refuses and Chesire steps him. Dr. Light then takes care of Superman, claiming that he’s no faster than light. All of them then pile on Superman and he is knocked unconscious. </p><p>Lex then says, “I’d hate for you to miss what comes next…” while holding a shard of kryptonite to his face.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p> <p>An electrifying new era begins for the world's greatest superheroine! Gail Simone (BIRDS OF PREY, SECRET SIX) joins the phenomenal art team of Terry and Rachel Dodson for what promises to be one of the most exciting Wonder Woman stories ever told! </p> <p>What exactly is The Circle, and what deadly secret do they hold about Diana's birth? What familiar face from Wonder Woman's past returns with a mission to spy on Special Agent Diana Prince? Why is the Department of Metahuman Affairs on a collision course with the wounded remnants of the Society of Super-Villains? You won't want to miss any of this story that spans the globe and shakes Diana to her core!</p> <p>On Themyscira, a story of Diana’s birth is told. It was not all smiles and joy; it was an act of destruction but creation at the same time. There was darkness and thunder and there was also blood. But that woman who made demands of the Gods and lived now walks unworthy steps, as she has sent her sisters away… or nearly so. At the north part of the island, Hippolyta asks her sister if she repents. The commentary continues, saying that she has been a great leader. On the west side, she asks the same question, only to be answered with the same answer. The commentary says she has destroyed what the Amazons stand for, but between all this shame, there is tradition. On the east side, the same question is asked, answered the same answer. And beyond this tradition, there is duty. On the south side, Hippolyta asks the same question. As Hippolyta walks away, Alkyone calls for her. She explains that every year she does this and that she insults us by asking them. Hippolyta replies, saying that it is the law; however, it is a law a she created. Alkyone sticks her hand out and gives her a tiara, carved out of wood and engraved on it says, “Our queen.” She explains that she had to gnaw this with her teeth. Hippolyta says that Alkyone had killed and betrayed. She stops her and says that Hippolyta is the one that betrayed them all when she birthed the dragon. Alkyone begs of her to kill her daughter and make them a tribe again. Hippolyta says she can’t, as she is her daughter. The prisoner replies that she deserves to know the truth. Hippolyta says she can’t, though, because it would just break her heart. She breaks the carved tiara and runs off.</p> <p>In Africa, Wonder Woman is asking some enhanced gorillas to explain to her who they are exactly. The gorilla continues to explain that they are the most extraordinary fighters on Earth, and to take back the land that belonged to them. The enhanced gorilla continues to explain that they were designed to kill Superman, if necessary. Wonder Woman comments on what she sees as a compliment: “You’re fighting me to see if you can defeat Superman? I’m honoured.” She comments on the gorillas. Even with the hyper-intelligent, youth of the gorillas, even they can be easily misled to hurt or to terrorise. She also wonders why she has a sudden urge for tropical fruit as well. They are too strong to wrestle and they have a natural gorilla’s agility and rage and skilled with their energy swords. However, their anger makes it Wonder Woman’s win. She finds their leader, and takes him head on. She holds the energy sword between her hands and jumps over him, wrapping her lasso around his neck and throwing him over the waterfall. Wonder Woman jumps down to see if he’s still breathing. Wonder Woman yells, “Yield!” and says that she wishes only to speak. The other gorillas hold her down and Wonder Woman tells them to stop, as she wishes only to talk with them.</p> <p>The leader of the clan introduces himself as Tolifhar. Wonder Woman asks if Grodd had told them that they wanted the humans dead. Tolifhar replies that she shouldn’t mock him, as he has seen the poachers. Wonder Woman replies that like him, Grodd can create lies as well, and as an Amazon, she will put an end to these atrocities. She explains that you and your people were not meant to lead to this life. Tolifhar is not so convinced though, as the people will punish them for what they have done. Wonder Woman replies that she will speak to Solovar’s council on his behalf, after the “cooling period” as long as they don’t devour any more humans. Tolifhar is a taken a back by this but he swears he won’t, with a “Your Majesty” on the end. Wonder Woman understands these gorillas as she knows that they are a race of hierarchy… and that’s why she never prefers Batman’s methods. Tolifhar comments on her, saying that Grodd told us that she would be vengeful. Wonder Woman disagrees, as vengeance is not who she is. She then says that the Gods have banned her from Themyscira, but she still has a place for her to stay.</p> <p>At Diana’s apartment, Tolifhar apologises for the flinging accident. Diana says it’s fine, as they are guests. She then hears her bell, and says that would be her ride. She opens the door ever so slightly and Tom Tressor is there. Tom then says that he’s never seen her apartment and rushes in and says “Oh my God,” but not because of the gorillas, but because it’s so empty. Diana comments, “Clever houseguests!” The gorillas come out after the both of them have left the house and comment on Diana and Tom’s relationship. One says, “They will mate soon if they haven’t already.” One agrees, “Their movement and scent confirm it, Rhanda.” However, one gorilla is too occupied with a drink, “All I can add is that this ice beverage is delicious.” Tom and Diana talk about ways people can be perceived and Tom says that she should be entitled today, as it’s her birthday. Diana commentary says that she had always wanted to learn their rituals, more than just an observer. She says that in her society, such kindness would be greeted with hugs and maybe even tears and says that such hugging is frowned upon. On the other hand, there is cake and that excuses much. Tom tells Diana to not be so surprised, as he checked her personal profile. Diana, surprised but not able to say anything mumbles something. Sarge Steel comes in and says, “Agent Prince. Front and centre, if you would.” He asks her where she got this information that she faxed her. Diana continues to explain what’s on the fax and Sarge Steel says that he knows about it, but where did she get it? Steel agrees with her assessment of this new threat and orders her and Tom to strike a cooperative strike with Canada. Diana pulls Tom out of the party and says, “We’ve got to save the world.”</p> <p>Back at the office, Sarge Steel meets with Etta Candy, now known as Lt. Colonel. She goes on to explain how Diana has connections to the Amazons, the same Amazons that threatened to topple the government. Etta goes on to assess Sarge Steel, calling him a self medicating doctor and a bad liar. If he wanted someone to do dirty, she can do dirty. She comments on the woman, and says that if she has betrayed this country in any manner, she’ll regret the day she was born.</p> <p>With Diana and Tom, they’re flying in an invisible stealth chopper, donated by an anonymous Gotham billionaire. Just above the building, they lower themselves onto the rooftop. Tom, with his macho-ego, says for Diana to stay behind him and will try to protect her if there are any hostiles inside. Diana replies, “You are most kind.” In front of the door of where they’re supposed to be, Tom destroys a small lock with some C4, something she could have done with her small toe. She also adds that her respect for actors has increased dramatically. They enter the kitchen to find that no one’s been here for weeks. Captain Nazi steps him with a “Not true.” Diana comments on Tom’s inability to stand up against this guy and Diana hits him with her own weapon but it fails as it breaks in half. Captain Nazi hits the both of them back into a wall, and then holds Diana up against a wall. Captain Nazi reveals his plan, that he wanted a country to remake, where their beliefs are no longer outlawed; a country too foolish to have even the mildest defences. On Themyscira, Captain Nazi’s army is on Themyscira. The captain declares, “I declare Themyscira as property of the Society. Search this island – kill all you find. <em>Kill all you find!</em>”</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>As Spider-Girl learns the fate of a family member, the Hobgoblin unearths the secret origin of the Black Tarantula. Learn the fate of Araña. And what's little Benjy doing crawling...on the ceiling?</i></p><p>The Hobgoblin smashes his way into the headquarters of the cult of Madame Web. The room is filled with blindfolded women dressed in red robes. He tells them he's not there to hurt them, he just wants to talk to Madame Web. His violence is stopped when one lady tells him she is no longer with them. She is the one that sits in the Chair of Clairvoyance. She knows he is there seeking information on Black Tarantula. She tells him that he is in luck because her cult hates Black Tarantula too.</p><p>In the Parker home, May gets ready to leave for school. Before she does, she wants to give her brother Benjy his juice. Looking in the living room, she discovers that he is not in his playpen. Freaking out, she is suddenly hit on the head by a pacifier from directly above her. Little Ben is crawling on the ceiling. May manages to get him down just before Mary Jane comes down the stairs. Mary Jane mentions that she, Ben, and Peter are taking the next couple days to enjoy some peace without the mention of any \"spider-stuff.\"</p><p>Walking to school with Davida, May is a little distant. They are surprised to see Gene Thompson arm-in-arm with Simone DeSantos. Davida is ready to give him a piece of her mind but May stops her. She says the break up wasn't all his fault. (The real reason was because her activities as Spider-Girl took time away from Gene). Davida then asks May if she's given any thoughts to Wes. May says she's not sure if she's ready to jump into another relationship. Davida warns her that if she doesn't make a move, she just might.</p><p>The new oracle continues to tell Hobgoblin the history of the Black Tarantula. The stories tell of him him being around during the time of Marco Polo's first expedition of China. He became obsessed with mastering the martial arts and joined a cult of assassins that still supposedly exists to this day. His mastery of the arts lead to him discovering the secret of immortality. What may actually be the case is the tradition of the Black Tarantula was passed down from father to son.</p><p>After shopping with Davida, May changes into Spider-Girl and decides to visit the headquarters of the Fantastic Five to talk to Mr. Fantastic about the development of Ben's powers. She is greeted by a man is metal mask. She finds out that it's Franklin. He tells her it's a long story as to why he's wearing a \"creepy new look.\" He asks what she wants and she tells him to talk to his dad. Franklin tells her that he will be unreachable for the foreseeable future and if she wasn't so self-absorbed, she would've known about the recent events they've faced.</p><p>Swinging away, Spider-Girl comes across a mugging in an alley. She jumps down and violently takes out the three thugs, telling them that this is her neighborhood. Women and children are not to be threatened there. When one of them pulls a gun on her, she webs it up and begins to slap him over and over, saying he's made a \"fatal\" mistake thinking he could match her reflexes. Coming to her senses, she realizes that something is off. Seeing that the woman and her child are alright, she swings away.</p><p>Hobgoblin asks the oracle if she expects him to believe that Black Tarantula has never been defeated. She tells him that he has been defeated before. Both Spider-Man and the teenage Araña have managed to overpower the father of the current Black Tarantula. Hobgoblin says that he's not familiar with Araña. The oracle says that she operated from the shadows. Hobgoblin figures all he has to do is find her to discover how she overpowered Black Tarantula. The oracle says that won't be possible as she has taken it to her grave.</p><p>At Moose's house, May, Davida, and Courtney are visiting. He's still a little down as the condition of his father hasn't changed. He does have good news. He will be returning to Midtown High since his Uncle has been transferred to Queens. His cousin Donna will also be going to Midtown with them. Moose does let it out that he hates Spider-Girl since she was more concerned with killing Carnage than saving his father's life. He says a real hero would've found a way to do both. These words cut May deeply.</p><p>The oracle finishes the accounts of Black Tarantula, including his association with the Hand and his recent control over the Brotherhood of Scriers. Hobgoblin asks if there's any way to take him down. The oracle says may be a way, \"the Heart of the Spider.\" When he asks what that is and how can he get it, the oracle says no one really knows. She gives him a quote about the tarantula having fear and being defeated. Hobgoblin isn't happy over receiving \"poetry\" rather than a weapon and leaves. He figures the visit wasn't a complete waste as perhaps Spider-Girl has something to do with the \"heart of the Spider.\"</p><p>With the Hobgoblin gone, the oracle removes her robe to reveal, none other than Araña. Miguel turns up at her side and is surprised she told him she was dead. Araña says she doesn't want Hobgoblin searching for her as he searches for the \"heart.\" Miguel asks her if she think it really exists and she says it's possible. She hopes that the Hobgoblin will use his resources to find it and also take out the Black Tarantula.</p><p>May is walking home from Mooses and runs into Wes. He is in a hurry. She wonders what is going on. He tells her he's a little freaked out, but in a good way. Davida just asked him out. He is in shock and has to go tell Jimmy Yama and everyone else he knows. May continues to walk alone.</p><p>In the Hobgoblin's lair, he talks to Mindworm and the mother from the alley. Mindworm says he's managed to establish a psychic link with Spider-Girl and was able to push her. He says that as she struggles with her inner demons, she will easily be destroyed by them.</p>",

His feelings of alienation increase when her agent tells him he can't see her for the duration of the filming schedule. In the meantime, Ichitaka gets to know his new next-door neighbor, Aiko Aso. As the days pass, he finds himself growing attracted to her. Things begin to heat up when Aiko is abandoned by her old boyfriend. As Aiko becomes more available, and Iori drifts further away, Ichitaka has to decide whether or not to hold on to an increasingly impossible dream.</i></p>",
