            "description": "<p><em>The Inhumans are betrayed by one of their own. If their culture is to survive, Black Bolt must find Quicksilver. On Earth the word is out – Quicksilver is promising to restore lost powers to former mutants, and Magneto is not happy.</em></p><p>Genosha. Pietro remembers… </p><p>He explains the island state was once home to millions of mutants. This is where his father’s dream of power became reality, until Cassandra Nova, the evil twin sister to Professor Xavier, unleashed the Sentinels, and the dream was trampled beneath their iron feet. Pietro and Wanda gave Magneto his dream back. For a while, Genosha was the glittering jewel in the crown of their dad’s mutant empire. It was Pietro’s gift to him, and he threw it back in son’s face.</p><p>Pietro remembers how everything fell apart, and Magneto hang there in mid-air in front of him, furiously shouting at him what Pietro has done in his name. On that moment, Wanda said the magic words: “no more mutants.” Magneto ended up losing his powers, just like Pietro and Wanda themselves, and their dad finally knew despair. Today, of the sixteen million who once lived on Genosha, all that remain are a few demoralized former mutants.</p><p>Quicksilver has gathered these mutants around him, and explains to Wicked, Hub, Unus, Hack, Purge, Freakshow and Shola that he and Luna are offering them their powers back. All they have to do is say “yes.” It’s as simple as that. Wicked knows nothing is ever as simple as that. Hub wants to know why they are chosen, as there are millions of de-powered mutants all over the world. Unus asks Pietro where Magneto is, and if he knows what Pietro is doing. Hack thinks the discussion is stupid, and doesn’t see why they shouldn’t just trust Quicksilver. Freakshow reminds his friends that either way, they are running out of canned food. Shola recalls that Pietro told them those Mists restored his powers and asks for a demonstration.</p><p>Pietro agrees to give them that. He explains that before he... changing his phrase, Pietro states that, before M-Day, he was fast. Shola smiles that they all know that. But after that certain day, Pietro states, he was no faster than anyone else. Until he was exposed to the Terrigen Mists. To himself, Pietro concludes that actually, his powers are a trick of sorts. He time-jumps an hour into the future, walks a few yards and returns to the present. He demonstrates this power to the former mutants, and makes it seem like he has quickly ran behind them.</p><p>Purge is impressed at the speed. Wicked agrees to do it and inhales the Mists. Pietro explains the process will only take a few minutes. Hack asks Wicked if anything is happening. Wicked touches her head, and is thrilled when she sees her spirits are floating all around her again! Freakshow inhales the Mists next and transforms into a huge dragon. Purge gets his enhanced strength back, but Shola isn’t sure if he wants to do this. His explains his power has drawbacks. Every time he slept, he relived the death of one of the millions who died there. He thinks that, if he gets his power back, the nightmares probably return as well.</p><p>Wicked tells Shola it’s his choice to make. Personally, she would think having power to knock over tall buildings is worth a little pain. Purge tries to encourage Shola to inhale the stuff. He doesn’t know what’s in those Mists, but he never felt so pumped up before! A happy Wicked shouts this is so cool, as she has missed her spirit guys. Purge jokes to Shola that he hears Wicked admitting she digs rotting dead people. While Unus inhales the Mists next, Purge thinks this is a question of attitude. He thinks Shola just has to tell himself dead people are good and that they are his friends.</p><p>Pietro asks Luna if she sees it now. This is just the beginning. Soon as all the former mutants of the world will flock to him, he will restore them all. Luna takes off her sunglasses and her eyes glow. She thinks something is wrong. Wicked suddenly hears some spirits calling her a “wicked girl.” The scared girl turns around, and sees the spirits of... her parents?! Her dad wants to know why his daughter left them to die. Her mom states she always knew Wicked was a nasty, selfish little tramp. Wicked shouts she didn’t summon her parents and wants them to go back where they came from. Her dad doesn’t want his girl to tell them what to do. Wicked draws her parent’s spirits back inside her.</p><p>Hack asks her if she’s okay. Wicked mentions this wasn’t supposed to happen, as she doesn’t want her parents back. Pietro tries to calm Wicked down by saying she doesn’t have to worry about the few anomalies in her restored powers. Suddenly, a voice demands that Pietro tells the mutants the truth. It’s Magneto! Magneto, holding an unconscious Callisto in his arms, wants Pietro to admit that the Mists of Terrigen aren’t a cure, but instead a <em>curse</em>! He informs everyone that his son Pietro has poisoned them all!</p><p><em>Meanwhile, on Attilan, homeland of the Inhumans... </em></p><p>A heavily beaten up Jolen reveals to the Royal family that it was Pietro who murdered Goran and stole the Terrigen Mists. Medusa wonders how that’s possible, as Pietro went back to Earth ten days ago. How could he return there without their knowledge? Jolen says that Pietro has his powers again, but not just the speed. He can reproduce himself. He explains that, while Quicksilver was fighting him, there were three Pietro present! The three Pietro attacked without warning and beat Jolen up. Then, they vanished.</p><p>Gorgon wants to know if Pietro came for the crystals, he wonders why Pietro attacked Jolen. Crystal thinks it’s because Pietro is petty and jealous and spiteful. Gorgon doesn’t understand, but Medusa doesn’t think that’s important now. Their main concern is that Pietro can apparently teleport here from Earth at will. Videmus denies that. Pietro doesn’t teleport: he simply travels through time. He reveals Pietro was exposed to the Mists several weeks ago. They restored Pietro’s speed in a new form. He stole the crystals while he was still in Attilan, by traveling through time. Pietro took them when he left with Luna.</p><p>Gorgon becomes angry hearing that Pietro has had the crystals on Earth all this time, and that Videmus knew about it but didn’t say anything. Medusa tells Videmus that his king wishes to communicate with them. Videmus attaches his eyes on Black Bolt’s head, so they can telepathically communicate with another. Black Bolt wants to know why Videmus did this, because he thought that of all his subjects, he thought he knew Videmus best. In that case, Videmus says, Black Bolt knows he had the welfare of their people at heart. Black Bolt asks how that can be, as he doesn’t see what they are without Terrigenesis. He reminds Videmus he has endangered the very thing that makes them Inhuman!</p><p>Videmus denies that. He tells his lord that it requires more than a chemical process to make an Inhuman. Their race was forged in the heat of conflict, and that is what made them so strong. Videmus feels that here on Earth’s moon, Black Bolt has created a sanctuary. He has made everyone safe. And what, he asks, do they do in their complacency? They eat, drink and make merry! The young Inhumans know no challenge beyond the rivalry of the sports arena. Their battle skills degenerate. Videmus fears that, soon, their culture will be as barren as this dead rock on which they are squatting. He thinks he has given their people a reason to live. Now, they will experience the exhilaration of an uncertain place. Terrigenesis is not their right; it is a privilege, which should be earned through struggle and hardship.</p><p>Black Bolt asks Videmus if he thinks war is the glorious end he seeks. Videmus states he knows his lieges heart. He knows it irks him to be surrounded by pomp and opulence, that a life of ease doesn’t become him. Videmus feels he has given Black Bolt what his heart desires. Black Bolt angrily shouts at Videmus he doesn’t know him. How can he think that he would thank Videmus for this?! He demands that Videmus speaks, as he will pronounce his judgment on him.</p><p>Videmus knows that Black Bolt would have him condemned for his crimes. He promises to live out his natural life in solitary confinement. And, Videmus shall never again join his mind to that of another living soul, nor see again through another’s eyes. He accepts Black Bolt’s decree. Videmus takes his eyes back, and now can see nothing but black, cold space. Gorgon thinks Black Bolt is too merciful, and knows Videmus deserves death. Medusa tells Gorgon he is wrong about that. There is no mercy in Black Bolt’s judgment. As the guards take Videmus away, Crystal asks her cousins, if it isn’t too much trouble, if they will perhaps now help her find her daughter.</p><p><em>Genosha... </em></p><p>Luna happily runs towards her grandfather, and Pietro can’t stop her. Magneto is glad to see Luna again after all this time. When she wonders aloud what’s wrong with Callisto, Magneto explains to his granddaughter that Callisto told him that Pietro restored her mutant powers, but that it was different. Her senses became too acute. She couldn’t stand the pain, so she shut it out. Now, Callisto has gone into a deep coma. Pietro wants to take a closer look at Callisto, as she was fine when she left him.</p><p>Magneto angrily slaps Pietro in his face, demanding that he stays away from her. Pietro doesn’t take that slap as a surprise. After all, the last time they met, his dad tried to <em>kill</em> him. Only this time, Pietro grins, his dad isn’t Lord Magneto. He is just a man. While Pietro is so much more.</p><p>Pietro stands still, and reminds himself he has done this before with Jolen. He simply time-jumps thirty seconds into the future. Then he does it again, each time stopping at the same point in time, until two other versions of him appear to help out. All the Quicksilvers attack Magneto at once, who doesn’t understand what his son is doing. The Pietros all hit Magneto in his face, shouting at him that they owe their father this a hundred times over! Luna begs her dad to stop hurting her grandpa.</p><p>Shola agrees with the little girl. He doesn’t know what Pietro’s problem is, but he says Magneto has had enough. Pietro shouts that all he ever wanted to do was please his dad, but he barely acknowledge his existence! But he thinks that, now, Magneto has noticed him! Luna touches Magneto’s head. She can feel that he isn’t a bad person. He is just very sad. She glides her fingers through Magneto’s hair and sees lots of beautiful colors in him. Luna thinks she can help her grandpa out by taking away the sadness. Magneto wakes up and pushes Luna away from her, wanting her out of his head!</p><p>Luna says she was only trying to help. Magneto doesn’t want his ability to feel taken away from him! He knows Luna was shutting down parts of his mind. He doesn’t want her to do that to <em>anyone</em>. Luna wonders if that means she can’t use her powers. All of the Pietros tell Luna not to listen to Magneto. He explains she only has had her powers for a short while and is certain she will learn to use them without harming anyone. Magneto is shocked to discover Luna’s powers came from the Mists, and that Pietro used them on his own daughter. He can’t believe what kind of a monster his son has become. Quicksilver becomes furious, and doesn’t want Magneto, of all people, to tell him how to raise his child. He demands that Magneto gets out of here and crawls back into whatever rat hole he has been hiding in. He swears that if he ever sees Magneto again, he’ll kill him. Luna starts to cry and begs her dad to please not fight.</p><p>Magneto agrees to leave, but only for the child’s sake. He just wants Pietro to promise he’ll take care of Callisto. He has to bring her to the mainland, as she needs to be in a hospital.</p><p><em>A day later, at the Baxter Building in New York, home to the Fantastic Four... </em></p><p>Reed explains to his team and the Inhumans that sometime yesterday, the former mutant Callisto was taken to the Victoria Hospital on Mahé Island in the Seychelles. She was teleported into the middle of downtown traffic by the Genoshan mutant Hub. Hub later told him that Callisto lost her powers on M-Day, but regained them in an extreme form after being exposed by what Hub described as “a DNA-altering drug.” Reed’s guess is that the Inhumans will find Pietro and the stolen crystals on Genosha.</p><p>Medusa thinks Luna must be on Genosha as well. Ben recalls that they may have kind of butted heads with Quicksilver a few times in the past, but he’s confident he would never hurt Luna. Johnny tells Crystal he agrees with that. Crystal thanks Johnny for that, and hopes that he is right. Johnny smiles at her. Reed mentions he should warn the Inhumans their intel comes from communications between the Seychelles and the White House. He wouldn’t normally eavesdrop on the government, but this case is different. Medusa tells Reed Black Bolt understands and appreciates the FF’s friendship. All the Inhumans do. Reed admits that the point is that they aren’t the only ones knowing what’s going on in Genosha.</p><p><em>At the same time, at the Office of National Emergency, at the Pentagon in Washington DC... </em></p><p>General Lazer finds it hard to believe they are dealing with a DNA-altering drug. One of his co-workers confirms it’s actually that. But the guy has learned that the president is concerned. He explains they have been moving towards a position where the mutant situation was becoming controllable. The president fears that, if mutants are recovering their powers, it would be considered as a setback. The man adds that the situation in Genosha introduces an unknown factor, and the president would like that factor to be contained. Lazer totally agrees. He orders to scramble the ground troops; meaning squads Delta and Gamma. And, Lazer wants his jet prepared for takeoff. He will be leading this mission personally.</p><p><em>Back to Genosha, where... </em></p><p>Karnak reads on the scanner he received from Reed that the device is picking up two major groups and a number of solitary life forms. It discovers two individuals who appear to be teleporting, and one of them is too big to be human.</p><p>Not far away from them, Lockjaw stands alone, and howls.</p><p>Karnak continues to explain that the other person seems to be jumping randomly every few seconds, and just joined the group in the buildings they can see in front of them.</p><p>Inside one of the buildings, Hub teleports back to her teammates. She falls on the ground, and Wicked asks her if she’s alright and where she has been. When Hack asks if Hub succeeded in bringing Callisto to a hospital, Hub confirms and guesses Callisto is in good hands. But it’s taken her close to twenty-four hours to get back there. Her internal radar is definitely on the blink. She reveals that, in her last attempt to teleport back there, she ended up in the middle of the ocean, about thirty yards down. She knows if she had sunk any deeper, she would have blanked out.</p><p>Wicked calls that totally dangerous. Hub tries to dry her hair, and agrees with what Wicked just said. Hack guesses Hub’s radar will come back eventually. When Hub then asks how things are going, Wicked is ashamed to say things aren’t so good. Freakshow isn’t talking, and Hack thinks the poor guy is stuck in his monstrous form now. Shola has been acting weird as well. He woke up screaming last night, and Hack thinks Shola’s nightmares are back.</p><p>Nearby, an exhausted Shola desperately tries to stay awake, in order avoid the nightmares.</p><p>Pietro isn’t with them right now, and sometimes just disappears. He literally... disappears. And when the guy comes back, he just walks in like nothing happened. Purge is creeped out by Quicksilver. They all look at Luna, who keeps inhaling the Mists. Hack mentions that he heard Pietro talking about giving them all a second hit. He figures it will fix the glitches with their powers.</p><p>Suddenly, a large shadow appears above the youngsters. It’s an attacking Black Bolt! The Inhumans follow after their king and surround them. Crystal demands to know where her daughter, Luna, is. An angry Gorgon is eager to fight Pietro. Wicked asks her friends what they are going to do about this. Shola appears, and is certain the Inhumans will take back the Mists. Freakshow hears that and doesn’t like it, fearing that means he’ll stay trapped in his current ugly form. The kids open fire on the Inhumans, and the battle quickly rages on.</p><p>Pietro grabs Luna and tells her they need to leave. The two run away, and don’t notice they are being watched by Lazer and his troops. Lazer orders one of his agents to take Quicksilver out, and Pietro gets shot! He falls on the ground, dropping the container holding the Mists. Luna panics, but Lazer meets up with her and tells her it’s okay: they are Americans. Luna can’t believe they just hurt her father. She takes off her sunglasses and, with glowing eyes, stares at Lazer, promising he’s going to be sorry he just did that.</p>",

            "description": "<p>New York City: ‘Easy sis, I got you!’ exclaims Johnny Storm a.k.a. the Human Torch, formerly of the Fantastic Four as he swoops down in a burst of flames and grabs his sister, Susan Storm-Richards a.k.a. the powerful Invisible Woman, also formerly of the Fantastic Four, rescuing her from a group of S.H.I.E.L.D agents. One of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents radios to another squad, informing them that the Invisible Woman is being aided by the Human Torch. The agents take flight as they are ordered to stay in pursuit. But in the air, Johnny tells Sue to make them invisible, so she does.</p><p>In the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Director, Maria Hill, remarks that, it has to be said - flooding the streets with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents has made an enormous impact on criminal activity, and adds that if their agents keep this up, there might not be any need for those New Thunderbolts. An officer announces to the agents following the renegade former Fantastic Four members that Hill wants a sit-rep on them, and asks the agents if they have nailed them yet. One of the agents replies that they need another two minutes, and announces that they are switching to infra-red.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Stark Tower, long-time friend and colleague of Tony Stark, Happy Hogan meets with Kyle Richmond a.k.a. Nighthawk of the Defenders and Cassie Lang a.k.a. Stature of the Young Avengers, who until recently were allied with Captain America’s Secret Avengers team, and tells them how grateful he is that they are joining the Pro-Registration side. Happy adds that he knows it couldn’t have been easy for them, walking away from Captain America just like that.</p><p>The handsome Nighthawk tells Happy that it was probably the toughest decision he has ever had to make. Happy assures Nighthawk that he knows what he means. ‘Your head says “Tony Stark” but you heart wants things just the way they’ve always been’. Kyle tells Happy that, unfortunately, they are living in a different world now, and he supposes that it took Goliath to make him realize that.</p><p>Happy turns to Cassie and asks her if she is ready to just walk away from her teammates in the Young Avengers, pointing out that this is a big step she is taking here. Cassie remarks that people want heroes to be properly trained now, and points out that it is not the nineteen-forties anymore. ‘All I want is to do my job to the best of my abilities’. Happy tells Cassie that is great, before informing them that he will get them downstairs in a second or two for background checks, but that Tony Stark had said he wanted to welcome them both personally. ‘It’s not like the big guy to keep people waiting…’ Happy remarks looking at his watch.</p><p>Upstairs in Stark Towers, Tony “Iron Man” Stark, one of the front-runners for the Pro-Registration of super beings tells his teammate from the Avengers Peter “Spider-Man” Parker that he is acting like a lunatic, and suggests they sit down and discuss this like grown ups. Spider-Man replies by telling Tony that there is nothing to discuss. ‘I’m leaving the Avengers!’ Peter explains to Tony that he doesn’t have a problem working for S.H.I.E.L.D., but as for locking heroes in the Negative Zone, the Thor-clone killing Bill Foster, that he does have a problem with. ‘You’re in over your head!’ Peter exclaims.</p><p>Iron Man asks Spider-Man what he is talking about, pointing out that “Thor” acted like a police officer would have. ‘Don’t forget that Bill Foster was a friend of mine!’ Tony remarks, asking Peter if he really thinks they are going to let something like that happen again. He then asks Spider-Man what he thinks they should do with the unregistered super-beings - ‘Lock them up with regular prisoners?’ He assures Peter that this is only a temporary measure, but if they lock them up in Rykers, then they will be out in five minutes.</p><p>Tony tells Peter that he has to appreciate that there are forces within the government and S.H.I.E.L.D. who like nothing more than to outlaw all super humans. ’Get out of my way!’ is all Spider-Man replies, to which Tony tells him not to be a fool, and asks him if he really thinks he can just go back to his old life now that everyone knows who he really is. ‘This isn’t just about you anymore! What about May? What about Mary Jane?’ Tony asks, referring to Peter’s beloved aunt and wife. Peter responds by smashing Tony through the next wall</p><p>, then declaring that his aunt and Mary Jane are as far away as possible. Tony tells Peter that he is disappointed in him, and fires a repulsor beam at him. Peter easily dodges thanks to his enhanced agility, and replies ‘Not as disappointed as I am in myself!’ as he leaps towards a window, ready to smash his way through it - except that he just smashes against it, and falls to the ground. ‘Avengers Headquarters. Reinforced glass’ Iron Man remarks. At that moment, several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents rush into the room, telling Stark to stand back, that they have Spider-Man, and being firing dozens of bullets at him - except the bullets shatter the glass, and Peter forces himself out the high-rise window, ‘Stop! Hold your fire!’ Iron Man orders the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, except it’s too late. ‘Dammit!’ he exclaims angrily.</p><p>From the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Maria Hill radios in to Tony, telling him that she just got word Spider-Man has gone rogue, and orders Tony to remain in the area and wait for back up, as she is pulling every agent on the ground. Tony tells Maria to wait, that he just needs to talk to Spider-Man, but he can barely get the words out as Maria snaps back ‘Request denied, Star! Over and out!’</p><p>The Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. then radios to the Thunderbolts division, declaring that she wants fourteen operatives activated on a sixty minute trial. She remarks that she knows they were saving them for the final battle, but that the situation is critical. A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent stands in the Thunderbolts division, where waiting ready to go are fourteen of the Thunderbolts Army - Songbird, Atlas, Radioactive Man, Joystick, Venom, Bullseye, Lady Deathstrike, Taskmaster, Jack O-Lantern, Jester, Ox, Vector, Ironclad and X-Ray, the latter three being members of the U-Foes also.</p><p>‘I knew we couldn’t trust that guy!’ Maria snaps, referring to Spider-Man, who at that very moment is running through a sewer. An officer reports that they have Spider-Man’s location, between Third and Fourth Street, adding that word from the street says only minimum force will be required.</p><p>Suddenly, a little toy skates along the water in front of Peter. ‘What the -?’ Peter exclaims before the toy blows up, sending him crashing back in the sewer. The Jester stands over Spider-Man, asking him how it feels to be on the wrong side of the law and for the Jester to be wearing a sheriff’s badge? Jack O’Lantern flies over Spider-Man on a flight-device, as he tosses some gas down towards Spider-Man, and exclaims ‘Man. You gotta see who we’re hanging out with now, Petey. Jester and me, we’re finally on the A-List!’</p><p>‘Oh, baby! This is just too awesome for words!’ Jester shouts as he tosses a yo-yo at Peter, which explodes as it smacks into Peter’s chest. ‘You want fries with that, honey?’ Jester asks he smashes Peter to the side of the sewer. Jack O’Lantern bares down over Spider-Man, grabbing him by the neck the third-rate villain exclaims that this seemed like such a bum deal at first, working for S.H.I.E.L.D., forced to do what they say. ‘But when word from the top says “kick the crap outta Spider-Man” Well, what can we do? We’re only obeying orders, right?’</p><p>Jack O’Lantern forces Peter up against the wall of the sewer as Pete, badly wounded, replies that he just wanted to do the right thing, before asking the villains if they know his girlfriend died of a broken neck. The villains ignore Pete’s comment, and Jack O’Lantern suggests they have some fun with him while he is still stoned from the gas-bomb. But someone from S.H.I.E.L.D. radios to the villains, telling them that if they lay a finger on Spider-Man they will get five thousand volts. ‘You really think we’re gonna let you freaks run around without a leash?’ the agents asks, before telling them that S.H.I.E.L.D. support is on its way, so they just need to cuff Spider-Man and sit tight.</p><p>‘Spoilsport’ mumbles Jester, when suddenly, two bullets are fired, one smashes Jack O’Lantern’s pumpkin-head open, and the other hits Jester in the side of his head. ‘What the Hell? we’ve lost visual!’ the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents remark. Spider-Man cowers, thinking he is in trouble, until he realizes that he knows this mysterious rescuer. ‘I know you, skull-face guy…I know you from way back, don’t I?’</p><p>Meanwhile, on the 32nd Street, S.H.I.E.L.D. vehicles race past an alley, where a woman and a man, both with black hair, are standing The woman asks her companion if he thinks they saw them. ‘Even if they did, what’s there to see? We’re not the Human Torch and the Invisible Woman anymore - we’re Mr and Mrs Landau and we’re out for a midnight stroll!’ Johnny replies to Susan.</p><p>Approaching a door, Susan remarks that she is still annoyed that Fury couldn’t find them any brother and sister identities. ‘Pretending we’re a couple is the creepiest thing I’ve ever done!’ Johnny asks Susan how she thinks he feels. ‘You look like my last date’s grandmother!’ before remarking that their disguises let them get out there to help people, which is what is important.</p><p>The heroic siblings enter a large meeting room, where Captain America and his “Secret Avengers” are all sitting. Black Mamba, currently of Bad Girls Inc and formerly of the Serpent Society, goes to the door and tells everyone to take it easy, as it is Johnny and Sue back from a mission. Luke Cage asks the Storms’ if they heard what happened to Cloak and Dagger. ‘No. What happened?’ Johnny asks. Captain America informs them that Tandy and Tyrone got busted over atQueens, which means their Baxter Building raid needs to be revised, as he was counting on Cloak for his teleportation abilities.</p><p>The badly injured Cap slams a fist down on the table, ‘Damn S.H.I.E.L.D. units!’ he exclaims, remarking that they have lost a man for every one they have gained over these past few days. Hulkling of the Young Avengers suggests that he could raid the Fantastic Four’s files, shape-shifting into one of their staff and waltzing through security with no problems. Cap informs Hulkling that he has a bigger job for him in Arizona, before announcing that the Invisible Woman already has an equally pressing assignment.</p><p>The usually quiet Bonita Juarez, better known as the uber-powerful Firebird asks Captain America what could be bigger than stealing the plans for the Negative Zone Prison? ‘We get in there and free our people, and this starts looking like a fair fight again!’ the former Avenger exclaims. ‘Why the Hell does he call it <i>Number Forty-Two</i> anyway?’ Rachel Leighton a.k.a. Diamondback asks. ‘Knowing Tony Stark it will have something to do with his mother’ Sue replies.</p><p>Suddenly, the door opens, and Frank Castle a.k.a. the Punisher stands there, holding a bloody Spider-Man, the anti-hero shouts ‘Get me a medic! NOW!’ Sam Wilson a.k.a. the Falcon is shocked to see the Punisher, while Captain America calls out to Dr. Jane Foster and Linda “Night Nurse” Carter. Punisher carries Spider-Man over to the med-room, and Jane asks what happened to him. Punisher replies that Spider-Man has multiple fractures and has sustained serious blood loss thanks to Tony Stark and his buddies, adding that Peter seems to have ingested some kind of hallucinogen at the same time.</p><p>Several of the other heroes enter the med-lab also, and Ultra Girl exclaims ‘Iron Man? I thought Spidey was so far up his butt you couldn’t see his feet anymore’. ‘Yeah, well, he’s on our side now!’ Punisher exclaims, to which the Falcon asks the Punisher what he means by that. ‘Since when were you on this team?’. ‘Since the other guys started enlisting known thieves and multiple killers!’ Castle replies. Monica Rambeau a.k.a. Pulsar of Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. and formerly the Avenger known as Photon asks if she is the only one laughing her guts out at the irony of this.</p><p>Punisher asks who they think has been running around in a ski mask these past few weeks, covering their backs. ‘Way I see it, you people need all the help you can get!’ the Human Torch asks why they don’t just call up Hannibal Lecter and ask if he is available too. ‘Because Hannibal Lecter hasn’t got the black ops training to get you into the Baxter Building!’ the Punisher replies. Dr. Walter Newell a.k.a. Stingray, a former member of the Avengers exclaims ‘Please tell me we aren’t so far gone that we’re signing up the Punisher!’</p><p>Luke Cage tells Cap that this is his call, and asks if they hand Punisher over to the cops or do they hear out what he has to say. Cap just tells Cage to be quiet, as he is thinking. In an adjacent room though, Greer Grant Nelson a.k.a. Tigra sits in the shadows, listening to her former friends and teammates, while she records their conversations for the Pro-Registration team!</p><p>Meanwhile, in Hell’s Kitchen, Danny Rand a.k.a. the new Daredevil is led away by several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and Reed Richards a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic, and Jennifer Walters a.k.a. the She-Hulk, a renowned lawyer, and former member of the Fantastic Four stand as the former Iron Fist is led away. Reed remarks that this is horrible. ‘The public’s behind us, the government’s behind us. Crime is at an all-time low. Why are our own people the only ones causing problems?’ Reed asks.</p><p>Regretfully, Mr. Fantastic remarks that sometimes he wishes they’d never got involved. ‘Do you ever stop to think how much easier things would be if we hadn’t spliced Thor’s DNA with Hank Pym’s cyber-tech?’ he asks. ‘If we didn’t have this big final battle planned with all those Thunderbolts lunatics? Hank wouldn’t be doped up on anti-depressants and my darling Sue would never have left’.</p><p>‘Maybe not’ Jennifer tells Reed, before pointing out that that public opinion would have forced S.H.I.E.L.D. to bring down every super hero in America. ‘People were sick of sixteen year old kids blowing up buildings, Reed. You guys gave us all a future!’ Jennifer tells her friend, trying to comfort him.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Ryker’s Island Penitentiary, flanked by agents, Tony Stark leads Daredevil to the dimensional portal to take him to <i>Number Forty-Two</i>. Stark tells Rand that he has to understand why they are doing this. ‘We don’t take any pleasure in hunting down our friends!’ Tony assures him. Tony explains that they are backing these reforms because the only other option is a complete ban on all super heroes, and nobody wants that to happen.</p><p>The group walk through the gateway and enter the Negative Zone as Tony explains that their big idea is to have fifty super teams spread over all fifty states, each one licensed and accountable to the taxpayer. ‘It’s the next step in super human evolution: a federal force from coast to coast!’ Tony reveals to Rand that he has been working on this for months, creating new super heroes and revamping anyone who wants to join. He assures Daredevil that he would be at the top of their list if he was interested, and could even have his own team.</p><p>Motioning around to the sprawling <i>Number Forty-Two</i> complex, Tony remarks ‘Nobody wants to put you in jail’, before asking Daredevil if they can talk. One of the agents tells Stark that Daredevil has barely said a word since they brought him in, but that they did find this silver dollar under his tongue. ’He said he’s been saving it for you’ another agent reveals as he hands the dollar to Stark, who replies ’A silver dollar? I don’t understand’.</p><p>‘Guess that’s thirty-one pieces of silver you’ve got now, huh?’ Daredevil remarks sternly before being led away, leaving a perplexed Stark behind. ‘Sleep well, Judas’ Daredevil calls back.</p>",

Things are going exactly as planned for the villainous cabal...</em></p><p>Elongated Man suspects something is wrong; the world's supervillains are serving humanitarian causes and no one from the Justice League is responding to their allegations (or answering his calls). Martian Manhunter frees himself from Gorilla Grodd's psychic assault and realizes that the League faces a unified conspiracy. Brainiac and Lex Luthor acknowledge a mutual professional enmity, but agree to work together nonetheless. Brainiac hands Luthor several small spheres.</p><p>The Atom is in the hospital with Jean Loring at his side. Black Canary, seeing a fear-induced hallucination of Green Arrow lying dead, screams (with her Canary Cry); the two drive off Clayface and the Scarecrow. During her struggle with Wonder Woman, the Cheetah slashes Diana's face, arms, and body with her claws; although Wonder Woman nearly subdues her foe, the villainess manages to escape. Green Lantern is lost in a space void, with his ring providing him life-support. Hawkman and Hawkgirl survive Toyman's attack.</p><p>Superman is rescued by Captain Marvel and the two travel to the Batcave for help, but Batman and Alfred, under the control of microscopic mechanical worms, attack them. Elsewhere, Luthor realizes that Brainiac plans to betray him, just as he will betray Brainiac — and throws the small orbs he has been given into the ocean. The orbs enlarge and become the model cities.</p><p>Superman realizes that he too is infected with the mind worms, and instructs Captain Marvel to throw him into the sun to burn them out of his body.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Getting to hang out with Iori in preparation for a school event was, by near and far, the biggest and brightest highlight of lovelorn Ichitaka Seto's life. Sadly, just like all things in life that are too-good-to-be-true, his time with Iori was just that--too brief. But what's this? The original I's team is reunited on a school trip to Kyoto, and Ichitaka and Iori get to visit a temple renowned for forming loving bonds between those who pass beneath its hallowed gates. Will this ancient sanctuary of divine bliss succeed in eternally uniting Ichitaka and Iori, or will yet another Itsuki-related emergency forestall Ichitaka's chances for true love with the girl of his dreams?</i></p>",

They have no idea that it’s actually a wicked spell conjuring up evil spirits that intend to kill their sensei! More troubling is that with each passing minute, the strongest spirit eerily devours the other apparitions and grows ever more destructive. Since the spirit can’t be stopped, there’s only one way to save the sensei: Turn the curse around onto the students who initiated it! Mai and Naru clash mightily on this case, as Shibuya Psychic Research must choose between the sensei and the students...and time’s running out!</i></p><p>File 4 - 8.</p>",
