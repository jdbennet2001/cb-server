            "description": "<p><em>Spider-Girl and The Fantastic Five join forces to defeat a robber at the Fantastic Five museum.</em></p><p>Peter is up for an award directly from the Mayor, which is the topic of discussion at breakfast. May vows to be at the ceremony in time. At school, May is talking with Davida Kirby when Jimmy Yama breaks into the conversation. He asks May if she would like to go the new Fantastic Five showing at their base. Before May can answer, Moose Mansfield shows up with Brad Miller to mock him. However, Brad convinces Moose to back off and says how both groups of May's friends should go after school. They all do make it there after school and things seem to be going fine enough until a portal shows up in the middle of the room. Out of this dimensional doorway swaggers Spyral. It turns out he is looking for a Negative Zone device so he can get back to his right dimension. As May begins to engage him as Spider-Girl, the Fantastic Five shows up and jumps the gun by assuming she is working with Spyral. Before things can get straightened out, Spyral puts the public in danger and is able to get away as Reed Richards saves the crowd. May is also able to change back into her normal clothes before the Fantastic Five can capture her.</p><p>As she makes her way home, she is stopped by Phil Urich, he fathers partner as Midtown South Police Station. They have a conversation where he reveals to her that he once tried to be a superhero. May contemplates why he may have told her this a bit later as she watches for the Fantastic Five to go after Spyral. When they finally do, she follows them to the seedy warehouse 317 and assist them in their fight. Spyral is able to get the upper hand and May, along with Franklin Richards, are sent into another dimension, but with the Negative Zone technology. They try to fend of the creatures there as they wait for the rest of the team to bring them back, which they do. With Spyral in custody, The Thing and Johnny Storm want to hold May, but Franklin vouches for her, allowing her to leave with no questions asked. May hastily makes her way to her fathers ceremony, but she is already too late. The comic ends with Mary Jane and May walking away from each other in frustration.</p>",

            "description": "<p>In Siberia,circumstances have separated Wolverine, Colossus and Nightcrawler during their visit to the area around the Ustordynski Collective. Wolverine, after succumbing to the deadly touch of the misshapen mutant Nikolas, had been taken to the military reseach camp, Province 13. The facility director, General Sergei, watches as his medical team examines the captive mutant, whose healing factor is barely keeping him alive.</p><p>Colossus and an elderly woman, Ariana, hide in a cave overlooking the collective. He is protecting her from Russian soldiers who had come to take her into custody, but she still exhibits disdain toward him. Also, she warns him he and his allies will be captured by Sergei.</p><p>Memories from years earlier flood her mind and she tells Colossus of the birth of her son. The child came into the world grotesquely misshapen and cursed with a death touch only his mother had been immune to. Before long, Sergei had led his officers to Ariana’s home and had taken possession of the infant.</p><p>As she saw the Rasputin children grow up to display mutant abilities, she resented them since they had looked normal and could avoid drawing the government’s attention, unlike her taken child. Sadly, Colossus departs for the village in hopes of learning something about their current situation.</p><p>At Province 13, Nightcrawler succeeds in teleporting into the facility. He briefly watches Sergei and Alexei, the General’s superior there for an assessment of the value of Province 13, then he telports into the playroom where the psychic girl, Nanya, and three other children play.</p><p>Sergei leads Alexei back to his office where he gets the news from his superior: the decision has been made to shut down Province 13.</p><p>In the playroom, Nightcrawler learns Nanya is telepathic, but none of the other children are mutants. He is about to resume his search for Wolverine, but promises the children he will return for them.</p><p>As morning arrives, Omega Red, who has been brought back to Russia from exile, finds Ariana in the cave and accosts her. Colossus returns in time to save her and the two do battle. Soon, they are found by Nikolas. Omega Red hurls a boulder at the creature, and both Nikolas and Colossus find themselves tumbling down the mountainside. Some time later, Nikolas recovers and runs off, following the trail of Omega Red and Ariana.</p><p>In the medical lab at Province 13, Wolverine’s condition worsens, and he flatlines. Despite the researchers’ insistance that they continue to examine his body, Sergei orders them to dispose of it, as the facility is to be closed. As they argue outside the empty lab, Nightcrawler teleports in and gathers Wolverine’s gear.</p><p>That night, outside Province 13, the soil of a shallow grave stirs. From the ground, Wolverine’s clawed hand emerges.</p>",

            "description": "<p> Dracula and Dr. Charles Seward leave the quarantined town of Littlepool, where the entire populace has died, victims of an artificial virus that originated from Seward's anti-vampiric serum.  Dracula, also suffering from the effect of the serum, compels Seward to lead him to the doctor's employer, upon whom he intends to exact his revenge.</p><p>On the way to the employer's facility, Seward thinks about his family and how, despite the fact he took on the serum project in hopes of protecting them from vampires, it has instead hurt his chances of reconciling with his wife, Jane.  At the same time, Jane ponders recent events, fearing her husband may have had something to do with the deadly plague.</p><p>Upon reaching the facility, Dracula kills the bodyguard and comes face-to-face with the employer: his own daughter and eternal adversary, Lilith.  She recounts to her father the events of recent years: When Dr. Strange eradicated all vampires from Earth, Lilith found her eternal rest.  But when Dracula was resurrected, so, too, was she, doomed to resume their conflict.  She then went on a rampage at Castle Dracula, destroying or stealing his most prized possessions.  Selling the items to Audra Pennington, a London auctioneer, she became able to finance the development of Seward's anti-vampiric-serum, all ignored to destroy her father.</p><p>Enraged, Seward finally breaks the mental control Lilith had him under, and he lunges in an attempt to inject her with the serum.  She lashes out, killing the doctor.  Now with no one to correct the serum, Dracula flies into a rage, attacking Lilith.  But in his weakened state, he struggles to gain the upper hand.  Finally, he pins Lilith to the wall with a shard of broken wood.</p><p>Remembering that Seward theorized that his own blood immunized him from the virus, Dracula sucks the blood  from the doctor's corpse, an act that is taboo amongst vampires.  Lilith mocks him accordingly.  As Dracula had hoped, Seward's blood counteracts the effects of the serum, and he begins to recuperate.</p><p>Using chemicals he finds, Dracula sets off an explosion that destroys the facility.  He then proceeds to Littlepool and calls down a massive lightning storm to wipe the town from the face of the earth, effectively removing all traces of the virus.  Lilith, having survived the explosion, arrives with parting words for her father.  Neither can ever directly kill the other; they are cursed to enmity forever.</p><p>Two nights later, Dracula sits on a hall in his restored castle.  With him is Audra Pennington, who sits entranced.  He muses aloud with irony that he had just saved the world.</p>",

The jaws of a gigantic trap are busy closing up on them and crushing them.</em></p><p><em>The last Russian contact of Alpha was brutally murdered and his database stolen. The only hope of getting back on track for the $ 500 million is now on Assia and her family! Some of them, however, have nothing more urgent than to hurry packs of killers on their heels or use them as pawns in their service. The epilogue is on the horizon, deadly for many. Secret services and mafias are brewing their weapons for the final round. Major upheavals and betrayals are taking place in all the camps ... Does Alpha really have no more assets?</em></p><p><em>The eventful conclusion of a first triptych set in post-Soviet Russia.</em></p>",
