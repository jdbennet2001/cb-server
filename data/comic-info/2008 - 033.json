And...oh yeah...X-Factor's new digs! What do we have to do, put it in your hands ourselves?! <br />   </p> <p><strong>Summary <br /> </strong>Longshot and Darwin are in Detroit and Longshot is heckling  random gangbangers to test his luck powers. Evidentially, they work because they attack Darwin instead of him. He continues to yell stupid comments, aggravating them further.</p> <p> Hector Munoz is at X-Factor Investigations. He whispers to them he has heard they specialize in mutants. They assure him he doesn’t have to whisper, their office isn’t bugged. CUT TO; van outside – Agent Val Cooper, listening in on the conversation. Munoz says he used to be a drunk and when his wife blamed him for their son, Darwin, being a mutant, he left. Now he would like them to help him find his son.</p> <p> Back to the street brawl, the geniuses ‘bangers have finally figured out that Darwin is a mutant. Longshot is still heckling and Armando finally has enough. He books it out of there, running extraordinarily fast, so they then turn to Longshot. A young woman is watching, and when Longshot gets away, she follows, transforming into a Skrull. Longshot hears something, looks back, and the Skrull then turns into a mouse.</p> <p> X-Factor is examining a photo of Darwin and Jamie assures Mr. Munoz that if Darwin is in Detroit, they’ll find him.</p> <p>Later, Jamie and Guido are meeting Agent Cooper in a bar. Cooper tells them that the Munoz case has to take the backburner for her. Jamie tells her to forget it, and she says that the only reason that they haven’t been arrested yet is- “We’re Americans with rights protected under the constitution?” Jamie finishes. Strong Guy spits out his drink and asks Jamie to warn him next time he’s going to make a joke. In the end, Cooper gives them another 24 hour deadline to deal with the Darwin thing or she’ll “take it off at the neck.” </p> <p>Longshot and Darwin meet up again and Darwin spots their stalker. He points ‘her’ out to Longshot, who recognises her. They take off after her, and she reports it to someone named “Jennifer” that she’s been spotted, just before the thugs go after her this time. She tells him to hold it, and he shoots at her. She shoots back, causing Darwin to attach her. She is about to shoot him in the face when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40460\" href=\"/m/4005-40460/\">Monet </a>comes out from nowhere, taking her down without any effort.  But as Monet is restraining the unknown Skrull, She-Hulk charges at her.</p> <p> </p> <p>TBC in <a data-ref-id=\"4000-134099\" href=\"/she-hulk-he-loves-you-part-2-of-3/4000-134099/\">She-Hulk #31</a>    </p>",

Hal and Sinestro continue to battle  Abin Sur's killer, but will these two Green Lanterns become enemies before they  become friends? And what strange secrets within Abin Sur's power ring concern  the massacre of Space Sector 666?<br/><br/>In Hand Mortuary, in the basement of his home, William is seen gazing at corpses while there to be embalmed. He is caught by his mother and questioned as to his Christianity. <br/><br/>Back on the airfield, Hector continues to read their minds and now focuses on Hal's. He learns that Hal is the Green Lantern and about his training in the Green Lantern Corps. Hector becomes jealous of Hal and his potential powers and turns hostile. Hal, with all of his will power begins to fight back as the Green Lantern. Being a rookie he struggles getting his ring to do what he wants. Sinestro to the rescue! He comes and subdues Hector and swoops off with Hal on another assignment.<br/><br/>On their way out Sinestro chastises Hal for flying without his ring and for not being prepared for the scuffle with Hector. Sinestro admits that he was suspended himself when he was a rookie for accusing the Guardians of the Universe for putting the yellow impurities in the universe.<br/><br/>This other assignment turns out ot be visiting Abin Sur's shallow grave in New Mexico. While near the gravesite Hal's ring is triggered and Abin Sur's message--which was recorded on the ring before he died--begins to play for Sinestro.<br/><br/>Abin leaves a message for Sinestro telling him about the massacre of sector 666 and the five remaining survivors, \"the Five Inversions\". He said they were a \"terrorist cell bent on the destruction of the Guardians of the Universe and chief among them was Atrocitus\". He goes on to mention the prophecy of the \"darkness\" and that it could be found on Earth.<br/><br/>Sinestro surmises that Abin mostly perished--not from the crash of the space ship--but from an attack by Atrocitus. He figures out that Atrocitus must have survived the crash and is now at large on Earth searching for this \"darkness\".<br/><br/>Back at the funeral home, William is ushering a hosted funeral for a family where he is greeted by Atrocitus. Just then both Hal and Sinestro swoop down and attempt to arrest Atrocitus. <br/><br/>To both of their surprises, Atrocitus has in his possession a Cosmic Divining Rod...</p>",
