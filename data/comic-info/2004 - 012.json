            "description": "<p>In Italy, Hyperion tries to explain to Zarda why he still wants to be a hero, still wants to help people, even though he knows that the basic premise on which his life was constructed was a lie. When Zarda learns that Hyperion is ready to help people whether they want him to or not, she decides that there is an opening in his mental process which will allow them to accomplish their objective (conquering the Earth). Hyperion heads off, and Zarda goes to Rome to \"shop\" (since she is now and has been for the past few issues, fully nude). The stores are closed, but this is not any concern to Zarda, nor is her lack of money when she identifies the clothing she intends to take. She moves on to jewelry. When Italian police attempt to stop her from taking a spear from a statue in the city square, she kills them with it.</p><p>In Chicago, Kyle Richmond (Nighthawk) and the Blur continue to investigate the source of the pile of 83 left arms they found while investigating the serial murders of black prostitutes. Nighthawk calls in Hyperion for assistance because of the super-powered nature of the killer, over his own objections (since Hyperion is white and therefore not trustworthy). The Blur leaves Richmond to his own devices after he realizes that not only is he a raging racist, but that he is just as prejudiced when it comes to super-powered beings. Hyperion arrives in Chicago just after midnight, and Nighthawk shows him the evidence that he's gathered about the super-powered serial-killer. Nighthawk insists that Hyperion directly or indirectly caused the rise of super-powered beings, and in his own greasy way, impugns Hyperion's manhood to goad him into taking action. Hyperion heads back to his apartment and finds that the government has been ransacking his home trying to determine more about him, and his motivations. Even more insulted and disgusted by the government's treatment of his property and plans on ways to control him than he was by Nighthawk's attitude, Hyperion burns the apartment to the ground with his heat vision and returns to Chicago.</p><p>In Washington, Doctor Steadman asks Joe Ledger about the blackouts that he has been experiencing, where the crystal takes the drivers seat and leaves Joe locked in the trunk. Steadman is concerned that the crystal took him to the bottom of the ocean for some reason that Joe is not disclosing. Joe doesn't mention the amphibian creature he met there. On their way out, Joe notices Doctor Fraser, and (presumably at the crystal's prompting) suggests that Steadman should follow her to learn what she's hiding. When Steadman follows Fraser, he is accosted by military guards. When he is brought to Fraser, Steadman learns that she has been experimenting with the alien DNA from the cradle-ship that brought Hyperion to Earth. Steadman identified the DNA found on the ship as a combination of human DNA and alien DNA. They speculated that the DNA may have caused the enhanced abilities of people like Stanley Stewart (the Blur), and injected the combined DNA into a military volunteer who died in the test. Given the death, they continued their trials, this time on convicted killers serving life sentences in military prisons. When Steadman threatens to take the information public, the military implies that they will kill him rather than allow it. Joe Ledger appears from nowhere to defend Steadman's life.</p><p>In Shreveport, a shack sits with an old pickup truck in front of it, the door opens, a man comes out and drives off in the truck. Hours later, the man returns in the truck with a street prostitute. They enter the house, the prostitute noticing the smell of death as they enter. Some time later, we hear the woman being attacked, she runs out of the house and is chased by the man, who returns with her left arm.</p><p><b>General Notes</b></p><p>This issue is presented with four panels per page, showing the simultaneous stories of Zarda, Nighthawk/Hyperion, Doctor Steadman, and the super-powered serial killer.</p><p>Richard Isanove contributed inks to the cover only.</p><p>As Nighthawk is looking in a mirror on the cover, Gary Frank and Richard Isanove have their signatures reversed, as they would be if placed in front of a mirror.</p>",

The thrilling conclusion to Emma's first solo adventure!</em></p><p>Winston is on the television preparing to accept any demands from the kidnappers. The kidnappers take off Emma's mouth cover but she mumbles jiberish and so they had the camera guy put it back on her. He tells her he's sorry but Emma talks to him telepathically replying \"Sure you are.\" Winston continues to make contact with the kidnappers and they demand to get two-thirds of the money before they release Emma. Emma is helplessly chained onto a fence when she tries to read her mind, she sees the death of Troy in the leader's mind and vows to make them pay for what they did to Troy. Just when they were about to kill her she talks to the other three kidnappers and begins to play mind games with them. She tells them that the leader is just going to take the money all for himself. One of them decide to ask how they are going to split the money and the leader tells them they are splitting it equally, the rest of them decide to agree with it. Emma begins finally projecting images into the kidnappers mind, making the leader and only the leader see Troy. He begins to notice that it might be because Emma is doing something. Some of them begin to question him and now he points a gun at one of the other kidnappers telling himself that he doesn't trust anyone. He grabs the leader's girlfriend and points a gun to her head. The leader shoots her anyways and everyone begins to open fire. The girlfriend was actually still alive and wakes up and shoots the leader dead. The camera guy helps Emma escape in which Emma goes to the place that the ransom was supposed to be left for the kidnappers, Emma takes the money and gets ready to board a bus. She is also shown to be blonde now, suggesting that this is when she dyed her hair blonde.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The mysterious homeless girl seen around Salem Center turns out to be a powerful mutant - but convincing her to come to the Xavier Institute could be a dangerous task!</em></p><p>Josh is being rushed on a gourney to the Med Lab, being pushed by Dani, Karma, Laurie, Beast, and Nurse Annie. Annie doesn't want to believe Laurie when she says that it was Rahne who did this, but Karma raises the question of whether Josh would even be able to give Rahne her powers back. Beast then reveals that Josh is an Omega Level mutant, who can manipulate the body's functions on a genetic level. So yes, he's powerful enough to do that.</p><p>Laurie is not allowed inside the Med Lab once they arrive. She is freaking out because they're calling for Warren, and any other mutant healer they can find: medicine won't work here...</p><p>Dani suddenly realizes that she knows where Rahne is. With the return of Rahne's powers, Dani's telepathic link with her returns as well! Dani rushes off to talk to Rahne.</p><p>After Dani leaves, David, Sofia, and Noriko arrive. David and Sofia do their best to comfort Laurie, and Karma invites everyone inside to sit by Josh's side. Nori refuses to go in though, because David is there. Sofia speaks with Nori about Josh's condition, and how she's a not very nice for not caring, even though Josh was the one who led everyone to find Nori. Noriko says it's not about Josh, but David. David pretended to be Nori's friend, even though he judged her for using pills to control her powers. And now he's pretending to care about Josh, even though he judges Josh for everything he does as well.</p><p>Sofia then shows us why we love her in this scene, where she gives Nori a stern talkin' to.</p><p>*<strong>Sofia:</strong> \"Maybe this school is <strong>not</strong> the place for you. You obviously prefer life on your <strong>own</strong>, with no one to <strong>care</strong> for you or <strong>prevent</strong> you from making mistakes. You won't get that here at Xavier's. Here, we are a <strong>family</strong>. We take <strong>care</strong> of one another. We <strong>protect</strong> one another. And yes, we <strong>criticize</strong> one another. It is your <strong>choice</strong> whether or not you wish to be a <strong>part</strong> of this family.\"*</p><p>In the Med Room, Laurie runs away in tears, because she knows Josh will die. Sofia runs after her. With just David and an unconscious Josh in the room now, Nori walks in. She and David talk, and David explains his relationship with Josh. Nori realizes David is just being the responsible one again. He acts like an older brother should act. Nori explains about her family and how she ran away.</p><p>Dani goes to the Salem Center Slums, to the area where they found Noriko. Rahne is harassing a homeless man, and then takes his spot! Dani shows up, and Rahne attacks her as well. Dani defeats Rahne, and they have a little chat. Rahne doesn't think she can control the wolf anymore, but Dani knows better, and she doesnt need a telepathic link to tell her that. Rahne finally transforms back to her human form, and the two walk home.</p><p>Back at school, Laurie explains how she finally chose to use her powers and had some control over it. Sofia is happy for her, but they overhear some bad news... Warren can't come back for another hour, but by then Josh will be dead. David and Nori think up a plan. They realized they dont need Warren, Josh is a healer too! They just need to wake him up. David is picking up all of Annie's and Beast's medical knowledge, so he knows what meds Josh is on, and how to undo the IV and everything else. They plan on taking Josh off his meds, and having Surge shock him awake.</p><p>Beast tries to stop them, but as usual, David is right. Nori shocks Josh awake, and he moans in agony, because he's got a huge hole in his body. Laurie grabs his hand and places it on his chest. David offers some encouraging words.</p><p>*<strong>David:</strong> \"Don't leave us now, buddy...we were just starting to <strong>like</strong> you.\"*</p><p>There's a blinding flash of light, and Josh wakes up... golden! He doesnt know why everyone's staring at him. Or why he's crying. He feels all goofy and happy (but that's Laurie's fault). This is when Nori quietly slips away... she doesn't do \"kodak moments\". Josh will have to get used to this new look, but the group is just happy that he's alive right now. He and Laurie hold hands and share a tender moment as he thanks her for saving his life.</p><p>Just then, Dani and Rahne walk in, and Josh forgets all about Laurie for the moment. He tries to mack on Rahne again, and calls himself \"the man\" for bringing her powers back. Rahne storms out, Dani rolls her eyes, and Josh is just confused.</p><p>*<strong>David:</strong> \"We <strong>definitely</strong> need to work on your <strong>people skills</strong>.\"*</p><p>Later that evening, Dani comes back to talk to Josh alone. He apologizes for being such a hassal, and suggests that she let him switch to another advisor. But Dani won't have that. She explains that now, she is officially Josh's legal guardian. So if she's tough on him, its because thats how parents are supposed to act.</p><p>The next day, Dani and Nori walk down to The Grindstone to apologize to Luna. Surge explains what happened, and then asked to pay of her debt to Luna by working at the Grindstone. Just then, the group walks in and orders some drinks. Luna prepares them, and Nori delivers them to the laughing group at a table by the window.</p><p>This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship!</p>",
