There are no bodies to speak of, no known victims, no explanation for how or why the blood appeared. But Robert Bellarmine -- whose cleaning crews get called in to take care of the weirdest jobs, the ones the cops can’t or won’t handle -- can already tell that both his advanced medical training and his scientifically skeptical mind will be pushed to the limit as he sets out to find a rational explanation for these sudden eruptions of gore. And when ten-year-old Henry Lisander goes missing the next day, Bellarmine knows he has even less time to figure out who or what is behind the bloodbath!</i></p>",

Get ready, this is going to send shock-waves that will ripple throughout the Marvel Universe. Hail Hydra!</i></p><p>Baron von Strucker is in his undersea headquarters Ichor, watching the Skrull battle Earth's heroes. He then asks the infiltrators in his base to show themselves. The Skrulls do so, planning on taking him out to take control of Hydra. However, Strucker defeats them easily with his Satan Claw. He demands to one of them as to how many infiltrators are in Ichor. The Skrull answers that they have endless numbers. Rather than rooting out all the Skrulls that had infiltrated his organization, Strucker destroyed Ichor killing humans and aliens alike. He escapes the base's destruction, planning on conquering the world rather than owning it. Strucker rebuilds Hydra, posting recruitment through colleges and stealing S.H.I.E.L.D. technologies. However, his aide de camp, Ms. Fischer informs him of Nick Fury's discovery of the Carousel base in Chicago. Strucker then comments that they both had been dancing for years and finally his nemesis hears the music. He then decides to call in an inner circle, comprised of Kraken, Madame Hydra, The Hive, and Viper. However, they are missing one person.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nick Fury is with Daisy, explaining the revelation of S.H.I.E.L.D. being Hydra, which makes everything he had done for decades to be a complete lie. He tells her that now, they are going to wake up and get even.</p><p>Daisy joins the rest of the Secret Warriors to dinner. Phobos then reveals that he can see the future and prophesies about each member: The Druid will become a great hero; Slingshot will get hurt but Stonewall will care for her; Daisy will do a great job soon and Hellfire will die.</p><p>When the Secret Warriors arrive back at the Cocoon, Fury briefs them on what's happened. The war they will fight will require no mistakes. He then says that one of them has to go undercover in Hydra.</p><p>Meanwhile, the new inner circle of Hydra attack The Hand at one of their temple, forcing the monks there to revive Gorgon. The grandmaster, however, demands Strucker's head, to which Strucker agrees. Unfortunately, the Hand finds out too late that Strucker had tricked them, as Gorgon's remains consumes them, turning them to dust.</p>",

The orderly reports he never got admitted. Strange as she knows he and his family got put in an ambulance.</p><p>Alice needs a drink and has Peter take her to a bar where she gets drunk and Peter has to carry her home.</p><p>Back at Base the new chief has arrived and is not having a good first day, a zombie has turned up that is unaware that it has passed away. They put him in a holding cell until Alice comes in. When she finally arrives, hungover, the zombie explodes releasing a massive ghost Chinese dragon into the building. Alice drags the new chief to help as she combats the dragon with a riot-shield and spike. Much to her surprise again the spike is not enough to take down the Dragon and even more surprising the zombie is still conscious and this dragon is not its ghost.</p><p>the Zombie has in its chest a series of wires that a kindly Alice talks to the zombie in a gentle way as she explains shes going to yank out the wires. She does and the suppressor tower shreds the dragon, the wires were some sort of power supply for it.</p><p>In the morgue they discover that the zombie had been a mule, carrying a ghost inside it for Yanis, he recruits the poor non-citizens gets the to traffic a ghost but the flasks fail and kill the host. they theorize that this technology has been developed in order to weaponize blue-light, so you can deploy demoralizing and dangerous entities on a battlefield.</p><p>Homeland Enforcement has been alerted when radiation was detected in Love's autopsy lab from the containment flask.

            "description": "<p>Basic Plot:</p><p><i>The prequel series continues, as young police officers Chun-li and her partner Po-lin are hot on Shadaloo's trail. Plus, a pivotal moment occurs in the life of everyone's favorite loser, Dan Hibiki, as Dan's father faces off against the King of Muay Thai - Sagat!</i></p><p>Detailed Synopsis:</p><p>The issue begins two years previously, as Chun Li and Po Lin go through a shooting course at the Hong Kong Police Academy. Chun Li goes first and beats the best time, but then it's Po Lin's turn and she beats Chun Li's time. Next we see the two of them speeding through the academy, their only real competition one another (except in hand to hand, where not even Po Lin can compete with Chun Li). Then it's graduation day, and Dorai tells his daughter that he is very proud of her and thanks Po Lin for keeping Chun Li on her toes, telling her that she is the sister Chun Li always wanted. He snaps a picture of the two of them together, and then we're back in the present.</p><p>Chun Li (or \"Chunners\" as Po Lin calls her) and Po Lin are discussing what they know about Sagat. Chun Li says that \"before hooking up with Shadaloo he was a decorated fighter, with countless championships under his belt.\" She says that why he joined up with Shadaloo is unknown, but that he has become central to their operations in Asia.</p><p>Elsewhere, the lawyer for the two Shadaloo thugs Chun Li and Po Lin took down last issue gets on his phone. He informs someone that he has retrieved the work schedule that one of the thugs had on him as Sagat requested, and that he will fax it to him shortly.</p><p>Later, at the Hibiki dojo, Dan and his father Go are preparing to lock up when Sagat enters the dojo with his Shadaloo toughs in tow. He says that there is something that he and Go have to address, but Go tells him that, unless he wants to sign up for classes, he has no business with Sagat and his men. Sagat says that any challenge to his men is a challenge to him and his authority. \"You can see why this requires a response.\" Go responds that anything he wants, he'll have to take.</p><p>Turning to his men, Sagat tells them that they are not to interfere. At the same time Dan tells Go to show Sagat what the Hibiki school is made of, and with a thumbs up, Go tells his son that this will be quick.</p><p>Then the two men are fighting. Sagat quickly overwhelms Go, sending him crashing through his storefront window. Sagat then turns to his men, voicing his anger at them for being unable to subdue such a seemingly weak opponent themselves.</p><p>Sagat's words enrage Go, who flies at the Muy Thai fighter with a devastating jump kick. The attack connects, and its impact robs Sagat of his right eye.</p><p>Overcome with rage, Sagat unleashes his full barrage of \"TIGER\" attacks on Go, brutally beating the man to death in front of his son, Dan. \"BASTARD!\" Dan screams, flinging himself at Sagat, but the massive Muy Thai fighter catches him by his face and flings him aside. As Sagat and his Shadaloo toughs walk away, Dan vows to one day be strong enough to avenge his father. \"FATHER!\" He cries.</p><p>Later, the police are on the scene, including Chun Li, Po Lin and Dorai. They ask Dan if Sagat is the man who killed his father, but Dan says that the only one who has business with his father's killer is Dan, himself. \"My father took his eye, and one day I'll be there to finish what he started!\" Dorai tells Dan that no parent would want their child to destroy their life obsessing over their death, but Dan still refuses to help them.</p><p>Regardless, Dorai is convinced Sagat is responsible. Chun Li points out that Dan said that Go took his killer's eye, and they decide to start checking hospitals for Sagat, with Dorai saying that if that doesn't work he can try contacting another source that he has. As they talk, the three of them fail to notice a pair of shadow cloaked individuals watching them from inside a nearby parked car.</p><p>A bit later, Chun Li and Po Lin are in a hospital where a nurse is leading them to the room of a man they just treated for a \"nasty eye injury,\" but when they get there the window is shattered and the room is empty.</p><p>Outside we see Sagat, one eye heavily bandaged, inside a large jeep. He tells the driver to take him back to the gym that is acting as his Hong Kong HQ. Once there, Sagat dons his trademark eyepatch for the first time, then tells his men that they have work to do.</p><p>The next day, Dorai is eating a meal inside a nice restaurant and tells the waitress he would like to speak with the chef. She says he normally doesn't see customers while he's working, but Dorai tells her to tell him that his fried rice \"is the best in town, but it could still have been a little lighter on the sesame oil.\" She does so, and returns shortly saying that the chef will see him, and that he said to tell Dorai that he wouldn't know how to season a bowl of instant ramen.</p><p>In the kitchen, Dorai says hello to his old friend Gen, but says that he isn't there for the food. \"That is what I suspected.\" Gen replies.</p>",

            "description": "<p><b>Overview:</b></p><p>Chris Powell's house has been destroyed and his mom is badly injured. Before he knows what's happening, he and the stranger are attacked by what the stranger, named Talon, calls a Hunter Drone. They manage to take down the creature after Darkhawk switches armor to form a strike suit, but Talon warns that more will be on their way. Chris heads to the hospital to check on his mom who lies in a coma. Mickey has a long dig at him for not giving up the armor sooner, but Chris tries to explain that it's a part of him and he cannot give it up. Talon then shows up and Chris attacks him. Their fight quickly comes to a halt as Talon explains exactly why he is there. He has come to join the only other member of the Fraternity of Raptors - namely 'Designate Powell.' They are the only remaining raptors and they have a duty to bring order to the chaos that is taking over the cosmos. Chris reckons that's a pretty tall order. He takes time out to attend a meeting of Excelsior and explains the situation. Mickey understands and promises to watch over his family while he's away. Chris then heads outside, joins Talon, and enters a stargate.</p><p><b>Full synopsis</b>:</p><p>(Long Island)</p><p>A massive explosion has torn apart the home of Chris Powell: Darkhawk. He tries to remain calm, but it's not really in his personality these days. However, if there was ever a time to be angry, <i>now's</i> the time.</p><p>Chris looks around at the devastation and then remembers that his family are somewhere in the mess. He finds his mom who lies under some burning timber and grabs her, along with his two younger brothers. He thanks God that they're breathing and he flies away from the house, asking Mickey to call 911. She asks what that thing was that crashed into his house, but before he can answer, the stranger informs 'Designate Powell' that it would be better for them if they left the area, now. He should listen to the datasong. It says that the Hunter Drone that was chasing him is still alive. Chris turns to him and orders him to get away from his family. \"Who the **** are you?\" he asks. \"I am Talon,\" replies the stranger.</p><p>The pair of them are hit by a blast of energy. Chris asks what just shot at them, before looking around and seeing a massive creature with red eyes and large claws; seemingly metallic in composition. \"What is <i>that</i>?\" he asks. Talon informs him that it's a Drone Hunter, sent to eradicate their kind. \"Our kind?\" Chris asks. Talon explains that they are the Fraternity of Raptors. Does he not know what he is? Chris replies that he doesn't know anything. He crashes into his backyard and then this monster levels his home. What the **** is going on, and how does he keep his family out of it? He blasts the creature but doesn't even scratch it. It powers up and assaults him again, only this time, Chris somehow manages to reconfigure his costume subconsciously. He is surprised by the change. He's never been able to do that before.</p><p>Talon says that the datasong was wrong about him. His bond to the amulet, though faulty, is deeper than anyone could have suspected. He calls Darkhawk Designate Powell again, and tells him to make haste. He should use the strike suit he's reconfigured and coordinate his attack with his own. Chris struggles to understand what just happened, but Talon asks him to save his questions for later. They need to survive the next few seconds. Chris feels supercharged, and Talon suggests he use that energy against the Hunter. Target its weapons array while <i>he</i> immobilizes it. \"You can control the change?\" asks Chris. Talon informs him that strike suit mode should serve their purpose against this foe.</p><p>He asks Chris to stay airborne and says that he can hit the Hunter with a micromunition assault (rockets) while it's distracted. Chris asks Talon, whatever he's doing, to do it fast. He doesn't like the way this Hunter is looking at him. Talon's missiles strike home, and Chris celebrates, for a moment, before realizing that the creature is still alive. It grabs Chris in its massive golden claws and Chris is forced to cut himself free. Talon then asks Darkhawk to follow him in. They will target the Hunter <i>together</i>. With their combined weapons, they attack the creature one more time, and this time the explosion tears the Hunter apart. \"Nicely done, Designate Powell,\" remarks Talon. Chris asks why he keeps calling him that. Talon explains that he is a designate; a novice. A raptor in training. Chris has no idea what he's talking about, and asks once more how he changed his armor like that. Talon explains that it's called reconfiguration - his amulet's ability to draw variant armors for use. All he needs to do is to focus on his old armor and he will transform back. Chris tries but it doesn't seem to work. Talon asks him to relax and feel the amulet's pulse. The armor then disappears, leaving Chris in his human form.</p><p>Mickey is still there to see his transformation. Talon informs him that his armor responded when he was surprised... another subconscious reaction which he finds puzzling. He tries to continue speaking but Mickey interjects, telling him now isn't the time. Chris asks about his mom and his brothers. Mickey tells him that the paramedics are there. His brothers are stable, but him mom... she's sorry. Chris asks to be taken to her, but Talon thinks that there are more pressing matters. Chris warns him to leave him alone. He brought all this down on them. As soon as his family's safe, he is owed some <i>serious</i> answers.</p><p>(Long Island Hospital - later)</p><p>Mickey informs Chris that his brothers are okay. The doctor's say they have mostly cuts and scrapes. She got them some hot chocolate from a machine. They must be fine as they're arguing over who gets the marshmallows. Chris looks at his mom who is lying comatose in a hospital bed. He counts slowly, trying to reign in his anger. Mickey doesn't think that his anger management techniques are working too well. Chris asks what <i>that</i> means. Mickey asks if he's going to get angry with her now. Fine. She's outta there. Mickey chases after her, but Mickey tells him that she's waited long enough. She <i>knows</i> that he has anger issues, but she's tired of excuses. He's always telling her that he's got it under control, that he's got a new technique and that he's a new person, but then he flips out again and goes crazy. Everything seems to set him off. Every last thing. She's sick of hearing his excuses. Can't he see that he's making excuses and blaming everything but <i>himself</i>? She points at Chris and says it's him. It's <i>all</i> him. It's the armor. From the moment he found it it's messed him up.</p><p>Chris tries to speak, but Mickey is on a roll, furious at Chris for messing up, not only his life, but those of his friends and family, too. The armor makes him angry, and crazy. He's got to get rid of it before it ruins his life completely. Chris replies that he can't. It's bonded to him. he can't let go of it. \"Can't you?\" asks Mickey, \"Can't you <i>really</i>? Or is that just the addiction talking?\" Chris says it's not like that, but Mickey replies that it is. She thinks he loves the power and the rush of being a big, angry tough guy. \"<i>No</i>,\" replies Chris, but Mickey says in that case, give it up! Give it up and be a normal guy. Or, he can go get help, maybe from Talon. Chris balks at the idea. Talon's the reason his mom is in a coma! Mickey asks him to listen to himself. Talon was on <i>his</i> side; fighting on <i>his</i> side.</p><p>Chris holds his head in his hands and feels his anger brewing. He changes into his Darkhawk costume and looks out the window to see Talon hovering there. Mickey gets out of the way quickly as she knows things are about to kick off. Darkhawk crashes through the window in anger, and Talon informs 'Designate Powell' that his friend is advising him not to fight. Chris hates being called Designate Powell and warns him not to call him that. Talon asks what he <i>should</i> call him. \"Darkhawk,\" replies Chris. \"I'm <i>Darkhawk</i>! He takes a shot at Talon using his chest plate, but it misses and Talon tells him that he is an angry child playing with toys he doesn't understand. He responds in kind, blasting Chris and sending him hurtling backwards. Talon informs him that he's come a great distance and at great cost to find him. The <b>Fraternity of Raptors</b> is needed now, more than ever. The galaxy needs them and they are the only ones left. He punches Darkhawk who reels from the power.</p><p>Chris replies that he's talking crap, but Talon says he came to teach him about what he is. He came to find his last comrade in arms. He came to help save the <i>future</i>. Chris takes a swipe at Talon and tells him it doesn’t mean anything. Talon vehemently replies that it means <i>everything</i>. He needs to help him untangle his mind. The raptor armor wasn't built for humans. He has never properly bonded with it, and its alien presence in his head is driving him insane. See for yourself, he adds. With that, Chris's amulet emits images of events unknown to Chris. Black Bolt, Lilandra, Vulcan and other raptors are shown alongside massive space ships.</p><p>\"Wh-what was that?\" Chris asks. Talon informs him that it's the past, the future, a glimpse of the memories stored in his armor. A predictive flash of the variables that wait to be aligned. \"Aligned?\" asks Chris. Talon continues to add that they need to be aligned by the raptors. He showed him the chaos in his head. The overload of data has been pouring into his head since he and his armor were first joined. He's tried to shut it out, explain it away or ignore it. All the time it's been there - driving him crazy and making him angry. \"Because the armor wasn't built to fit humans?\" asks Chris. Exactly, replies Talon. He found the armor by accident, but it was never intended for him.</p><p>Chris asks about the Hunter Drone that they just fought. Talon informs him that it was sent by their enemies; those who oppose the work of the raptors. He should understand that the Hunter was the first of many. So long as he is bonded to the armor, they will keep coming for him and his family will be caught in the crossfire. Chris asks if he can be taught how to use the armor and <i>fit</i> it. Talon says this is why he came across half a cosmos to find him.</p><p>(later, the basement of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Manhattan)</p><p>A meeting of Excelsior is taking place. Johnny, Chris, Namie, Mickey and Julie are in attendance, as well as two other males. As is the custom, Chris introduces himself to everyone and they all say hi. Chris tells them that he appreciates them coming out on such short notice, and he knows that he's caused them a lot of trouble recently. He hasn't exactly been a model member of the group. Johnny asks how his mom is. Chris tells him she's okay, but she's still in the I.C.U. At least the doctors are hopeful. That's actually why he came tonight. He wants to keep this simple.</p><p>He explains that he became Darkhawk by chance. The armor's given him some great adventures and friends. There've been some amazing times, he confesses. However, it's also <i>damaged</i> him. It's been screwing with his head; some sort of 'incompatibility' problem between alien tech and human software. He knows that they might not believe him, but it's the truth. So, he adds, he's sorry for all the pain he's caused. The group listens patiently as he continues to inform them that he now has a chance to learn how to become Darkhawk for <i>real</i>. It's make or break time. He masters it, or he gets rid of it forever. It seems to be so important. The Darkhawk armor is tied to something so big, he barely gets it. Mickey, standing with her arms folded, asks if he's going away. Chris shrugs and replies that if he remains, he'll put others at risk. There are things hunting him and last night one of them almost killed his mom. He can't be here, drawing these things to his family.</p><p>He adds that he needs to go away and sort out this mess. He doesn't <i>want</i> to leave his mom and brothers, but they're safer without him right now. He was hoping, maybe, if he could ask them to keep an eye out for them while he's gone. \"You know it,\" Mickey assures him, before giving him a big hug. Chris thanks her. \"Come back,\" she says. \"I will,\" he replies, \"For you.\" Chris then departs, leaving Excelsior behind. Once out the door he transforms into Darkhawk and sees Talon flying above him outside the church. He asks when they start. Talon tells him right now, if he's ready. Chris asks what he is. What is 'Designate Powell.' Talon informs him that he is a raptor, one of two in existence. The raptor armors were forged eons ago to equip those who would serve as architects of the universal fate. \"That's a pretty vague job description,\" quips Chris. Talon adds that raptors are sworn to use all their considerable skills and powers to safeguard the advance of galactic culture. They influence, they adjust, they shape and they improve. They are the curators of history and the custodians of the <i>future</i>.</p><p>Again, Chris jokes that there's no pressure, then. Talon continues to explain that there have been no raptors at work in the galaxies for millennia. He has only recently awoken from dormancy. Without the stable, guiding hand of the raptor fraternity, universal culture has been sliding out of control. They are <i>needed</i>, now more than ever. \"To do <i>what</i>, exactly?\" replies Chris. Talon spreads his wings wide, and informs him that war is about to reshape the landscape of the cosmos. They need leverage; influence, if they are going to perform their role for the greater food. They will start in a place called the <i>Negative Zone</i>. Chris says that he's heard of it, but how do they get there? Talon takes to the air, and asks him to follow. Darkhawk takes off in pursuit, heading skywards until they disappear into some kind of stargate.</p><p><i>My name is Chris Powell. I'm Darkhawk, and everything I thought I understood, just changed</i>.</p>",

But is it really The Dark Knight? If so, why is he acting so strangely? And if not, is this a threat that could mean the destruction of Gotham?</i></p><p><i>This three-issue series continues to shock and surprise, as the battle shifts to the next level with a face-off and ending that will have everybody talking. Who has earned the right to be Batman? Who thinks they deserve it? Robin? Nightwing? Jason Todd? Who will ultimately win the BATTLE FOR THE COWL? \"</i></p><p>This issue opens with Two Face at the Docks thinking that it was the Penguin that took out his arms shipment and planning a retalitory action against him, shift to Penguin who is aware of Two-Face's Predicament and therefore wants to make a move before Face can.</p><p>Shift to Damian and Nightwing chasing the \"Batman\" with Nightwing deducing that Jason is the man under the cowl. Jason comments on how they both want the same thing yet their methods are different, then proceeding to shoot Damian in the chest, Huntress and Black Canary arrive, but Nightwing tells him that Jason is his.</p><p>Nightwing brings Damian back to the cave to stitch him up and Alfred comments on how Dick should be the one wearing the cowl more than any of the other \"Children.\" Dick discovers that Tim has taken a batsuit to go hunt Jason down.</p><p>Black Mask is progressing with his plans to cripple Gotham and brings in Jane Doe and Firefly to cause death and destruction. At the GCPD Gordon and the new DA Hampton, discuss the bus hijacking with Gordon believing the Penguin to be respoinsible, Hampton says he needs more evidence than just Gordon's \"hunch\" Zsasz cuts off a face of a Officer and gives it to Doe who infiltrates GCPD and shoots the new DA in the neck, and shoots Gordon who was wearing a vest, therefore not being wounded. Firefly and Adam Bomb blow up some buildings causing death and destruction. Black Mask watches over the burning city from a rooftop</p><p>Tim find's Jasons hideout, an impromptu Batcave that has been wired with traps and explosives, after being saved by Catwoman who followed him both are attacked by Jason, with Catwoman being knocked out at the begining of the brawl. Tim follows Jason around the cave until he lands in a clearing filled with curtains, resembling of a house of mirrors per sa. Using a speaker system Jason taunts Tim to become his Robin as he looks rediculous in the Batsuit, while striking from the shadows slicing him with a Bat-A-Rang, before turning to pumeling him with his fists, Tim gets the upper hand with a crow bar he finds on the ground and beats Jason with it, Jason laughs in response as the Bat-A-Rang he was attacking him with is now embedded in the center of his chest, Tim collapses blood flowing, and Jason walks away stating there's \"just one left now.\"</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>As the Ultra-Humanite holds Manhattan and Power Girl hostage, he tells the parts of his origin that have never before been revealed. And what Power Girl learns chills her to the bone…</i></p><p>This issue begins with the Ultra Humanite giving Power Girl a beat down. At the same time he begins to dialogue and tell her his motivations for what he is doing. His big plan is to place his mind into Power Girl's body, and he had to use the entire island of Manhattan as hostages to get her to surrender it. During their fight Power Girl taunts the Humanite, and he ends up revealing his origin.</p><p>Before he tells it, we see the supporting players at Power Girl's new Environmental company, and how they are dealing with their city being lifted off the ground.. They all agree that the best thing to do is to sit tight, but then they notice people are jumping off the roof to save themselves.</p><p>On street level, the JSA is fighting the Humanites robots, all the while the conversation they are having over the sound of punching metal just so happens to be about Power Girl. As we cut back to Power Girl and Ultra Humanite we see that he has her strapped to some sort of device. As he is preparing for the mind transfer, he tells her why she can not break her bonds, and then tells his story.</p><p>As a child named Gerard he had cancer. Instead of laying in a hospital bed, he decides to go back to college and find a cure for himself. Unfortunately for him, the college found his experiment to transfer the mind of a human into an animal to be cruel and expensive and they kick him off campus along with his assistant Satanna.</p><p>They found a home in the African Jungle where a revolution is taking place. In a desperate attempt to keep Gerard alive, his assistant Satanna suggests putting his mind into the body of a great white ape. Of course we know the operation is a success. What we didn’t know is after he gets the ape body he takes out a regiment of soldiers and then gets to do the bad thing with his assistant Satanna.</p><p>After he tells his story, he decides that the sight of blood on Kara is sign enough that the transfer should begin.</p>",

JOE franchise in ways we've never imagined!</i> <br />  <br /><i>Summery:</i><br />The Joes team surround Duke and insist that he hand over the briefcase to them, but he resist despite being outnumbered.  Ripcord soon joins him but everything is still at a stalemate.  General Hawk explains that his unit will be handling the transportation of the high risk weaponry, but Duke refuses saying that he was the one appointed for the task and that he will follow through.  Hawk gives in but insist that his unit accompany Duke and Ripcord seeing that they are now undermanned and under-armed.   <br /> <br />While inside the Joes aircraft, Scarlett treats Ripcord's injuries while Duke converse with the others.  Soon, they arrive at the Joes base called the Pit.  They are greeted while at the Pit and General Hawk gives them a tour and explains the G.I.Joe mission.  They eventually reach a room where James McCullen is awaiting them.  The McCullen before them is reveal to be some form of holographic projection for communications purposes.  McCullen and Hawk discuss the attack on Duke's convoy.  McCullen asks if they can still deliver the case to NATO, and Hawk replies that it is unwise to expose them before the mysterious attackers are revealed and dealt with.  McCullen agrees, but he asks if he can examine the warheads first and he does so.  As he finishes he ends the holographic projection and Scarlett asks Breaker and Heavy Duty for their input; while Breaker couldn't make heads or tails of the voice analyzer, Heavy Duty believes that McCullen is working an angle. <br /> <br />Elsewhere at MARS lab, McCullen is revealed to have been in cahoots with the dark haired woman called Baroness.  They argue about their failed mission, but are glad that they manage to secretly activate the tracking device on the case to locate it's position.  McCullen leaves and meets with the Doctor where he demonstrates his latest creation, the perfect soldiers.  The Doctor explains that he has injected his test subjects with nano technology which makes them fearless and completely obedient.   McCullen impressed orders the Doctor to send a troop to rendezvous with Storm Shadow and Baroness. <br /> <br />Back at the Pit, Hawk tells Duke that he is now the custodian of the briefcase and that Duke's mission is complete.  Duke unwilling to leave tells Hawk that he wants in on the new task.  As incentive, Duke reveals that he once knew the Baroness and a curious Hawk listens. <br /> <br />In Paris, France, the Baroness returns home to her husband.  As she makes her way to her bed chamber, she is greeted by Storm Shadow who tells her that they will be going after the warheads at dawn. <br /> <br />Hawk and Duke continue to talk about Baroness and her past.  Hawk asks Duke if he is able to kill Baroness and Duke says that he will if he has too.  Duke and Ripcord get acquainted with the rest of the Joes.  Ripcord is especially interested in Scarlett.   <br /> <br />Hawk alone in his office does some paperwork until a knock is heard on his door.  It is Cover Girl who asks him for a few signatures for some documents.  As Hawk signs them, Cover Girl is impaled through the chest by a dagger.",

The elite school's subdued reputation for being haunted prompts the students to hold a half-hearted seance—and summon a ghoulish apparition from the underworld! The fiend leaves one student dead and throws the other five into a state of terror as they try to escape from Crestview's fancy new library. But as the six cliquish students realize why they've come together, they can only wonder: Is it a vengeful phantom trying to kill them off, or someone within their very own group?

It may be the best thing that's ever happened to gossip blogger Sergio Bauntin, whose columns about Rex bring him new levels of notoriety. In this chapter, Rex's secret origin is revealed, along with clues to why he's back, and hints about what the mob has to do with all this. It's Astro Boy meets Mister X by way of David Lynch, as only Los Bros. could do it!</i>",

But the GDS guns-for-hire soon discover that they are in the midst of not one, but two civil wars, one of extraterrestrial origin. And while the brutality and ruthlessness of mankind is well documented, it is nothing compared to the heartless savagery exhibited by the star-spawned Predators, especially when warring clans of the alien terrors are each sworn to wipe the other from existence.</i>",

Now she has become the target of both Gotham City's heroes (who don't take kindly to a new person wearing the cape and the cowl) and its villains (who want to see the entire Bat-family six feet under)!</i></p><p>Stephanie Brown continues her fight as Batgirl. As she fights more thugs she remembers her conversation with Barbara earlier. Barbara berates her for continuing to fight crime, stating that she already \"died\" once. Barbara downplays Stephanie's wishes to help, saying that she used her autopsy photos to dissuade the last last person who wanted to be Batgirl. Stephanie tells her it's none of her business why she wants to do this, Barbara throws a Batarang at the door telling her it certainly does. Barbara warns her that the Bat on her chest is a target for anyone who wants to make a name and to remember that the next time she wants to play pretend.</p><p>In Philosophy class she begins a conversation with two students in which she answers a question for the class and begins to like college a litte bit. After the class the girl who answered before her, bumps into her and knocks her stuff out of her hands. Francisco helps her and invites her to a party later on. Barbara, meanwhile is talking to a mortician as Oracle. He believes Oracle is a man, which makes Babs angry. Back to Stephanie at the Harvest Festival, she runs into a drunk Jordanna again. However it is revealed that the punch was spiked and Jordanna is having some kind of reaction to it and calls for someone to dial 9-1-1. As she does this a man runs away and Stephanie pulls out her costume.</p><p>As Batgirl confronts a group of gang members they don't buy her as Batgirl. Barbara, who made the suit she is wearing has a comm link in the suit and tells her she told her so. As Batgirl fights the group, she gets some subtle help for Barbara and when the suspects begin to flee Barbara tells her to heold her position. In her bunk Oracle's computer system seems to be frying, so she calls Alfred to see if the Cave Key is where it always has been.</p><p>In the Batcave, Stephanie and Barbara use the computers to identify the suspects at Gotham Harvest. As Stephanie walks around the cave she notices the original Batgirl costume in a case, Barbara tells her its nothing to aspire to. The only way you get your costume on display is by retiring, being murdered, becoming someone else, or getting shot. Barbara again tells her that she is pretending to be Batgirl. Stephanie wonders if this is about her or Barbara, and tells her that she can't keep her out of this, this is something she started. As Barbara leaves the cave she tells her to stop or she'll call her mother.</p><p>As Detective Gage transports a criminal he escapes and in the process kills a uniform. The criminal escapes and returns to the Scarecrow, the person behind these events.</p>",

His healing factor's down, and the only thing that'll juice it up is a dose of the Incredible Hulk's blood administered by the Weapon X alumnus who helped make Deadpool what he is in the first place! Not even mad science can mend a torn heart, though, as Deadpool's infatuation with X-Force's Siryn (later of X-FACTOR) is challenged by Typhoid Mary who turns heads as easily as she cracks skulls! When she sets off on a grudge match against Daredevil, can Deadpool contain a killing machine even more off kilter than he is? Also featuring wily weapon-boy Weasel, hostage extraordinaire Blind Al and the Taskmaster, later of AVENGERS: THE INITIATIVE! Collecting DEADPOOL #2-8 and #-1, and DAREDEVIL/DEADPOOL ANNUAL 1997.</i>",

But what starts out as a simple quest for information ends up as a rampageous firefight. And just when it seems things couldn't get worse, the Hardcore Twins, Luki and Noki, show up to \"play.\" Which is when things really get interesting… Boasting furious action, switchback plotting, magnetic characters and dazzling art, Dogs tells the story of four people struggling to survive a dystopian urban future by gun and sword and courage and luck. Driven by their ghosts--both dead and alive--and a desire for truth, their paths converge in the dark, labyrinthine heart of the city streets.</i></p><p>The second volume of the on-going series, this continues the story of DOGS: BULLETS &amp; CARNAGE, and includes the bonus story DOGS: HARDCORE TWINS which was originally featured as a special one-off tale in ULTRA JUMP Vol. 1, printed in 2003. Therefore the bonus story pre-dates the BULLETS &amp; CARNAGE story by two years.</p><p>Contains 204 pages and a small single-page colour poster on the inside cover.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>12.

Horrible and unexplained murders have Gotham City held captive. Bizarre deaths have been occurring throughout the city, but the perpetrator is unknown. Even when the crimes have been committed in view of witnesses, all that is seen is a glimpse of a weird, skinless \"meat-man\" who seems to fade away after the crimes. Gotham's only hope is their Dark Knight Detective, but how can Batman find and fight an Invisible Man?</i>",

Continuing the on-going series of mini-series, Jimmy the Rabbit, Jay, and Danny Wormwood, the Anti-Christ himself, are back in a new full-color six issue series that promises to provide everything you love about Ennis! This sacrilegious artifact is available with Regular and Visions of Hell Wraparound, both by series artist Jimenez, and special retailer incentive Anti-Christ Edition! Danny has his hands full when his lovely girlfriend Maggie drops a huge surprise on him, and Jimmy the Rabbit gets into all kinds of things he really shouldn't. More troubling is the fact that Jay seems to be switching back-and-forth from being normal and kinda slow, all while the new forces of Hell are planting the seeds of Danny's destruction. Series artist Oscar Jimenez provides the stunning cover and interior art. Ennis drags the whole world into the gutter with his trademark razor-sharp dialogue, biting wit, and the stunning art of Jimenez, all in full-color.</i>",

From the creator of THE AUTHORITY and PLANETARY comes the craziest, nastiest, most soulless and criminal superhero comic of the year! SUPERGOD issue 2: south-east Asia is on fire, an artificial angel whose brain is a faulty radio to God has been loosed on the world, something unimaginable is rising in China, attempts to reactivate America's superhuman in his underground fake childhood town are not going well, nuclear winter blankets the world -- and things haven't even gotten BAD yet. This is what a superhuman arms race would look like. This is what asking to be saved by men who can fly would look like. Take every superhero comic ever published, shove them into a nuclear-powered blender, soak it in bad vodka and set the whole thing alight -- and SUPERGOD will crawl out and eat your brain! This five issue color series is drawn by Garrie Gastonny with colors by Digikore. SUPERGOD is available with a Regular cover painted by Felipe Massafera, a Wraparound by series artist Garrie Gastonny, and a special retailer incentive Church Of Supergod Edition!</i>",

            "description": "<p><i>Vector is an epic story with repercussions for every era and every hero in the Star Wars galaxy. Told in four chapters, this is the concluding volume. In Chapter Three (Rebellion Volume 4) Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia have to deal with Vector as it crosses their paths and changes the galaxy! On the dark surface of a desolate moon, Luke meets his first Jedi since Obi-Wan Kenobi, only to realize too late that Celeste Morne is far different than his fallen friend -- twisted by a Sith Talisman and enraged by Darth Vader!  Then, over 135 years later, in the final chapter (Legacy Volume 6), Cade Skywalker's plan to assassinate Emperor Darth Krayt is aided by a \"secret weapon\" in the form of Celeste Morne -- the Jedi Knight of the Old Republic who is in possession of, and possibly possessed by, the powerful Muur Talisman. Cade and Celeste will change the galaxy -- for better, or for worse!  The epic Star Wars: Vector storyline spread over four thousand years of history and crossed over four comic-book series -- Rebellion, Knights of the Old Republic, Dark Times, and Legacy! </i><br/> <br/><u>Collects</u></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4050-18575\" href=\"/star-wars-legacy/4050-18575/\" slug=\"star-wars-legacy\">   Star Wars: Legacy</a> #28-31</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4050-18864\" href=\"/star-wars-rebellion/4050-18864/\" slug=\"star-wars-rebellion\">   Star Wars: Rebellion</a> #15-16</p>",

Grown in a lab from the finest genetic material, fifteen-year-old Luna has been trained since birth to be the U.S. government’s ultimate espionage weapon. Now she has been given an assignment that will test her abilities to the utmost—high school.</i></p><p><i>Posing as an ordinary student at an elite high school, Luna must keep her head down and her grades up while trying to uncover an evil plot. Luna’s training has left her completely unprepared to handle the stresses and strains of ordinary teenage relationships—making friends, battling rivals, and having her first big crush on bad boy Jonah, the son of her arch-nemesis, Count Von Brucken! Making matters worse, Luna’s fake father is the overly warm-and-fuzzy Dr. Andy and her so-called mother is the always businesslike, unemotional \"Control.\" Parental pressure combined with having to stay up late while spying are taking a toll on Luna, and it’s only a matter of time before she slips and blows her cover!</i></p>",

Magenta and her just-as-nasty (if not-so-bright) buddy Lucrezia take on more amorous adventures in this second volume. These two solve crime and detect mischief in ways Holmes and Watson NEVER imagined! With tongue firmly planted in cheek (and other areas of the body) <strong>Magenta - The Power of Pink</strong> enjoys the retro-charm of John Willie-style artwork with a distictively modern sense of humor. And nudity.</em></p>",

Picking up after the American Revolution, where Part I left off, Part II opens with the Enlightenment and rolls across Napoleon, the fall of the Ottoman Empire, World War I and II, and all the way to our recent imbroglios in Iraq and Afghanistan. <strong>The Cartoon History of the Modern World Part II </strong>is a monumental, one might say “historic” achievement, at once edifying, irreverent, and wildly entertaining. Terry Jones of Monty Python said of the first volume of this series, <strong>“</strong>Obviously one of the great books of all time.” And modern civilization’s most recent act is no less enthralling.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Now, together under one cover for the very first time, the complete 'Matchmakers' saga! The story caused quite a stir, as it brought back the 'new look' of Riverdale's fabled teens, first seen in the landmark Bad Boy Trouble, the epic 2007 tale that gave the flagship characters of Archie Comics an extreme and modern makeover! Add to that the intrigue of Jughead actually showing interest in a girl and you've got a recipe for a tale of combustible proportions! It all starts when Archie, Betty, Reggie, and Veronica agree that Jughead needs a break from his 'fifth wheel' status. They hatch a scheme to find a girl who will interest Jughead more than food and sleep - never realizing they would actually succeed! Or have they? Comic book legends Joe Staton and Al Milgrom bring their years of experience to the Archie 'new look,' handling pencils and inks respectively, and help you relive the most talked-about Jughead story of 2008 in this special collection!</em></p>",
