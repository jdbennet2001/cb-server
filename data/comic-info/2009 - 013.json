The Major Seven gave Gravel a puzzle to solve, how does one of the royalty of magic in England get killed in a place where she cannot possibly die? Gravel only knows one way to solve puzzles - by shooting them, and then shooting anyone who complains. He doesn't know another way to do business, and that might just see him dead. How does one man affect a group who are more numerous and more deadly? Well, that's pretty much what the SAS was invented for! This issue is available with a regular or wraparound cover by Mike Wolfer.</i>",
