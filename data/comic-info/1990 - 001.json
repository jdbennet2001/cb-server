            "description": "<p>The Phantom Stranger, John Constantine, Dr. Occult, and Mister E have gathered in a dimly lit room to discuss a young boy who has a natural power for magic. It is an uneasy gathering. Occult says they should help the boy channel his power for good, while E says they ought to kill him to prevent him from ever turning evil. Constantine doesn't really want anything to do with the situation. The Stranger, who appears to be somewhat in charge, says that they must only offer him a choice. Occult mentions that the Cold Flame, a group of evil magicians is also after the child. The Stranger manages to convince the others that it is up to the four of them to make sure that the boy chooses correctly.</p><p>While the four have been talking, a young boy has been skateboarding nearby. He hears a tapping that seems to be coming from every direction. He stops, turns around and is frightened to find Mister E directly behind him. E grimly asks him if he believes in magic; the boy takes off running. He goes down an alleyway, only to find Dr. Occult who tells him that they only want to talk. The boy(whose name we learn is Tim) skates away and nearly misses hitting the Phantom Stranger. Thinking that he's clear, he finally stops outside a magic shop to catch his breath, only to be grabbed by the cigarette-smoking John Constantine.</p><p>Constantine tells Tim that he and his friends aren't going to hurt him; they just want to talk. The three other mystics appear, and the Stranger re-asks E's question. \"Do you believe in magic?\" After Tim's sarcastic retort, the Stranger asks him a final time. Tim tells him that he used to when he was younger. He used to wish magic was real, but he grew out of it. The Stranger tells the lad that magic IS real, and the four introduce themselves. Tim learns that names have power, and he should never tell anyone his real name. Also, instead of asking someone's name, he should ask what they would like to be called. Tim looks at them in disbelief and and asks them if he's on a <i>Candid Camera</i>. Occult assures him that there is no camera, and that they want to offer Tim a choice. To prove that magic is real, Occult takes Tim's yo-yo and clasps it in his hands. He releases them and an owl flies out. Tim gasps and asks if he could learn to do that. The Stranger tells Tim that in time, he could. He tells Tim that they want to educate him; and asks Tim to go with him. Tim thinks to himself that if he could do stuff like that, nobody would ever mess with him again. He accepts the Stranger's offer, and the owl flies back down and lands on Tim's shoulder. The Phantom Stranger creates a door and the two walk through.</p><p>They enter total blackness. Tim expresses fear, but the Stranger tells him that nothing in the past can hurt him. Tim asks where they are; the Stranger informs him that they are not anyWHERE. They are in the void at the dawn of time. Tim hears a loud, painful noise that sounds like screaming. The Stranger says that the painful cry of birth... the birth of everything. A light appears in the distance. The Stranger describes it as the Silver City, and sadly says that he can go no further. Suddenly, a light shines down from the city. Tim describes it as looking \"like Star Wars\". The Stranger tells him that it is the result of the first war; the war in Heaven. The \"light\" is actually the falling angels. Six giants stand in a circle, each wearing a different colored robe. The Phantom Stranger tells Tim that they are the archangels. The Stranger then tells Tim that it is time to visit Earth. As they approach the Earth, the Stranger tells Tim that while it is true that the Earth was once a molten ball of lave, in another frame of reference it is true that the Earth was once a concave dish full of the pre-dead(demons).</p><p>The two walk through Earth's past, past the death of the dinosaurs, until they reach the destruction of Atlantis. The Stranger informs Tim that this isn't the true Atlantis, this was just the last archipelago. They approach a toothless old man sitting alone on a rock. The man surprises Tim by talking to him. Tim asks the man if he can see him, but the man responds that he can't see or hear him. Still, his spells told him that Tim would be there. As the man was saying, Atlantis doesn't have a \"quantifiable existence.\" There have been many Atlantises, and will be many more. Atlantis is a symbol of magic; the true Atlantis is inside everyone. It is our birthplace and our unattainable goal. Moving on to the subject of magic, the wizened old man tells Tim that basically it's a bunch of crap. Definitely not worth the price. He tells the Phantom Stranger to take Tim away, and advises Tim not to take the Trenchcoat Brigade's offer.</p><p>Tim and the Stranger continue their walk through the ages of magic. They see a prehistoric shaman, ancient Egypt, a Chinese sorceress, and representations of Greek rituals. Tim begins to feel sick, and the Phantom Stranger apologizes for moving so fast. They stop in Winchester, England, where they meet a teenaged boy. The teen introduces himself as Merlin. When Tim asks how Merlin can see them, he responds that he is the greatest wizard of his time due to his demon blood. He then goes into detail about his future life. Of how he'll Arthur become king, but will become infatuated by Nimue. Of how she'll betray him and seal him in cave to die. At least, Merlin points out, it will be interesting. A young boy enters and asks Merlin who he's talking to because he can't see anyone. Merlin introduces the boy as Iason, and tells him that of course he can't see anyone. Tim is puzzled and asks Merlin that if he knows the future is going to end so bad, why doesn't he try to change it. Merlin solemnly tells him he can't... \"magic grants no freedoms\". As the two leave, Tim asks the Stranger if he could be as powerful as Merlin. The Stranger tells him that while he isn't of demon blood, he could indeed be that powerful. Tim ponders the fact that Merlin's life wouldn't be worth the cost of magic, but he was going to do it anyway. He tells the Strange that wants to see more.</p><p>They walk through the Salem Witch Trials to show Tim that people kill what they fear. He explains to Tim about the differences between science and magic and how the two are rarely compatible. They continue walking. The Stranger show Tim Kent Nelson and the helmet of Nabu; and then asks Tim to take a seat. They appear to be in a theater of some sort, and a well-dressed with a top hat appears on-screen. The Phantom Stranger tells Tim that the man is Zatara; father of Zatanna, the famous stage magician. Zatara recites a poetic monologue about his life and pulls a bloody rabbit out of his hat. As the screen goes dark, Tim notices a man in a turban sitting next to him. The man begins speaking, and the Stranger tells Tim that the man is Sargon the Sorceror; a magician who gave his life to protect heaven. Sargon begins grotesquely melting and pointing his finger at Tim, he intones that, \"It's got a price. Nothing's free\". The Stranger grabs Sargon's ruby from the melted goo and asks Tim if he wants it. Tim doesn't know, and the Stranger tells him that makes sense.</p><p>The two walk through the exit, and the Stranger tells Tim that he has taken him as far as he can. The exit, and appear coming out of the magic shop's door. John Constantine tells Tim that he's going to be his next guide and asks Tim if he wants to bring his owl. Tim agrees, and the two begin walking. As Tim and Constantine head off into the distance, E grimly informs the others that he thinks they should still kill him.</p>",

            "description": "<p>A pair of NASA planes are brought down. Doctor Weltmann  oversees the installation of a Lazarus Pit, in Ra's Al Ghul's hidden lair, in the Amazon rainforest. Ra's Al Ghul receives a communique from Doctor Brant Carmody. The timetable is moved up on their scheme. Carmody's son, Brant, Jr., questions his father's mysterious behavior. Carmody assures his son that everything he is doing is to make the world a better place for Brant, Jr. Grind informs Ra's Al Ghul that his daughter, Talia, has requested an audience. After purposefully making Talia wait unnecessarily, Ra's Al Ghul allows his daughter into his presence. Talia declares her loyalty to her father.</p><p>To test Talia, Ra's Al Ghul orders Grind to send an assassin, Shard, to murder the Batman. Bruce Wayne, and Tim Drake, attend Carmody's lecture on climate change. Wayne, and Drake, mingle with Carmody, and others, afterwards. Drake befriends Brant, Jr. Unbeknownst to Wayne, he is being surreptitiously observed, from afar, by Talia. Spying the Bat-Signal in the sky, Wayne, and Drake, make their farewells. Wayne, as the Batman, responds to the Bat-Signal. The Batman meets with Police Comissioner James Gordon. The Batman is shown a corpse, with a bat pinned to it. The corpse's hand has been severed.</p><p>The Batman discerns where his unknown foe is summoning him to, from clues found on the corpse. The Batman storms the Aces Club. Shard ambushes Batman. After a pitched struggle, the Batman subdues Shard. Disguising himself as Shard, the Batman locates Shard's transport, and  takes it to meet Shard's master. Ra's Al Ghul makes contact with fading silver screen siren, Evelyn Grace. Ra's Al Ghul makes Grace an offer she can't refuse. Talia gets a message, from Ra's Al Ghul, to Carmody.  The Batman, as Shard, is brought to the hidden lair of Ra's Al Ghul. There, \"Shard\" witnesses Grace being restored to her youth, and beauty, by immersion in the Lazarus Pit.</p><p>Ra's Al Ghul takes Grace as his bride. The Batman, as Shard, does some investigating, to determine Ra's Al Ghul's scheme. Ultimately, \"Shard' is discovered, and revealed to be the Batman. The Batman escapes Ra's Al Ghul's headquarters. Due to their discovery, Ra's Al Ghul moves his base of operations. Ra's Al Ghul consummates his marriage to Grace. Talia comes to collect Carmody. A fire fight breaks out between Talia's forces, and Carmody's security attachment. The Batman intervenes, but not in time to save Brant, Jr, who is hit by stray gunfire. The Batman subdues Talia. The Batman makes off with Carmody, Brant Jr., and Talia.</p><p>The Batman returns to the Batcave, to get Brant, Jr. medical aid. Ra's Al Ghul's forces storm the Batcave. Ra's Al Ghul offers to use the Lazarus Pit to restore Brant, Jr. Carmody attacks the Batman. Ra's Al Ghul breaches the Batcave's defenses. Batman goes on the offensive. Against the Batman's wishes, Drake involves himself in the conflict. Drake is taken hostage by Grind. The Batman is rendered unconscious. Talia retrieves Carmody from the Batman's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Ra's Al Ghul takes the Batman prisoner. Drake, and Pennyworth, are allowed to live. Grace reaches out to Talia, to try to forge a bond with her new daughter.</p><p>Brant, Jr. is placed In the Lazarus Pit, but all does not go well. The Batman is brought before Ra's Al Ghul, and given a choice... join Ra's Al Ghul or die. The Batman discerns where Ra's Al Ghul's new base of operations is located. Ra's Al Ghul reveals his plan to save the Earth, a plan that will also cost the lives of millions of human beings. The Batman refuses to join with Ra's Al Ghul. The Batman is carried off to his execution. Talia tries to save the Batman, only to be stopped by Grace. The Batman escapes Ra's Al Ghul's deathtrap. The Batman commandeers one of Ra's Al Ghul's aircraft, and crashes it into Ra's Al Ghul's Antarctic base.</p><p>Grace gets the drop on the Batman. Talia subdues Grace. Ra's Al Ghul attacks the Batman. Carmody prevents Grind from assassinating the Batman. Carmody kills Grind, but suffers a mortal wound in the process, Carmody races to the Lazarus Pit. Carmody falls into the Lazarus Pit, and dies. Brant, Jr. emerges from the Lazarus Pit, restored. The Batman escapes with Brant, Jr, Grace and Talia. Ra's Al Ghul is seemingly slain when a massive explosion consumes his Antarctic fortress. The Batman does not wish to discuss Talia's miscarriage, a tragic occurrence from their previous encounter. The Batman returns to the Batcave. Grace reveals, to Talia, that she is pregnant with Ra's Al Ghul's child.</p>",

The Penguin mails his confession tape to Police Commissioner James Gordon. The Batman's investigation into the escape of four members of his rogues' gallery, leads him to the Gotham Museum of Antiquities. The Batman walks right into the Riddler's trap. The Batman escapes the Riddler's deathtrap. The Riddler leaves behind three riddles, alluding to the whereabouts of the other escaped criminals. Following the Riddler's clues leads the Batman to Two-Face. The Batman is taken captive, and placed in another deathtrap.</p><p>The Batman escapes Two-Face's deathtrap. Returning to the scene of Twine's murder, the Batman re-encounters the Riddler. The Riddler is astonished to discover the Batman waiting for him, and that Twine has already been murdered. The Batman beats the Riddler into unconsciousness. Gordon interrogates the Riddler, to no avail. The Batman leaks the Riddler's false confession to the Gotham Gazette, enraging the Penguin. The Penguin sends another tape to Gordon, demanding the Riddler recount the details of Twine's murder. The Joker breaks the Riddler out of police custody.</p><p>The Joker sets about murdering the Riddler in a very slow fashion. Two-Face confronts the Joker. Following the Riddler's clues leads the Batman to the Joker. The Batman confronts the Joker, and Two-Face. Two-Face's bodyguards occupy the Batman long enough for Two-Face, and the Joker, to escape. The Batman subdues Two-Face's bodyguards, and saves the Riddler's life. The Batman tracks down the Joker. The Batman subdues the Joker. Following the Riddler's clues leads the Batman to the Penguin. The Batman finds Two-Face confronting the Penguin.</p><p>The Batman, and Two-Face, fall prey to the same hallucinogenic toxin the Penguin used to murder Twine. The Batman fights through his hallucinations, and takes the Penguin down. The Batman learns that the Penguin orchestrated the contest of villains to make sure that Twine would be murdered, due to an old grudge the Penguin held against Twine.</p><h3><ins>Pin-Up Gallery</ins></h3><p>Illustrations of the Batman, his allies and enemies, by the top artists of the day.</p><h3><ins>\"The Robot Robbers!'</ins></h3><p>This story was original published in<a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman-42-claws-of-the-catwoman/4000-122711/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-122711\"> Batman #42</a> (August-September, 1947).
