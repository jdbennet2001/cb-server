            "description": "<p>Flashback to a few months earlier. \"Uncle Ben\" from another reality just shot and killed Spider-Man from the year 2211. This is witnessed by a kid drinking beer behind a tombstone. He takes the helmut off of the body before it disappears and leaves a burnt body outline in the grass.</p><p>In a Manhattan precinct, it seems that a couple of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Jamie Madrox and Agent Sands are questioning the officer that arrested Floyd Baker for the murder of a John Doe. He identifies the John Doe from a picture of Peter Parker, Aunt May, and Uncle Ben. He mentions how they managed to get him to confess even though they didn't have any hard evidence. This enrages Agent Sands who turns out to actually be Sandman, son of Floyd Baker. As Madrox tries to stop him from harming the officer, it turns out that Spider-Man's image inducer needs to be recharged. Reenforcements arrive so Sandman busts a hole through the wall to allow them to escape.</p><p>Meanwhile Betty Brant and Flash Thompson are having dinner at a fancy restaurant. Flash is trying to reconnect on the good things from his life before his accident. Betty asks Flash about Miss Arrow, the school nurse. She thinks Arrow may have a thing for Flash. Flash doesn't think so. Betty excuses herself to use the restroom. As she sits on the toilet, a bunch of spiders crawl out and all over her. Betty bolts out of the restroom. As a manager and Flash go back in with her, all the spiders are gone. The manager finds some cocaine and assumes it's Betty's. He asks her to leave before he presses charges against her. Hiding in a stall, Miss Arrow looks on with a smile on her face.</p><p>Spider-Man and Sandman decide to go to the cemetary to see if Uncle Ben is still buried there. At Ben's gravesite, Spider-Man's spider sense goes off. He tells Sandman that it's not necessarily because of something bad, rather he senses something important. They spot a van parked outside the cemetary. Inside is the young man that took the helmut of Spider-Man from 2211. He tells them how he got it. Spider-Man puts the helmut on and it recognizes his DNA and turns on. Spider-Man asks it to show the last visual recordings from the previous wearer. Spider-Man sees Uncle Ben standing over the body with a gun in his hand. He then asks the helmut if he is still alive. Scanning a two hundred mile radius, it locates him and asks if he wants to be lead to him.</p>",

Captain Britain must take on his opposite for a battle that will be waged upon many worlds.</em></p><p>This issue provides the back story for Albion, Excalibur's latest enemy.</p><p>At the opening of the issue, Excalibur is standing around a hologram of Albion trying to figure out who he is and where he came from. The scene switches to Albion and Lionheart sparring and at the end, he tells her his history.</p><p>On another Earth, Albion was a ranger in a centuries long war that spanned the globe. When he died in battle, Merlyn and Roma came to him and offered him the choice between an amulet and a sword. Unlike 616 Captain Britain, Albion chose the sword, the tool of destruction. Roma tried to take back the sword since he wasn't supposed to have taken it, but Merlyn stopped her and they left. Albion, now empowered, destroyed all his enemies on the battlefield and eventually got around to killing his enemies all over the world, ending the war entirely. Unfortunately, the long war had ravaged his world and people were starving and dying of diseases, enemies that Albion could not fight. Instead, he found another enemy, a man named Warlord who had apparent been the cause of the war. He discovered Warlord when the man was asking pan-dimensional traders (who had already given him tremendous power) for some more tools to take over the world. While the traders tried to escape, another Captain Britain arrived and stopped them. He didn't get there fast enough though, and Albion killed Warlord even after he surrendered. The Captain and Albion fought and Albion won. With the Captain and the traders at his mercy, he made them tell him all about the Captain Britain Corps. They tell him and Albion, still mad at Roma for trying to take his sword away all those years before, killed the Captain and vowed to kill all the other Captain Britains.</p><p>Back in the present, Albion and Lionheart meet and ally with Scicluna and the evil X-Men from earlier in the series.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i> </i><i>Overview: <br /></i></p> <p>With Mutant Town under siege and the X-Cell having taken refuge there, X-Factor races both the clock and their own divided allegiances as they try to stave off the very real possibility of every former mutant being rounded up and imprisoned as a potential terrorist. But will they have to reveal their knowledge of M-Day's secret...and, if so, what will the fallout be? <br /><br /><b> </b><b>Issue Summary:</b> <br /><br /><i>Trust. That’s what relationships come down to. Heck, that’s what living day-to-day comes down to… in hundreds of little ways. You trust people aren’t going to run red lights and hit you in the crosswalk. You trust that people in authority aren’t going to abuse that authority. And sometimes, it’s as simple as that you trust someone to be able to do what they can say. </i></p> <p>Sitting in Quicksilver’s living room, young Elijah Cross tells his host that he used to be amazing. He could make his body super heavy… but still be able to move. So if he ran into people, he’d hit like a ton of bricks. They’d never see it coming. The number of norms who figured he was easy picking that he annihilated…  </p><p>He can imagine, Quicksilver interrupts lazily. And the government just took it all away, the incensed Elijah continues, not noticing his host’s disinterest. They figured they were threats. When Pietro musingly asks him if he’s certain it was the government, Elijah replies “Of course!” After everything that’s happened since, how can there be <i>any</i> doubt? M-Day was step one, and the Registration Act was step two. And his people and he aren’t going to stand around waiting to find out what they’ve got up their sleeves next. They have to do something. Somebody’s got to.  </p><p>Thus X-Cell, Pietro concludes. When his guest confirms, Pietro remarks that he can’t help but observe that the government isn’t cooperating, considering they’re under siege. That’s why he came looking for him, he tells Pietro. He’s let the others know. They’re hiding out there in mutant town… but they’ll make their way there. Word on the street is… he can help people. The word is true, Pietro replies, provided he’s worthy. “Is he?” he then asks, outstretching his hand. Holding out his own in acceptance, Elijah replies, “Hell yes.”  </p><p>“Hell no,” a voice then adds, her hand grabbing Pietro’s wrist in interception. In a quick motion, the owner of that wrist, Callisto, twists the Pietro’s arm, as well as the other, behind Pietro’s back, using leverage to hold him in place. Elijah is ecstatic at seeing Callisto, calling her “Cally,” but the woman tells him to shut up.  </p><p>Still calm despite his predicament, Pietro suggests to Callisto that she let him go. To this, Calliso rejoins that she suggests he get ready to get his butt handed to him… Suddenly, Callisto is interrupted as another Pietro appear to her side and delivers a surprise left cross across her chin, followed by a right cross. She quickly looses balance and collapses to the floor.  </p><p>Dumbfounded by what just happened, as well as the disappearance of one of the Pietros, Elijah asks what just happened. How did he <i>do</i> that? Replying that it’s complicated, Pietro suggests he simply accept it. Now turning his attention to Callisto, he then asks if she’s blaming <i>him</i> for her own shortcoming. Taken aback at this, Callisto wipes blood from her chin and looks up with abject contempt at Pietro. She tells him that after he “helped” her, she was in <i>agony</i>! Her skin was hypersensitive! The rain touched her and she thought she was going to die! Swearing, she says that death would have been a <i>blessing</i>! How is that her shortcomings?  </p><p>With a smirk, Pietro crosses his arms and looks down at Callisto, still on the floor. On the surface of it, he begins, she was judged <i>unworthy</i>. Still… he supposes it’s possible that she was the unfortunate victim of a sort of… learning curve… that he is experiencing. If that is the case, her… mishap… is <i>regrettable</i>. Trying to help Callisto up, Elijah asks what “learning curve?” Can he help his people or not?  </p><p>Replying that he can, Pietro adds that he has given the matter much thought and he believes that, in order to ensure the process is more… refined… he needs a vessel. His power <i>can</i> be overwhelming. He requires someone who can serve as a… catalyst, if you will. He siphons his power into him, and he into those whom he wishes to help… and thus will the energies be safer for the recipient. When Elijah then asks where this “catalyst” is supposed to come from, Pietro grins slightly. He tells the youth to trust him. He has someone in mind.  </p><p>Running his fingers through his hair as he leans over his cup of coffee, Rictor says “All right, all right, I’ll tell you what you want to know.” The man on the other side of the table, flanked by his fellow FBI agents, is pleased. Telling Rictor that that’s more like it, he adds that he’s making the right move, deciding to cooperate with the government. Now… tell him about his contacts with the X-Cell.  </p><p>He’s only seen the one guy, Rictor replies. When the interrogator asks him to describe him, Rictor does so. Kind of a squarish head… long nose… wide, crazy eyes… yellowish skin. Considering this, the interrogator postulates that the man in question could be jaundice. Probably a drug addict. Probably, Rictor confirms. When the man then asks his name, Rictor replies “Robert,” he thinks. Something like that. Then asked where they can find him, Rictor replies that all he knows is that he lives under the sea. In a pineapple. Interesting, the interrogator mumbles as he writes down the details he has been given.  </p><p>Entering the interrogation chamber with Val Cooper, Madrox asks how they are treating him. Addressing the interrogator as Agent Flynn, Val informs him that the suspect is being released to Mr. Madrox. Incredulous, Agent Flynn informs her that they’re just starting to make progress. Assuring him that she believes him, she adds that they need Mr. Madrox’s cooperation, and he needs his team. So Mr. Rictor is sprung for now, along with Ms. Sinclair.  </p><p>As the two begin to leave, Val tells them that Agent Cody will escort them to where Rahn’e already waiting for them. She then tells Madrox specifically that he’d better not screw this up. When he asks back when has he ever, Val tells him not to get her started.             </p><p>Once they have left, Val turns to Agent Flynn, asking him what they have. His contact, Flynn tells her, is named “Robert” and he claims to live in a pineapple under the sea. He’s figuring that’s code for a secret aquatic base. Before Flynn can go further, Val grabs the sheet of paper from Flynn’s pad and rips it off. Crumbling it up, she asks if he has any children. When Flynn replies that he doesn’t, him being married to his work, Val replies that he should feel free to make it an open marriage. As she then leaves, Val fumes. Now she’s going to have that stupid song in her head all day.             </p><p>Cowering in the arms of Monet, who is flying high above New York City, Nicole pleads for her not to drop her. Annoyed, Monet asks the young girl to trust her, to which Nicole replies that she could fall. To this, Monet replies that that’s not going to happen, the girl asks how does she know. Her powers vanished without warning. How does she know hers won’t too, and they’ll both fall to their deaths? Considering this for a moment, Monet eventually tells Nicole that it’s quiet time now.             </p><p>Something suddenly catching her eye, Monet asks Siryn if she sees it too. Flying nearby, Theresa replies that it’s kind of hard to miss. The source of their amazement is a barbwire-tipped fence, which surrounds Mutant Town. Dumbfounded, Monet asks Siryn if she thinks all of this is for them. She means, just because they broke out of a French jail and took a citizen with them… And she crucified a guy, Theresa reminds her. Don’t forget that. Yes, well… Monet begins. She was feeling <i>hormonal</i>.  </p><p>Changing subjects, Monet asks Siryn to go back to gliding, as her shrieking is attracting too much attention. When Siryn replies that she can’t help her powers, Nicole replies that she should be happy she <i>has</i> powers.  </p><p>Now changing subject herself, once they have landed on a roof, Siryn looks over the side to the street below, declaring it looks like they have company. Correction, she then says. Had company. They’re pulling out. When Monet asks “I.N.S.?” Siryn replies, “A.R.M.Y.” Something tells her that whatever’s going on, it has nothing to do with them. Asked by Monet if she has any clue what it could be, Siryn quips that she works for a <i>detective</i> agency. How should she know about <i>clues</i>?  </p><p>Inside X-Factor HQ, Layla removes the darts from the dartboard, asking how should <i>she</i> know who they are or where they are? Not convinced, Madrox tells her not to screw around. Val Cooper sure wasn’t. If they don’t want Mutant Town turned into a parking lot, they’ve got to find these terrorists. Having moved back to the line drawn on the floor, Layla moves to toss another dark at the board. As she dose so, she explains that they’re not terrorists. They’re scared people. And if he wants the truth, they don’t have to do anything. It’ll take care of itself.  </p><p>Confused, Madrox asks back what she means by that, to which Layla replies just that. She explains that they did this stuffy of people who were sick and took cough medicine and compared them to people who didn’t. So, she continues, still tossing darts, they found out that people who didn’t take the medicine got well just as fast as those who did. The medicine didn’t really make a difference. And splinters. People pick at splinters to get them out, but eventually they body just pushes ‘em out on its own. These guys will self-destruct all on their own without X-Factor’s help. Trust her, she says, tossing her fifth bulls-eye at the dart board. She’s Layla Miller. She knows stuff.  </p><p>Entering the common area, Monet greets the group, telling them that they’re back. She then adds that they brought a French refugee ex-mutant with them. In punctuation to this, Nicole offers a timid <i>bonjour</i>. Half a moment later, Layla’s sixth dart bounces off the board, followed by a stunned Layla starring at Nicole in confused horror. Bringing the two together, Theresa introduces Nicole personally and tells Layla that she’s going to room with her, if that’s okay. When Layla can only offer another <i>What?</i> Theresa tells her that she needed their help. <i>What?</i> Layla says again, only more emphatically.  </p><p>Picking up on the subtext, Rictor is greatly amused. She didn’t see this coming! Oh, man, this is beautiful! Hardly amused herself, Rahne sarcastically agrees, asking if they could get back to the main topic. Agreeing, Madrox tells the group that, if Layla’s not going to help them, then they go door-to-door if they have to…  </p><p>Interrupting, Monet asks what the Hell is going on. Succinctly, Rahne does so: A group of former mutant think the government was responsible for M-Day. They’ve formed a terrorist group called the X-Cell and they’re hiding out in Mutant Town. Incredulous at this, Monet asks if they’re just supposed to turn them over, to which Madrox confirms. <i>Bugger that!</i> Monet offers in response.        </p><p>Madrox tries to reply but is unable, as Monet continues. Calling this absurd, she asks why should this “X-Cell” be punished? Why can’t they just tell them what <i>really</i> happened? Hearing this, a surprised and interested Nicole asks Monet what really <i>what</i> really did happen. Silence from everyone present is her only response. Breaking the lull, Madrox tells Monet to look – if they don’t find them peacefully, then the feds will find them forcefully. Nobody needs that. He gets what she’s saying, but first things first.  </p><p>Appearing at his side, Layla provides Madrox with a slip of paper and a simple declaration of “here.” When he begins to ask a question, she reiterates. She said “here.” Proceeding to hand two other slips of paper out, one to Guido and one to Theresa, Layla reminds them what she told them. They don’t have to do anything, but they don’t <i>trust</i> her, so fine. They wanted places to go, so go. Now. Move. As the group departs, Nicole sheepishly asks if she’s in trouble. Hands on her hips, Layla replies that she hasn’t decided.  </p><p>A short time later, Madrox and Rictor burst through a door of a deli, the former shouting “Freeze!” Hardly surprised, the shop owner asks, “Pick up for Miller?” When the two seem confused at this, the shop owner reaches for a tray of sandwiches and asks if they are from X-Factor. Receiving a “yes,” he presents the tray, explaining, Layla Miller, X-Factor Investigations. She ordered this. She said they’d be by. Here they go. Eying the tray with distain, Rictor mutters he’ll kill her. Madrox, however, in contrast grins and exclaims “Ooo! Pastrami.”  </p><p>Elsewhere, Monet and Siryn stand by a lamp post, watching cards go by. After a while of silence, Monet asks Theresa about the piece of paper Layla gave here. Did it tell her just how <i>long</i> they’re supposed to stand at this street corner? Receiving a “no,” Monet mutters <i>terrific</i>.            </p><p>Suddenly, the lull in action breaks, as a car pulls up. the occupant calls out to the two and asks them how much for the <i>both</i> of them <i>together</i>. In response, Monet grits her teeth and uses her strength to squeeze the lamp post until it is bent. Exclaiming his change of interest, the driver races off, tires squealing. Watching the car depart, Monet asks Theresa to remind her to kill Layla. To this, Theresa replies not if she gets to her first.  </p><p>Still elsewhere, Guido removes the lip to a manhole and peers down. Yeah, okay, he offers. <i>This</i> ain’t <i>happening</i>. Flanking Giudo, Rahne covers her mouth with her fist, Rahne remarks at the stench. She canna stomach it… Both agreeing that neither of them are going down, Guido replaces the cover and wonders <i>now</i> what? If they’re not going what Layla said to on the note…           </p><p>Considering this, Rahne replies that they both were doing just fine before Layla came along. They’re not without their own resources. In fact, she has an idea. Told to follow her, Guido asks where they’re going. Back to the alley, she explains, where Rictor and she first ran into the feds. Asked by Guido what they’re going to do there, Rahne transforms into her lupine form and replies, “What I do best.”  </p><p>As Madrox carries to tray of sandwiches back to the HQ, Rictor proclaims that he can’t believe he’s being Layla’s delivery boy. Doesn’t he have any pride at all? To this, Madro replies that he’s sure she’sgot a reason for all this… Man, Rictor interrupts. What’s it take for him to know when he’s being…  </p><p>Madrox and Rictor’s conversation is interrupted by a voice in the alley, who calls out to them. Stopping, Madrox asks the man, a large individual, covering his appearance with a large hat and long coat, if he’s referring to him. Ignoring the actual question, the man tells Madrox to give him some of that food. Taking note of the mass of flab from behind the man’s coat, Rictor rejoins that, if he asks him, he could stand to lose a few pounds. Nobody <i>asked</i> him, the man replies, calling Rictor a “tamale tosser.”  </p><p>As Rictor’s anger quickly rises at the ethnic slur, Madrox tries to calm him down. However, as the two begin to argue, the man pushes Rictor aside with one hand, while using the other to grab the tray from Madrox. Likewise pushed back, Madrox impacts against the wall, immediately producing a dupe. Seeing this, the man in question recognizes Madrox, saying his name. In turn, Madrox recognizes the man. <i>Blob!</i> Hardly the same as his former self, the Blob is still overweight, yet not lacks the stature and girth he once did. Now, his mass is reduced to a mass of skin that hangs off of him like an over-sized shirt. No longer is he a man of imposing mass, but a shell of his former self.        </p><p>In horror at being recognized, the Blob instructs the two to keep back. He just… he was hungry! Still irate, Rictor mocks his hunger by offering a “knuckle sandwich” and delivers a left cross to the Blob’s chin, launching him backwards. More in disgust at the joke than the action, the new Madrox dupe mocks Rictor’s “knuckle sandwich” quip. Already having taken the Blob by his coat’s lapels, Rictor remarks back that it was a tough-guy joke, to which the dupe rejoins that it could work for Bogie, but not him.  </p><p>Having had enough, Rictor instructs Madrox to get that dupe out of his face, and then turns his attention back to the Blob, pushing him up against the wall. Snarling as he does so, Rictor tells the Blob to admit that he’s one of the X-Cell, isn’t he? When the Blob replies that he never heard of them, Rictor pushed him against the wall again. <i>Wrong answer!</i> Calling out Rictor, Madrox tells him to go easy on him. Can’t he see he’s helpless? Neither of them have any powers, Rictor reminds Madrox. But <i>one</i> of them is being a man about it.  </p><p>Now in tears, the former Blob pleads to be let do. It’s like he said. He ain’t no threat! He… He just… Finally releasing the Blob, who slides against the wall until he’s sitting on the alley ground, Rictor mocks him. Figures, he says. He’s blubbering. Gotta admire the consistency. A moment later, however, Rictor is surprised, as the Blob launches himself and his right fist, knocking Rictor in the groin and doubling him over.  </p><p>As Madrox race to action, bridging the gap between himself and the Blob, a new party enters the alley from above. As she lands atop Madrox, knocking him down and creating a new dupe in the process, the costumed female chastises the Blob, calling him by his surname of “Dukes,” and reminding him that he was supposed to keep a low profile. When the Blob replies that he was hungry, she proclaims “God Almighty.”  </p><p>Though knocked down, Madrox’s mind and memory race. He recognizes the woman. Fatale! An Assassin who used to be part of a group called the Dark Descendants, Depowered, but still a threat. In her own moment of recognition, she calls Madrox by his codename. “Multiple Man!” to which he asks what tipped her off. The new dupe, however, calls Fatale “my child” and proceeds to inform her that violence is not to be found on the path of enlightenment…  </p><p>Moving back into attack mode, Fatale launches a fist at the dupe, who side-steps it with ease. The dupe then tells her assailant that he sees she needs persuasion to follow the path. Very well. Trust him when he tells her that he loves her. Sometimes, however… love hurts. In demonstration, the dupe grabs Fatale’s arm and brings his own below down on hers, causing enough pain to produce an ear-curdling scream.  </p><p>Even from several feet away, Madrox hears the arm break. He notes that his dupe’s so calm about it… dispassionate. What part of him is that? He doesn’t know whether to take pride I it or be freaked out by it. Later, he will note that Fatale was howling so loudly about the pain that it drowned out the sound of the blade snapping out of her gauntlet. As a result, neither of them heard it until it was too late.  </p><p>Still, as Fatale attacks with her suddenly produced weapon, the dupe moves quickly and avoids a deep wound. However, the superficial cut is more than enough… when your dealing with a poisoned blade.  </p><p>Having won the reprieve, Fatale exits the alley, holding her broken arm. At the curb, she is greeted by the Blob, who is in the driver’s seat of a car. Asked where he got it, he quips to Fatale that he bought it on layaway. Where the Hell does she <i>think</i>? Now get in! Don’t make him ask twice. Getting him, she reminds Dukes that he did ask twice, to which he offers a disgusted “whatever!” As the car races off, Madrox, his dupe and Rictor can only watch.  </p><p>A few moments later, the car passes by the lamppost at which Monet and Siryn are posted. Seeing the occupants, both take to the air in pursuit, an action that does not go unnoticed by Fatale. However, even as she produces a rifle she is only able to aim with her one good arm, the now racing auto drives over a manhole, whose cover has not been properly affixed back over the hole. The result is a flipped car, which launches Fatale into the air and into the pavement a good distance away.     </p><p>Hot in pursuit, Monet and Theresa land at the site of the wreck. However, before either can take action, a sharp blade is thrown into the asphalt at Siryn’s foot. Looking up, Theresa sees Marrow, already having two more blades at the ready to throw. Greeting both females, she tells them it’s been a long time. Not long enough, <i>Marrow</i>, comes the cold reply. <br /></p>",

But when SHE-HULK finally uncovers what IRON MAN did to her cousin, she's going to do more than just break ranks...</i> <i>She's going to break every bone in his body! SHE-HULK'S most action-packed arc comes to a shattering conclusion! It's a battle for the ages! And one that will have terrible repercussions for Jen Walters, THE INITIATIVE, and THE INCREDIBLE HULK!</i></p><p><i>This issue takes place right before Incredible Hulk #106</i></p><p>She-Hulk # 18 concludes the \"Planet Without a Hulk\" storyline and with it, Jen Walters finally confronts Iron Man for his involvement in her cousin's disappearance!</p><p>As an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D and a registered super-hero, Jen Walters serves under Tony Stark, but his actions against the Hulk have made her mad. And like any other green blooded Hulk family member (okay, the only other green blooded Hulk family member) you do not want to see her angry. She can be hard to handle when she's green.</p><p>Writer Dan Slott, artist Rick Burchett, and cover artist Greg Horn bring you the undercard match of the year. Jen \"the Savage She-Hulk\" Walters vs. Tony \"the Invincible Iron Man\" Stark! And hey, if She-Hulk can't take Iron Man down, her cousin is up next!</p><p>Unfortunately for Iron Man and the rest of the Illuminati, the Hulk isn't as far away as they would like. As a matter of fact…he's very close to home. Pick up She-Hulk # 18, as the Marvel Universe moves one step closer to the Hulk's return. Retailers are advised to check their orders on this issue as it directly ties in to the upcoming World War Hulk event.</p><p>On the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, the Hulkbusters get word that a large gamma signature has been detected in New Mexico, the Hulk's old stomping grounds. The team has all assembled except for She-Hulk, who is not responding to the page. Clay Quartermain contacts Jen in her hover-car but she cuts off the transmission. She's tired of chasing after false leads. She has the head of the Nick Fury L.M.D. next to her. It's still busted and talking in a loop. She wishes she could think of a way to access its memory. She thinks about all of her friends that she could go to like Reed Richards, Hank Pym, etc. but she's not sure who she can trust now. Normally she'd go straight to Tony Stark but not now that he's in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. She finally decides to go her lawfirm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg, and Holliway. It's there that Mr. Zix says he can access its data.</p><p>She-Hulk sees a video of \"Nick Fury\" meeting with Bruce Banner. She finds out that the L.M.D. sent Hulk out on a space mission to \"smash\" something. They are unable to find out what happens next because the information is in a nested file. At the same time in a coffee shop across town, someone is using a laptop and mentions that \"they've found the encrypted file...\" On the laptop the screen says, \"Operation: Greener Pastures, S.H.I.E.L.D. File 93.56.7.\"</p><p>In New Mexico, the Hulkbusters arrive at one of the Hulk's old hideouts. They make their way inside and find the Leader inside. He is upset at being discovered. He mentions faking his death twice to carry out his secret master plan. He says he was just three days from releasing death spores. He gets in a giant robot and they prepare to fight.</p><p>Zix tells Jen that he can't access any more files. Suddenly, a new file comes up. Back in the coffee shop, Mastermind Excello is seen with his coyote pup. He accessed the file for them. Jen sees another video with Tony Stark, Reed Richards, Black Bolt, and Dr. Strange talking to Hulk on a video monitor. They tell him that they decided to send him off planet when they found out about \"Nick Fury's\" mission. They say he has threaten the planet too many times with his anger-induced destruction. Seeing this, Jen is no longer a happy camper.</p><p>The Hulkbusters suffer some injuries but they manage to take down the Leader. As they head back to the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, Clay's transmission is garbled. Those onboard the helicarrier think they are bringing in the Hulk and begin to celebrate. She-Hulk is also on her way to the helicarrier. Tony Stark is brought on deck and sees a huge banner saying \"Mission Accomplished.\" He starts to talk to the agents that there's been a mistake (since he knows Hulk is not on planet). Jen arrives with a rough landing. She immediately confronts Iron Man. When he asks her what her problem is, she says her problem isn't on Earth and that he's known that from day one. Before she can say anything else, he hits her with a full-powered blast from his repulsors. He orders some agents to lock her in the brig and that she is NOT to talk to anyone. As he turns his back, She-Hulk has already regained consciousness. Stark orders her not to say another word. She easily dodges his attacks. She starts knocking him around and shrugging off his attacks. She calls him a \"tin-plated tyrant\" and says he's been acting more like Dr. Doom. She tells him he's an idiot. Sending Bruce into space isn't going to solve anything. Iron Man says he knows that he'll probably come back. He tells her that they've been preparing for his return. A little needle pops out of his finger and he pokes Jen in the neck. He tells her it's an Adamantium needle with nanites from Project: Achilles.</p><p>When Jen wakes up, she immediately tries punching Iron Man only to feel pain in her fist. She has reverted back to her human form. Iron Man is showing her the results of Project: Achilles. She sees the Abomination, Ironclad, and Vector, all in human form. Stark tells her that they've perfected a way to stop Hulk-level threats, permanently. She-Hulk is no more. Jen tells him that he's mistaken if he thinks the threat from her has been neutralized. She-Hulk may be gone but she is still Jennifer Walters, one of the best lawyers on the East Coast. She says she is going to destroy him.</p><p><em>continued in Incredible Hulk #106</em></p>",

Real Supergirl says that maybe Kara got split off from her in one of many various ways, but Kara is a blight, and not at all what a real Supergirl would be like. She asks that Kara step aside, so Real Supergirl can make things right. Kara agrees, and is absorbed by Real Supergirl. But then Real Supergirl shatters, revealing Kara underneath. She realizes that she has had mind games played on her, and confronts the shatters of Real Supergirl, who is revealed to be Dark Angel, who has been testing her. They fight, but Dark Angel is stopped by a Monitor. He reassigns Dark Angel, and tells Kara the stuff she was seeing on Earth was part of a test of individuals who were supposed to have died in the crisis, but lived. These anomalies were tested in order to ensure their veracity in this world. But he also tells her the memories of her journey to Earth is fact.

            "description": "<p><em>A new story arc begins as Ms. Marvel drafts two recruits from the Initiative…Machine Man and Sleepwalker?! When Araña is kidnapped, it's time for Carol Danvers to use her newly expanded strike force to squash an evil that's hit too close to home! The ongoing team of writer Brian Reed and artist Aaron Lopresti kicks off the three-part \"Puppets\" with a last-page reveal that'll have fans of female heroes buzzing!</em></p><p>At the Raft prison for Superhumans, an army arrives with a mission to liberate a priosoner. A hand is seen moving toy models of the soldiers and is also giving out the orders. The soldiers work their way down and set an explosive to open a door to a cell. They are distracted by the arrival of S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers and the bomb blows up in their face. The man controlling the figures is outraged that things didn't go according to his plan.</p><p>At the Xavier Institute, Ms. Marvel is talking to Beast. He's surprised that she has the guts to show up there after her recent fight with Rogue. She wants to know more about the scan he did on her recently. An anomaly showed up on only his scan. She's had herself checked out several times since without those same results. She also admits (even though it's hard for her) that she's been hearing voices. He does another scan but says there isn't anything out of the ordinary. He will check out the scanner to make sure it's operating at one hundred percent. Before she leaves, he tells her that he was upset with her over her fight with Rogue but can't seem to be able to stay mad at her.</p><p>In Brooklyn, Araña is venting some steam by taking down some liquor store robbers. She is mad at Carol and bored out of her mind over her training classes. She arrives home to find her father home a day early. He says he came home early to see what she was up to. He is unhappy that she was out swinging so soon after getting out of the hospital. He begins to attack Carol for almost getting her killed. Anya quickly comes to her defense saying that it was the Doomsday Man that almost killed her and that Carol saved her life. She says it's time he let her grow up and swings off the roof.</p><p>The next day, Carol tries calling her boyfriend William as she fights a criminal by the name of Battleaxe. She knocks out Battleaxe as the same looking army of soldiers from the raft shoot an electrified net around her. Ms. Marvel knows they aren't S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers and asks who they are. They answer by shooting a grenade at her. More surprised than hurt, she soon recovers and takes out the soldiers. Picking one up, she is surprised to see a blank look in their eyes. She receives a call from on of her Lightning Storm S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Agent Sum, that the super-powered soldiers she asked for have been sent over by Maria Hill.</p><p>On the minicarrier, Ms. Marvel meets her two new recruits, Machine Man and Sleepwalker. Machine Man, or Aaron as he prefers to be called, is pretty much just rude. She soon finds herself surprised to be arguing with a robot. Things don't get any better when Rick Sheridan tells her that he's not Sleepwalker. Sleepwalker is the alien from the Mindscape dimension that lives in his head and only comes out when he's sleeping.</p><p>At the Daily Bugle, Ms. Marvel's PR agent is having words with J. Jonah Jameson over the headline and photo of Carol and Wonder Man on the front page. She is concerned over the headlines that Carol was busy kissing Wonder Man while police officers were being killed. Jameson asks if she's going to bring in her lawyers and throws in her face the fact that Ms. Marvel aided and abetted a felon, Julia Carpenter.</p><p>Gil Corazon, Anya's father, calls the S.H.I.E.L.D. contact number he has because Anya never came home last night. She hasn't been at school either. The agent on the phone asks him if Anya's friends with Caasandra Lang, Cassie St. Commons, or if she's taking and instructions from Ms. Greer Grant. Gil says not that he knows of. On the agent's computer, all of them are listed as \"missing.\" Anya is added to the list.</p><p>On the minicarrier, Ms. Marvel is with the agent working as the warden at the Raft. They are discussing the soldiers that have been captured along with Battleaxe. Machine Man arrives and asks why she has Chilean Army soldiers in custody. The warden confirms that these type of soldiers tried breaking out a criminal known as Exterminatrix. She soon orders her team to prepare to leave for South America.</p><p>In Puerto Maravilla, Chile, the Puppet Master is revealed to be behind everything. He appears to be talking to a \"customer.\" He has several women from around the world standing, as if in a trance. He mentions that he's retired the Puppet Master guise after being defeated by the Fantastic Four so many times. He has also obtained a new source of clay that seems to be stronger than what he used before.</p><p>When his customer doesn't seem to be overly impressed with his selection, he mentions having a collection that is more on the unique side (and will also cost more). In another room, Dusk, Stature, Tigra, ((and someone else I don't quite recognize)- It's Silverclaw) are standing, in a trance also. At that moment, another \"acquisition\" arrives. It is non other than Anya in a crate.</p>",

Find out what happened to Mary Marvel after she was left out in space two weeks ago by herself! See who crashes Ray's Christmas party!</p> <p>Plus, more DC villains origin backup stories. This week learn <strong>The Origin of Dr. Light</strong> by Scott Beatty and Howard Porter! </p> <p>The COUNTDOWN TO FINAL CRISIS continues! </p> <p>Flashback to two years ago, Jean Loring is being dragged away to her cell in Arkham Asylum. She screams back to her husband, Ray Palmer, the original Atom. He is so distraught over the fact that she killed Sue Dibny in order to win his love back. So overcome with grief and wanting to get away, he shrinks down smaller and smaller.</p> <p>Ray wakes up to the nightmare. Lying next to him in bed is Jean. She asks if he's okay. He tells her it's just a dream and goes to the bathroom to splash water on his face. He tells himself to just let go of the past. Heading back to bed, and Jean, we see that he is on Earth 51.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in outer space, another Jean Loring, still under the influence of Eclipso, searches for the remains of Mary Marvel. She figures after being left floating lost in space for two weeks, Mary's bound to be a basket case. It should be easy to take her powers now. Mary surprise Eclipso by fighting back. She says she should've known she was only interested in stealing her powers just like everyone else. Elcipso, now on the run, tries hitting Mary with everything she has. It's not enough. Mary swoops after her, telling her she's dead.</p> <p>Back on Earth 51, Ray is at the Arkham Institute for Emotional Disorders talking to an old friend turned psychiatrist, Zatanna. He talks to her about his nightmare and how peaceful their world is. He knows he should be at peace but just can't shake the dreams.</p> <p>Later there is a Christmas party at Ray's house. The other couples there are Ralph and Sue Dibny and Barry and Iris Allen. When Ralph goes out to get more wood for the fire, he is saddened to see a Monitor standing just on the other side of the fence to his yard.</p> <p>Back inside, the others are surprised when Ray returns with Donna Troy, Kyle Rayner, Jason Todd, and the Monitor. Ray apologizes to Jean, saying he was foolish to think he could avoid this forever. He decides to tell them his story.</p> <p>Ray tells them how he's not the Ray Palmer of their world. He tells them that his Jean murdered Sue. After shrinking away from his world, he came across a being that informed him of the multiverse. He eventually found a way to travel between worlds on a quantum level. He looked for himself on each world hoping to see a Ray that hadn't suffered as he had. On this world he found himself working on opening a gateway to alternate realities. He then saw himself die in an explosion when the experiment went wrong.<br /></p> <p>Ray was scientifically curious what \"he\" was working on. He now had a reason to stay on this world when he discovered that the research his other self was doing had catastrophic consequences if they weren't completed. He also discovered that this Ray had a blind date set up with Jean. He jumped into this world and tried to figure out what event caused this one to be so different than his own.</p> <p>Ray's friends have trouble grasping what he is telling them. The Monitor then steps up telling them all that everything he has said was true. Ray, not knowing who he was asked. The Monitor tells everyone that it is his job to become aware of and eliminate multiversal anomalies. Since Ray is not of this world, he tells him he must be eliminated.</p>",

            "description": "<p>In keeping with his athletic goal of issuing a volume of his occasionally lauded ACME series once every new autumn, volume 18 finds cartoonist Chris Ware abandoning the engaging serialization of his \"Rusty Brown\" and instead focusing upon his ongoing and more experimentally grim narrative, \"Building Stories.\"</p><p>Collecting pages unseen except in obscure alternative weekly periodicals and sophisticated expensive coffee table magazines, The ACME Novelty Library #18 re-introduces the characters which New York Times readers found \"dry\" and \"deeply depressing\" when one chapter of the work (not included here) was presented in its pages during 2005 and 2006. Set in a Chicago apartment building more or less in the year 2000, the stories move from the straightforward to the mnemonically complex, invading character's memories and personal ambitions with a text point size likely unreadable to human beings over the age of 45. Reformatted to accommodate this different material, readers will be pleased by the volume's vertical shape and tasteful design, which, unlike Ware's earlier volumes, should discreetly blend into any stack or shelf of real books.</p>",
