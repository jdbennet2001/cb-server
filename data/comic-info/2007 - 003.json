Come down from the mountain like a righteous wraith of vengeance, dispensing rough justice and then swinging off into the night. Things were going well, too…that is, until Mayor Waters dispatched his contingency plan -- the newly reassembled Sinister Six -- and things got complicated. Now Peter Parker isn’t just fighting for his very life, but to keep alive the spark of hope that’s been squelched under Waters' boot. But first, he’ll have to contend with the thing that was formerly known as Otto Octavius.</p><p>Following the defeat at the hands of the Sinner Six, Spider-Man is carried off by the seemingly dead remains of Doc Ock and his mechanical arms. He is taken to the cemetary where Uncle Ben, Aunt May, and Mary Jane are buried. Spider-Man flashbacks to when Mary Jane was lying in a hospital bed. He is saddened that she had been poisoned with radioactivity from him. He wasn't by her side as she passed on. As crime was occuring outside, she told him to \"Go get 'em, Tiger.\"</p><p>In the office of Mayor Waters,' J. Jonah Jameson is dragged in by Reign officers. Jameson believes that Waters is a monster but it turns out it is really his aide, Edward Saks. Saks appears to be bonded with the symbiote Venom.</p><p>In the city, as the Webb System is active, not allowing anyone to enter or leave the city, the children working with Jameson's underground decide to take on masks and fight. Venom reaches across the city consuming people as the sacrifice to protect the city.</p><p>As Mary Jane's corpse is seemingly dragged away from Peter, he follows. At her coffin, he enters and emerges in his \"red and blues.\"</p><p>It appears that the true Spider-Man is back just in time to take on Venom.</p>",

Hacking into a secure computer, Batman finds that Lex has data on a number of people including the late Dr. Eugene Underhay that Luthor was blackmailing in order to get Waynetech secrets. There is also an entry for Bruce Wayne (with not a whole lot of information) and Senator Crabtree, the senator that will decide between Waynetech and Lexcorp for the weapons contract. For some reason, the file also contain Senator Crabtree's DNA sequence.</p><p>Lex calls the senator to see if he's decided on which corporation to go with. The senator has decided to postpone the decision until they obtain more information as to what went wrong with the Waynetech system. Lex urges him to make a decsion stating that the senator has a lot he could lose if he waits.</p><p>Later at the senator's house, in the midst of a birthday party for his granddaughter, Captain James Gordon arrives with an arrest warrant for conspiracy to murder. It seems a hooker has been murdered and her child's DNA results say that Crabtree is the father. Batman was allegedly seen fleeing the scene.</p><p>With the senator dealing with his problems, Washington granted the contract to Lexcorp. Lucius express concern after Waynetech spent six years and half a billion dollars on the development of their plane. Bruce Wayne replies that he has plans for the plane.</p><p>On top of the Gothom City Police Department, Gordon tries calling Batman with the Bat-signal. As he is wanted for questioning in the murder of the hooker, snipers are in place waiting for him. After two hours, Gordon calls them off. As soon as he turns off the signal, he sees Batman standing there. Batman informs Gordon that he's been there the whole time waiting for the snipers to stand down. He didn't want to have to hurt them. Batman gives Gordon information that shows that Luthor set up Senator Crabtree. He tells Gordon to go after Luthor. With the source of the data, he tells Batman it won't be that easy.</p><p>Back at Luthorcorp, Lex talks to his technician, Clayton, to see if he's been able to track Batman to his lair. Clayton tells Luthor that Batman's plane is invisible to radar. They were able to track it using acoustic triangulation but lost it in a swarm of bats. Luthor has a solution to this problem. He shows Clayton a mechanical bat that would be able to track Batman.</p>",

A vicious struggle for control of the family barony is being settled through crossed swords, when Helmut Zemo is yanked through time again -- to post WWI Germany where he meets his Grandfather for the very first time...and learns of his family's involvement in a plot to assassinate Hitler! Meanwhile, in the present day, researcher/Zemo hater Wendell Volker finalizes his plans to return Helmut from his time-tossed state... and all it requires is a little Zemo blood... okay, a LOT of Zemo blood...</em></p><p><em>1879</em></p><p>Zemo has jumped to the time of Baron Hobart Zemo, tenth in his family lineage. This Zemo is under attack by assassination attempts. He is actually trying to find solutions the problems of the people that are trying to kill him. Zemo knows his assassination is inevitable but continues to help protect him. He knows he won't die on this date unless history got the date wrong. As he tries to shoot a killer approaching Hobart, Zemo feels himself being drawn away. History did get the date wrong.</p><p>Zemo now finds himself in 1932 by his grandfather, Baron Herman Zemo. German soldiers are fighting against the British and Union Jack (James Mongomery) is there. Zemo prevents Union Jack from striking his grandfather and soon begins trading punches with him. As Herman and his soldiers run towards them, Union Jack throws Zemo at them. Herman strikes Zemo across the face for allowing Union Jack to escape. Next they prepare to fire mustard gas on the British. Zemo begins to see his grandfather in a different light as he watches him and his soldiers celebrate their use chemical warefare.</p><p><em>Today</em></p><p>After Castle Zemo \"popped out of thing air,\" the German authorities have quarantined it as the lawyers fight over who owns it. Wendell Volker has been given permission to tour the castle along with a local policeman and Interpol agent. Volker comments on how in all his research, he has yet to find a Zemo worth respecting. He knows that Zemo is coming back. He believes it is inevitable. When asked what his research is about, he responds that it is about power, who has it and how they wield it. He kills both the policeman and agent. He says he has to be waiting for Zemo when he comes back. He says it's all about the blood. He feels he has no choice but to do these killings. He stands among at least a dozen dead bodies.</p><p>Back in 1932, Herman is boasting about the defeat of the British. Zemo tires of listening and begins to leave. Herman notices and asks where he is going. Zemo apologizes and says he does not like to listen to tales of toxic gases and the effects they have because of what he looks like under his mask. Herman then wants to study Zemo to better understand the potential of science. Zemo is outraged and grabs him. All the soldiers' guns are on Zemo as he begins to feel a chronal pull. Knowing he cannot let anyone see him disappear (since there was no mention in his grandfather's journals), Zemo jumps out the window just in time.</p><p>Zemo now finds himself closer to \"home.\" To his surprise, he finds Baron Heinrich Zemo and his scientists being congratulated by a visiting Adolf Hitler.</p>",

Willow takes her on in a witches' battle royal as hundreds of Slayers defend their Scottish citadel, but without the kiss of true love, Buffy will be out of commission indefinitely-with an unwelcome familiar face, and an image you won't soon forget.</p><p>Buffy creator Joss Whedon brings Buffy back to Dark Horse in this direct follow-up to Season Seven of the smash-hit TV series.</p><p>Buffy is locked in her own dreams. As she slumbers, she hears someone say, \"My love.\" In mild disgust, she realises it's Ethan Rayne, ex-associate of her mentor Giles. Ethan has come to tell her that she's not just stuck in her dreams, she's been locked in her dreamspace, the place where she is constantly dreaming, even when she's awake. He tells her that he managed to get in by hitching a ride when Amy put a spell on Buffy. He says that all dreaming spells require a small piece of the person casting it to be used. With his help, Buffy breaks through to Amy's own dreamspace where she sees Willow battling the evil witch.</p><p>On the outside, Willow is fighting Amy and letting her appear to win. When Amy questions how she got so weak, Willow simply tells her that she's decoding her mojo. Then she blasts Amy to the ground. Just as Amy springs back and throws a bolt at Willow, Dawn appears and smooshes Amy to the ground with her giant foot.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in Amy's dreamspace, Buffy discovers the ratcage then a massive cage made of three Xs. Ethan gives her a mysterious message that she must remember everything she sees because twilight is falling and she'll need all te help she can get.</p><p>Once Amy is restrained, Willow, Xander and the rest of the slayers congregate in Buffy's room. Willow tells them that only true love's kiss can wake her. She tells them all to close their eyes and whoever loves Buffy is to step forward and kiss her. As it's done, Buffy jolts awake to the cry \"Cinnamon buns!\"</p><p>The search begins for the symbolism that Buffy describes, plus the strange symbol from issue 1. Giles speaks to the demons that were lured to be killed by Buffy and her slayers. Giles tries to convince them that the slayers didn't trick them, that it was something deeper and to give him all the information they can.</p><p>As Willow tries to read Amy's mind and sees some kind of military installment, she's sucked into a portal and captured. Buffy tries to follow her but she just misses it. As Willow wakes up, she finds herself restrained to a table with a man she thought was dead standing over her.... With relish, Warren tells her that she really got under his skin!</p>",

He arrives in Pisa, Italy. He senses the thoughts of all around. Everyone dealing with the trauma of the attack. Survivors searching for friends and family in the wreckage. The Doom Patrol trying to pick up their own pieces. The panic and the fear brings out their despair until the Justice Society of America arrives.</p> <p>The JSA does its best to help remove the wreckage and search out survivors. Some people fear them because Black Adam was part of their team before. Others still cling on to hope and defend their character. One man asks what will they do if Black Adam returns. This question causes Martian Manhunter to reach out and search for him again.</p> <p>In Greece, Black Adam is fighting against the Teen Titans. Beast Boy has gathered a new team of young heroes. The battle doesn't appear to be going to well for them. Zatara is knocked out and Frankenstein gets his arms ripped off. Black Adam leaves. He says he does not enjoy the deaths of children. If they cross his path again, perhaps he will change his mind.<br /></p> <p>Beast Boy orders the remaining Titans to follow Black Adam. Raven is concerned about leaving Zatara and Frankenstein behind. Being an empath, she can feel the pain he is in. J'onn arrives in the guise of a medical worker. He sees Frankenstein lying on the ground. He is surprised that he is still conscious after losing so much blood. As his life slips away, J'onn enters his mind, trying to soothe his mind and take away all the fear and pain. He notes that it doesn't matter if you're human or martian, in the end, everyone dies alone.</p> <p>In Detroit, Amanda Waller visits Ben Turner. She tells him that Rick Flag is still alive and that she wants to put \"the band\" back together (perhaps the Suicide Squad) and needs him to lead them. Ben laughs at the thought that she is trying to create a secret agency within a secret agency.</p> <p><i>Week 50, Day 6, The Himalayas</i></p> <p>The Titans have found Black Adam and continue the fight. Black Adam tells them that he tried to warn them and he will not be responsible for their deaths. Raven pulls him so that her soul self can release the anger and grief inside him. He tears his way out. Terra throws two huge boulders at Adam. Black Adam easily smashes through them. He says she is a \"kitten playing at war with a lion.\" Black Adam then punches through Terra's chest. Raven convinces Beast Boy to let Adam leave so that they can take care of their own. Hawk and Dove can still be saved and they can still bury Terra.</p> <p>Martian Manhunter comes in on the end of a conversation between Director Bones and Kate Spencer (whom he's figured out is Manhunter). He figures this deal will not be good and makes note to pursue it later.</p> <p>After witnessing lies and theft on Kate's part, J'onn returns to the precinct in Denver where he began his lie. He finds his old partner, Peter Santorelli, and reveals his true identity. He induces laughter in him to lessen the shock of this discovery. Peter asks why he's telling him about his secret and J'onn says so that he will never do it again.</p> <p>J'onn next goes to the Terrel Building where he worked as a private investigator after leaving the police force. It's been empty for decades and is set to be demolished. He worked there with another partner, Diane Meade. He says that he failed her and she died because of him. All he sees is lies and he lashes out. The building is destroyed. He says now it is the time for an ending.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>It's Batman and Blue Beetle versus the Fatal Five in the team-up book to end all team-up books! Who's brought these Legion villains into the fray? The Lord of Time, who has pulled in assassins and villains from throughout the history of the DCU!</p><p>In the desert outside of El Paso, Texas, Batman and Blue Beetle are suddenly hit with a drastic change in weather. The temperature drops to twenty-five degrees fahrenheit below zero with extreme snow and wind. Blue Beetle blames himself for getting them into this situation. He begins arguing with his armor to get both of them out of there. With visibility reduced to nothing, Blue Beetle quickly loses sight of Batman. With the wind, he can't even tell which way is up or down. Feeling the ground beneath him, he fires a big blast straight down, causing an avalanche. Flying around, he calls out to Batman. One of Batman's fists breaks the surface of the snow. As Beetle begins to dig him out, he asks Batman to \"crack out the Bat-snowblower.\" The snow begins to melt and Batman is standing free. He didn't actually have a Bat-snowblower but a short-duration infrared ordnance device, packed by habit, from going against Mr. Freeze so often.</p><p>Blue Beetle warms up Batman with his armor and continues to apologize. Batman says it's okay. They were lucky that Batman was targeted and not Blue Beetle. The weapon that was fired at Batman alters probability to maximize the odds of a kill. Batman says he survived because it didn't take Blue Beetle's armor into account.</p><p>Blue Beetle tries tracking the energy signature of the weapon but his armor's tracking seems to be out of whack. He apologizes again saying he's not making excuses. Batman tells him to relax. Beetle is confused that Batman is being so nice to him.</p><p>Soon Batman tracks down an arms dealer that sells exotic weapons (\"Max,\" who had moved away from Gotham). As Batman tries to strong-arm him, Blue Beetle watches and comments to himself that he thinks he just peed himself seeing Batman in action. He then gets an idea as to where the weapon could be, just as Batman threatens to start breaking some bones.</p><p>On Ventura, Supergirl is trying to get a ride to Rann. After Hal left, she has no idea how to get there or back to Earth. No one wants to help, after she caused them all to lose money when they bet against her when she fought in the arena. When she mentions she can turn coal into diamonds, an alien says he knows of a \"navigator\" that can take her.</p><p>Lobo is seen bound in front of a firing squad. They shoot at him only to find that he is no longer there; Supergirl has snatched him away at high speed. Lobo has no idea who she is until she flashes her S-symbol at him. It seems it is enough to buy her some credit for his help. Then she steals his space-bike out of the police impound lot.</p><p>Outside of local crimelord La Dama's estate, Blue Beetle and Batman look in. Blue Beetle mentions that she makes it a point not to become too big, to avoid \"unwanted attention.\" Blue Beetle has had some run-ins with her, and knows that she's gathered some magical artifacts. Inside, Neferto is trying to sell the Haruspex weapon to her, bargaining for a teleport device. Suddenly the clock and television start acting up. A doorway opens up in mid-air, and Epoch, the Lord of Time arrives. He claims to have traveled hundreds of centuries to claim the Haruspex as his own. With it, he plans to conquer the Amazon Galaxy.</p><p>Despite being surrounded by a roomful of La Dama's armed guards, and their \"primitive bangsticks,\" the Lord of Time is not concerned. He has brought along the Fatal Five, the scourge of the 31st Century. The Fatal Five consists of Mano, Persuader, Emerald Empress, Tharok, and Validus. Neferto is aiming the Haruspex when he is hit in the head by a Batarang. Blue Beetle enters, claiming that Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern are behind them so they should all just give up.</p><p>La Dama and Neferto flee outside through a hidden passage, with Batman in pursuit. La Dama manages to get the Haruspex as Batman begins fighting Epoch. La Dama targets Batman but he advises her against it. Killing him would make her known to the world and she wouldn't be able to keep her quiet crimelord ways. Of course, she's already got Batman knowing her home address... still she buys this argument long enough to hesitate for just a bit too long.</p><p>The Fatal Five bring their fight outside. La Dama shoots Validus with the Haruspex, and he is encased in some sort of goopy insulation material. The Lord of Time is knocked unconscious, so a failsafe circuit in his armor whisks him away to his native era, and just like that, the Fatal Five are stranded. The cyborg Tharok gets the Haruspex in sight and heads towards La Dama and Neferto. She targets him with the Haruspex when Batman jumps into her line of fire. With both targeted, there is a big flash as the weapon is discharged. Blue Beetle gets to his feet looking for Batman. He is astonished when he sees a half Batman, half Tharok merged into one.</p>",

With more and more of the Marvel heroes being infected, will <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ash</a> make it through and will he get some sugar?</p><p>We start off with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ashley Williams</a>, feeling down about his life. He seems to be missing something. Life seems to be missing something. Even the battle of superheroes doesn't excite him. He is in agreement over <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\" href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/4005-1487/\">J. Jonah Jameson's</a> tirades against <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\" href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> and other masked menaces. One day working at S-Mart, in the television department, he saw the news about the heroes in Times Square, killing everyone. It was time for him to do something. Grabbing a chainsaw and shotgun, he set out to become a hero.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ashley Williams</a> saw lots of strange things, including zombified heroes eating other heroes. He had some run-ins with them and put his chainsaw to good use. None of that prepared him for what he saw next. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\" href=\"/ash/4005-11302/\">Ashley G.

The book tells him to \"get bent\" so he throws it in the fireplace. Grabbing another, this one is quicker to cooperate.

            "description": "<p>Overview</p><p>Jeff Smith's amazing Shazam miniseries continues! Billy and Mary have been captured by Sivana... so Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel may not be able to stop Mr. Mind's Monster Society from taking over the world.</p><p>Captain Marvel flies after his sister Mary now that she's recently gained powers of her own.  The two giant creatures are still standing in the distance.  Mary lands on top of one.  She asks him if he knew that they are not alive.  Captain Marvel doesn't understand what she's talking about.  She says they're not moving.  Marvel says that they were earlier when they almost squished him.  She explains that they're not vibrating the way living things do.  Captain Marvel is surprised that she must have the abiltity to sense lifeforce which is the gift of the Goddess Athena.  He says he doesn't have that power and Mary says of course not since he's a boy.  Mary thinks that they must be robots and that Mr. Mind must be in one of them.  She calls him out but there is no reply.  Marvel says he's probably waiting for the third one to appear.  Mr. Mind said that once the third one appears, he was going to wipe out civilization.</p><p>Mary gets a spooky chill down her spine as a helicopter appears in front of them.  They are from the Department of Heartland Security and order Captain Marvel to surrender.  He tries saying he's on their side when they open fire on them.  He shields Mary since he is not sure if she is bullet proof and flies off.</p><p>They arrive at Billy's place and revert back to their human forms.  When he turns on the light, he is surprised that there aren't any cockroaches.  They usually scatter whenever he turns them on.  Mary turns on the tv only to find that the news is on.  There is a report that talks about all the bugs in the city being gone.  Billy thinks that it must be connected to all the ants he saw headed towards the park.</p><p>Mary hears someone at the door and opens it.  Two agents stand there and grab them.  Dr. Sivana is behind them and tells them to cover the kids' mouth so they can't say their magic words.  Lagreen walks in and Sivana asks him to identify the kids.  He says it's them.  Sivana orders his men to tape their mouths and tie their hands.  He gives Billy a pad of paper to answer his questions.  He asks if he's plotting with the aliens to take over the country.  Billy writes down that they're trying to stop them.  Sivana then orders Billy to stop interacting with the creatures.  Billy tries saying that Captain Marvel can help but Sivana tells him not to question his orders. When Mary tells  him that they're robots, that makes Sivana even more happy.  He says robots are tools for war and war is profitable.<br /></p><p>Dr. Sivana takes Billy to the park with Lagreen and his buddy working for him.  They are carrying sensitive equimpment for him.  Looking at the robots, Sivana notices a little sensor pop out of the foot of one of them.  He tells Lagreen and his buddy to charge towards it to see what happens.  Proud to serve their country agains terrorists, they run towards the robot.  They fall to the ground and begin to transform into weird creaturs.  They turn around and head towards Sivana.  He tries to order them to stop because he's the Attorney General of the United States.  That doesn't stop them so Sivana tries to take off the tape on Billy's mouth.  It won't come off so easily so he runs off, telling the creatures to eat Billy instead.</p><p>Billy manages to loosen his ropes just as the creatures are about to reach him.  He gets the tape off just in time to yell, \"Shazam!\"  He takes on the creatures and Sivana returns telling Captain Marvel to look at the changing ray.  Captian Marvel races towards it and smashes it.  Sivana yells at him that he shouldn't have broken it because it'd be worth millions.<br /></p><p>The words are echoed as a bunch of other creatures surround him.  They tell him that they are the Monster Society and were created by Mr. Mind.  He has awakened their true selves.  He is their enemy.  They begin fighting.  One of the creatures heads towards Sivana.  As he cries out, some of his agents overhear the battle.  They fire tear gas which allows the Monster Society to escape.  They have taken Sivana with them.  The army only sees Captain Marvel but he is able to escape also.</p><p>Later, Billy is sittin alone on the docks.  Talky Tawny, in his human form, finds Billy.  Billy is happy to see Talky.  He tells him how Dr. Sivana took them and doesn't want them fighting the Monster Society because he wants to be able to sell their weapons.  They try to think of what they can do to save Mary.  Talky suggests going to the authorities but with Dr. Sivana in charge of things, no one will likely believe them.  Billy decides they should tell the media.  If they can expose Sivana on tv, the police and FBI will help them get Mary back.</p><p>Billy heads to the news station to try to talk to the owner, Sterling Morris.  No one will take him seriously, not even the reporter, Helen Fidelity.  He walks away and reappears as Captain Marvel.  Helen checks him out and says she can see why they call him Captain Marvel.  She is all over him but he says he will only give his information to the station owner.</p><p>Talky makes his way to the park as a regular housecat.  The army is on edge and practically shoot him.  In one of the robots, a door opens and two human-sized come out.</p><p>Captain Marvel speaks with Mr. Morris.  Morris is willing to help search for the kidnapped girl but can't run a story exposing Dr. Sivana without any evidence.  He suggests Captain Marvel capture him on film and hands him a small camera.  As he flies off, Helen asks Morris why he trusts him.  He says if he's right, he's doing the country a great favor and it will also make a great story.  If he's wrong, the government will be able to track him with the camera.<br /></p><p>Billy sneaks into the park and meets up with Talky, now in his tiger-guise.  Outside the door on the robot, the two agentst that took Mary are standing guard.  Billy is ready to charge in as he figures Sivana and Mary must be inside.  Talky tells him they have to proceed with caution.  He says that while Captain Marvel was talking to Mr. Morris, he was talking to Shazam.  Shazam says Billy is in grave danger.  He reminds him of the Shazam Paradox.  You cannot perform magic at the Rock of Eternity because magic withing magic could make his powers go out of control.  He says the monster may have come through the Rock of Eternity.  Billy is impatient and doesn't understand what that has to do with anything.  He storms off and says, \"Shazam!\" before Talky can finish his thought.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Grifter and Midnighter are in it up to their necks as the City of Lights becomes Beachhead Francois for a deadly extraterrestrial invasion. What started as a routine covert op turns into an intergalactic bloodbath with no mission objective other than survival.<br/></p><p>Picking up immediately from the end of last issue, Grifter, Midnighter and Zee face off against a seemingly endless flood of aliens in Paris, France. Grifter, as usual, jumps, guns blazing, straight into battle leaving Midnighter with Zee. The time alone (well, not alone, the monsters are still attacking) gives Zee a chance to drop cryptic clues about what's going on. She tells Midnighter that he is at the center of a synergy and the tentacled creatures seek him for the same reason she does. Midnighter again asks her who she is, but her reply is simply, \"I am Zee.\" Midnighter promises to hunt down Jenny for the rest of her unnaturally long life if he finds out that she's connected to any of this. Before he can attempt to pry more answers from Zee, a helpless woman is attacked by an alien and he is forced to save her. While Midnighter fights more monsters, Zee, who had jumped away and is now perched safely atop a building, talks to him. She tells Midnighter that he is an enhanced being, but even he has limits. He was kidnapped (read issue 1) to assess those limits. The master of the creatures he's fighting has studied him. This prompts Midnighter to ask Zee which side she's on but she tells him that it's not that simple. Midnighter insists that it is but Zee goes on to talk about something seemingly unrelated: Midnighter's powers. She explains that his neural upgrades allow him to work through a million scenarios a second and he sees each possible encounter and reacts with the best option. Midnighter says she's right and she responds by saying that's only true if he processes probabilities faster than his opponents. If the enemy is one second faster, can find the one scenario he hasn't reached yet, his enhancements are useless. As she says this, Midnighter is outmaneuvered by an alien and struck. She tells him that his ability has created a necessary level of confidence, but confidence leads to arrogance, and arrogance leads to complacency. While she's speaking, two more aliens grab Midnighter from behind and the original attacker shoots a tentacle through Midnighters torso and beats him mercilessly. Zee tells Midnighter that only one thing can save him, a significant variable. Grifter. </p><p>The red-masked, gun-wielding Wildcat jumps over the alien attacking Midnighter and kills all the monsters around him. After they die, green \"brain bugs\", smaller, ghost-like bugs inside the aliens, scuttle out of the dead bodies and teleport away. With Midnighter now relatively safe and Grifter holding the bugs back with his guns, Zee decides to step in. She pushes Grifter away and tells him that the two of them will serve. Zee, rapidly losing her normal form and turning into something with skin like the aliens, is seemingly destroyed when a giant tentacle smacks down directly on her. The few remaining aliens all run away and Grifter drags Midnighter away from the battlefield. </p><p>Soon after the duo are gone, Apollo, Swift, The Engineer and The Doctor arrive on the scene. They can find no sign of Midnighter (and they're not looking for Grifter) but they find a giant hole in the ground. Apollo flies down inside of it but finds nothing.</p><p>In the sewers some distance away, Midnighter heals the hole in his chest along with his broken jaw and arm while Grifter annoys him. When they get up they see Zee and she tells them there's a planet to save.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Mighty Avengers versus the next gen Ultron! Ultron has taken over everything by taking over Iron Man! And now she has to face the Sentry unleashed! A battle of the titans Avengers style! Plus, Tigra guest stars. Yes, Tigra. Frank Cho drawing Tigra!! Did you hear us? FRANK CHO DRAWING TIGRA!! Which Avenger is Tigra dating? Prrrrr!!</em></p><p>Ares, Sentry, Wonder Man, Ms. Marvel, Wasp and Black Widow stand in front of Ultron and try to get some answers. They ask her how she's controlling the weather and she tells them she has new interface tools. She doesn't give them any information as to what happened to Tony, what she's doing or why. Ms. Marvel thinks they should retreat but Ares vehemently disagrees. It's decided that Sentry will stay and the rest will go to try to figure something out.</p><p>As the team goes, Sentry attacks but gets punched into the ground. He keeps fighting but Ultron takes everything Bob can throw at her and keeps fighting back. She says that there is no place for him in this world and that he should leave while he can. The battle keeps raging while the rest of the team makes it to the helicarrier.</p><p>Wonder Man saves someone from an exploding aircraft right before they get inside, and when they do, Jan get SHIELD to contact Hank Pym.</p><p>At the moment, Hank is about to have sex with Tigra. The phone is ringing in the background, but he ignores it. He gets closer to Tigra and she asks about Jan. Hank says he's done with her, but the phone keeps ringing, someone's knocking on his door, and he's getting mail on his computer. Just as things are about to get interesting, a SHIELD squad barges into the room, guns drawn and barrels aimed at a pantless Hank Pym.</p><p>Back on the helicarrier, scientists check the energies that Ms. Marvel had absorbed from Ultron. They plan to figure out what exactly those energies are and hopefully use that data to come up with a way to beat the robot. Ares argues with Wasp about what happened to Tony and how Ultron appeared. Wasp says that it took over Tony's form while Ares insists that it may have appeared in his place. Ares' opinion seems to be disregarded when everyone listens to Wasp.</p><p>At the same time all of this is going on, Ultron and Sentry are still fighting. Suddenly Ultron stops. In the helicarrier, all the screens and monitors shut off and when they come back on, Ultron's old, robot face is the only thing on them. Sentry tries to attack while Ultron is distracted, but she easily stops his attempt. She says that his defeat has been calculated and executed. Sentry looks up only to see the helicarrier falling straight down towards him. He flies up to catch it, but can barely hold it. As it's slipping from his grip, Wonder Man and Ms. Marvel fly out to help him bring it to a safe landing.</p><p>Inside, Maria Hill has been knocked out and a new leader needs to be chosen. Worker of SHIELD scramble around trying to figure out who protocol says should be in charge until Black Widow says that she's a Level 10, making her ranking officer. She quickly jumps into the role of captain and starts barking orders. She demands reports and analysis from every department, for all world leaders to be alerted, for all members of the initiative to be on guard, for Reed Richards to be brought to her, and for the helicarrier to get back in the air. Ares sees her skill at command and falls instantly in love. The fliers of the team go outside to check on Ultron, but she's nowhere to be found.</p><p>Above them, Hank Pym's helicopter slows to look at the destruction, but it doesn't stop. He has to be somewhere else. After he leaves, something else comes into view in the sky. A glowing blue figure is flying towards the downed helicarrier and everyone on board. Ares is ready to fight and everyone's guns are drawn, but Black Widow tells them to stand down. The figure pulls closer and is revealed. It's one of Iron Man's old suits and it has this message: \"Attention, Avengers. If you are receiving this message, Tony Stark is dead. Listen carefully...\"</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>THE MEGA SMASH MINI SERIES IS BACK!! Years ago a mysterious creature called the Beyonder gathered the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe for an epic called SECRET WARS. Now, finally, after decades of mystery, the TRUE origin of this powerful creature is revealed when the Illuminati try to stop the Beyonder from interfering with the Earth once more.</p><p>What powerful connection does the Beyonder's true origin have to one of the power players of the Illuminati? Another stunner from Bendis (NEW AVENGERS, MIGHTY AVENGERS) Reed (MS. MARVEL) and Jim Cheung (YOUNG AVENGERS)</p><p>Professor Xavier recalls the events of the first Secret War and appearance of The Beyonder. He remembers that he had thought about using his psychic powers to put all the heroes and villains to sleep, but had reconsidered out of fear that Beyonder would retaliate if he interfered. He had felt something in the Beyonder’s mind though, something “almost mutant in nature.” He mentally reached out and found himself pulled inside of the Beyonder’s consciousness. Inside, he discovered that the alien was not the cosmic being it pretended to be, but really an Inhuman. Not only that though, he was also a mutant. On the moon outside Attilan, Professor Xavier explained to the other members of The Illuminati (save Iron Man who was away) that the Beyonder was a mutant who had Inhuman that had been exposed to the Terrigen crystals.</p><p>Namor asks why Xavier is bringing this up now and Professor says that he’s recently been feeling that The Beyonder is close again so they should “handle” him before he gets to them. Strange asks Black Bolt, king of the Inhumans if he knows who The Beyonder is, but Black Bolt has no idea. Xavier says he knows where Beyonder is but the others don’t know what they’ll do once they get to him. Namor says that they won’t have to do anything, that Beyonder will bow before Black Bolt and beg forgiveness.</p><p>The group takes a stolen Skrull ship that Namor says they should have destroyed, and flies to the asteroid belt where Xavier detects The Beyonder. As they get closer, Dr. Strange grows weak, saying that something unnatural is going on. The ship moves up and they see what he’s talking about. The entire island of Manhattan has been duplicated and is floating in the asteroid belt. Reed parks the ship on the Baxter Building and the team gets out to look around. They see people on the streets below but Strange tells them that they’re not real. Reed spots Beyonder and amongst a group of heroes and realizes that Beyonder has created all of this to be his own personal playground. After Reed sees Beyonder, Beyonder turns and sees the Illuminati. He teleports to where they’re standing and is genuinely surprised to see anyone new. He wonders if he created them and made himself forget so it would be a special treat for himself, but once he sees Black Bolt he knows they are real. Beyonder bows before his king but before he can say much, he is attacked by a fake Hulk. The Illuminate remain calm and Beyonder tells them that he forgot he had scheduled that attack. He resumes speaking with Black Bolt and tells his king that he can talk hear because Beyonder can control everything so he’ll do no damage. Everyone else tells him not to and Strange says that Beyonder is messing with the natural order of things. Reed goes on to say that Beyonder’s very existence threatens the universe and that, basically, he is unnatural and doesn’t belong. Beyonder ignores all of this and asks Black Bolt how he’s still alive after so long. Xavier asks him how long he thinks it has been but Beyonder doesn’t reply. Namor tells him to leave the universe and Xavier says that he shouldn’t be interfering with the development of the species. Beyonder replies by saying that <i>they</i> interfere, but Strange says that that’s because it’s their species, not his. Beyonder says he just wants to do good, and that he can make the world however they want.</p><p>Suddenly the world changes and Dr. Strange wakes up in a bed with two naked women. Above him, Iron Men, mutants and cars fly through the sky. Beyonder makes it so the Atlanteans are invading the surface world and tells Namor that he can give them everything they want. Strange does a spell and Namor begins to speak the words Black Bolt wants to say. He tells Beyonder that he is not a god, he is not immortal he demands that Beyonder stop what he’s doing and leave the universe immediately. Beyonder seems to comply and everything turns to dust. The Illuminati decide it’s time to go.</p><p>As they pile into the ship, they talk about Beyonder. Xavier and Strange no longer detect his presence and say that what happened should not have worked. Beyonder could have destroyed them if he wanted to. Reed questions if Namor still wants to conquer the surface world and he says, “Only sometimes.” Black Bolt is embarrassed that he doesn’t remember The Beyonder from when he lived with other Inhumans and Xavier tells him it’s not his fault. The ship disappears into dark space that becomes the black pupils of Beyonder’s eyes. The Beyonder resumes his activities in his Manhattan playground.</p>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>(Los Angeles, California)</p><p>Phil Urich (<a href=\"/phil-urich/4005-2246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2246\">Green Goblin</a>) recounts what happened previously in a letter to himself. His <a href=\"/the-daily-bugle/4055-56827/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56827\">Daily Bugle</a> reporter uncle, <a href=\"/ben-urich/4005-4799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4799\">Ben Urich</a>, once wrote, 'Madness consumed every Green Goblin.' Every single one of them... but him. Long ago, Phil had told himself that he'd break the curse by being a Goblin, not becoming one. He refused to be haunted by the ghosts of the past. After his Goblin costume was destroyed, he moved out here to LA to start fresh. He quickly found out that he wasn't alone - he hooked up with Mickey Musashi, another ex-New Yorker and ex-super hero trying to start over.</p><p>While trading vigilante war stories, the two were reminded of how often they did more harm than good. Increased membership into their group meant increased temptation... some members felt the urge to put on their costumes again. Phil, being the only one without his costume, admits to himself that it does bother him. It actually hurts more when they lie about it.</p><p>Phil is pretty sure it was Darkhawk, Spider-Woman and Ricochet who went out and busted up the MGH lab; he saw the looks on their faces when he brought it up at the meeting. He knew that Mattie must have 'charmed' Chris and Johnny to do her dirty work, but he worries if Mickey might go. Would she lie to him? It couldn't be Julie - her lights would have been a dead giveaway. Phil worries that he thinks the others feel sorry that he can't do what they do. Phil goes into a stream of bitter thoughts... let them keep their secrets. He doesn't need their <i>pity</i>. He knows they're weak. That's it... they're not as strong as he is. They can't put their pasts behind them. Him? He's in control... like when he was the Goblin. The ghosts that haunted the previous Green Goblins never got the better of him! He knows how to handle them. He's locked them away inside, never to be seen again. The joke's on Excelsior. Phil ends off his letter by repeatedly writing a maniacal \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"</p><p>(A hospital bathroom - night)</p><p>As Phil vomits into the toilet, he thinks to himself - if there was one word he'd use to sum up his life, it'd have to be control. He likes having it... but hates losing it, like how he is right now (he vomits more). Getting up, he begins to pull himself together. He kept a tight reign upon his life; there should be no reason a little stress right now should freak him out. However... confrontation of any kind always sickens him. When he knows there's a fight coming, he can feel himself slowly slipping away. As he washes his face beside the sink, he realizes he must pull himself together - after all, how can he <i>lead</i> a group of misfit ex-super heroes when he can't even control the demons that lurk inside of him? The devilish spirit of the Green Goblin stares out at him from the bathroom mirror.</p><p>Phil leaves the bathroom, all the while thinking of the enemy within him. The skeleton in his closet - the devil inside. Phil can call it whatever he wants, but just when he thinks he put a wall between him and his past... his past always comes back to haunt him. As Phil walks down the hospital hall, he reflects on how he used to call himself the 'Heroic' Green Goblin. He didn't have any powers of his own, just what came with his the costume that he inherited. After the suit was destroyed, he told himself he was finished with the superhero life. A reason why he's been doing his best to help others follow in his footsteps. Because, if there is one thing he has learned from being a super hero, it's that no matter how hard you try to do the right thing, someone always gets hurt. And the last thing anyone needs is more blood on their hands... quite unlike Johnny Gallo (Ricochet) who has blood spattered all over him. Phil has arrived in the lobby of the hospital, where Johnny, Mickey (Turbo), Mattie (Spider-Woman) and Chris (Darkhawk) are sitting. No Julie Power (Lightspeed).</p><p>Phil storms angrily over to Johnny, who is still in his Ricochet gear. Phil is enraged with Johnny's betrayal - going behind their backs and re-donning his costume. Has he even been listening for the past months? He grabs Johnny's bandage angrily and shows him how someone could have gotten hurt. Phil tells Johnny that this is what happens when he puts on his mask - Mickey, however, stops the fight by reminding them that this still is a hospital. She tells Phil that there will be time for lectures later; Johnny already feels bad enough about what happened to...</p><p>At the same time, a Dr. Steeves drives Julie Power by in a gurney. Julie is sick and pale. Although Excelsior immediately rush towards her, Dr. Steeves backs them off, telling them that Julie made it through surgery and is in a stable condition. Fortunately, the lacerations she suffered were clean - almost surgical. Steeves gives them a hardened look and asks what happened to her. Chris, Mickey, Phil and Mattie sheepishly make up excuses, but Johnny remains silent. Steeves knows they are lying, but leaves them to it. She does, however, mention that with all the new registration laws (the Superhuman Registration Act), he is legally obligated to report it to the authorities. Phil immediately tells Steeves that Julie is registered - but retired. Phil turns to the rest of Excelsior and bitterly adds to Dr. Steeves, \"They're <i>all</i> retired\". Mickey asks what Phil means by 'They.' Dr. Steeves is relieved to hear that Julie is registered, but he plans on informing her parents of what happened to their daughter. Even though he doesn't have all the answers they'll be looking for. Once Dr. Steeves leaves, Excelsior turns upon Johnny, and Phil asks Johnny for answers they'll all be looking for. Johnny finally explains.</p><p>(flashback - MGH base of operations)</p><p>Hollow steps out of her experimental pod, flexing her claws at Ricochet, all the while fearfully looking around the room. With a frightening monstrous appearance, she stands the same size as Ricochet, even though she is crouching down. Hollow makes eye contact with Ricochet, and immediately lunges at him; Ricochet knocks her back inside her crashed pod. Just before Hollow steps back out, in a swirl of rainbow colors, Lightspeed bursts into the room. Lightspeed's lights dazzle Hollow, and is almost lured into a false sense of security. Lightspeed comforts Hollow by putting her hand on her shoulder. For a second, Hollow stares morosely down at the end. She then glares at the hand, and quick as a flash, she lunges her claws straight through Lightspeed's chest. Ricochet catches Lightspeed before she falls, and grabs her and runs to the hospital. Hollow sees them run off, a tear slowly trickling down her monstrous face. As Phil listens to the story, he thinks, \"Once a monster, always a monster.\"</p><p>(The hospital lobby - now)</p><p>Johnny finishes his story. Chris comforts him, and tells him he did the right thing bringing her to the hospital. Mattie also agrees - there was nothing he could have done. Phil, however, asks what was he doing in a Fujikawa lab in the first place. A horrible realization comes to Johnny - Hollow wasn't the only woman in an experimental pod. Johnny tells Excelsior there are other women there, being held captive just like Hollow. He manages to rush outside the hospital, but Phil, Chris and Mickey hold him back. Standing in the parking lot, Phil tells Johnny that he's had no idea what he's gotten himself into. Staying out of this kind of trouble is exactly why they formed this group. Mattie, becomes enraged - she immediately sides with Johnny; when you have powers, responsibilities come with them. They have to save those innocent women. Phil snaps at Mattie, and tells her he is sick of hearing what she has to say. How do they even know that the women are innocent? For all they know, Johnny could have even broken into a legal operation. If they call the cops, they themselves may get arrested. Despite this, Mattie still feels it was a MGH operation. Phil ignores her, and asks if Mickey has anything to say. With the groups pressure on her, Mickey sides with Johnny and Mattie - they need to find out who did this to Julie. Chris says they don't have to look that far ... Hollow is standing there at the other end of the parking lot.</p><p>Johnny becomes shocked - he doesn't know how she found them. Mattie suggests it may have been a tracking ability; she followed the smell of blood. Although Phil warns the group not to do anything, Chris immediately activates his Darkhawk amulet and Mattie's spider-legs emerge from her back. Phil wonders if anything he says sinks in. The monstrous Hollow fearfully backs away from Excelsior. But as Phil stares at Hollow, he wonders ... \"Once a monster, always a monster?\" Despite Excelsior's warnings, Phil walks towards Hollow, realizing he knows what it's like to feel misunderstood. About not judging somone by their appearance. Phil and Hollow, two monsters often misunderstood stare at one another, understanding each other. Hollow slowly pulls him into a kiss, and after pulling away, she whispers \"Like\". Suddenly, there is a loud hissing noise from behind them. As Hollow shields Phil protectively, a voice calls out \"I see your senses are as keen as ever, Hollow\".</p><p>Materializing from invisibility is a Japanese woman, the assassin Delilah, and several other gun-weilding men. The Japanese woman is Miss Fujikawa, the head of the MGH dealer's operation. Fujikawa walks towards Excelsior and Hollow and tells them that Hollow running away has cost her a substantial amount of money. Fujikawa walks towards Hollow, but Phil smacks her away. Fujikawa warns Phil not to touch her again. She knows who he and Excelsior are; they've been a thorn in her side for a while. Since Excelsior had stopped Nekra, she had been forced to release all her other donors from her old lab. She does not plan on losing Hollow. Although Phil tells her that it wasn't them who stopped Nekra, Miss Fujikawa tells him to keep better watch on his teammates. Spider-Woman snaps, and calls Fujikawa a twisted witch for harvesting innocent people for her sick MGH experiments. Fujikawa tells Mattie she doesn't care; it's profit to her. She does not let morals get in the way of her business. Right before Spider-Woman and Darkhawk attack Fujikawa, Mickey stops the fight. She is bitter with the secret Darkhawk, Spider-Woman and Ricochet had kept from the rest of Excelsior. Walking towards Miss Fujikawa, Mickey speaks to her in Japanese, so both of them can settle matters. Fujikawa agrees. Mickey and Miss Fujikawa walk off, ready to settle problems.</p><p>Sometime later, the two finish their conversation, bowing to one another when finished. Miss Fujikawa, Delilah, and the other gun-weilding men soon disappear, even without taking Hollow. Spider-Woman asks Mickey what she said to Fujikawa to make her go away. Mickey responds by saying it's all done. She made their problems go away ... but that answer isn't good for Spider-Woman. She pressures Mickey into spilling the details about the deal she made with her, but Mickey angrily starts yelling at Mattie. Mickey was the one who cleaned up Spider-Woman's mess. Mickey looks around her and roars at Spider-Woman, Darkhawk and Ricochet. They're at a hospital. They're no longer super heroes. This whole thing would have spun out of control; people would've gotten hurt. But she settled the matter for now; she isn't happy about it, but she made the best of a situation that they should never have been with. Mickey ends her tirade by saying if they aren't happy with that, they should feel free to leave. Darkhawk attempts to comfort Mickey, but she rejects him.</p><p>(Phil Urich's apartment - Sometime later)</p><p>Excelsior's lives have a habit of losing control, and Phil hates it. He walks around his apartment, to where Hollow is sleeping on the living room floor. As he covers her with a blanket, Phil accepts that even though he hates losing control, he knows that life goes on - and they have to move on. He does know that losing control has a way of showing everyone's insecurities; but no matter what, whenever he looks in the mirror, he's forced to confront the demons lurking within. Whether it's the pain of regret (a scene cuts to a lonely Mickey in her bed), the need for vengeance (Mattie sits by herself at a bar), the guilt that eats them up inside (Johnny in his apartment, holding his Ricochet outfit), the secrets they run from (Julie, in a swirl of rainbow light escapes the hospital), the anger they hide (Chris, pouding against a wall) or the pasts they deny (Phil stares at the spirit of the Green Goblin, in the mirror). Phil understands that some of them are just better at locking away their true natures.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage of the movie poster for <em>Weird Science</em><strong>.</strong></li></ul>",

Little do they know that they are being watched.</p><p>Back at headquarters, Talisman continues to let out her rage at Michael Pointer over the death of her father and Alpha Flight. He sits imobolized without saying a word. She lets out her powers in anger over the idea of Pointer being the new Guardian. Agent Brown tries explaining again that Pointer wasn't to blame. He was being used by the Collective and is as much a victim as everyone else. He also needs the suit to help control the power that is left and Omega Flight needs a Guardian. Talisman raises her hand to Pointer's face as her power builds up. With tears in his eyes, Pointer begs her to go ahead and do it. This makes her hestitate. She then questions having an American wearing the Guardian suit. Agent Brown explains that Alpha Flight wasn't about being Canadian but rather serving Canada. They are interrupted by a news report of the Wrecking Crew's rampage as Talisman is about to leave to find Sasquatch. They can see on the television that he is beaten and bound by the Wrecking Crew. They prepare to go to his rescue but USAgent refuses to have Pointer go with them. He doesn't want an untrained rookie watching his back. Talisman also says she will not work with her father's murderer. Michael Pointer is left alone.</p><p>The Wrecking Crew have found the doorway to another dimension. They seek the power that is said to be within. They are met by a giant demon that congratulates them on their destruction. He and his demons plan to devour the Earth. The man following them reveals himself and transforms into Beta Ray Bill. He begins to fight the Wrecking Crew. Fighting both the Wrecking Crew and the demons proves to be too much as Beta Ray Bill lets off a powerful blast. He falls and smashes into the ground. Wrecker takes advantage of Beta Ray Bill's weaken state and prepares to continue to beat him.</p>",

But while recovering, Abbey disappears from DG HQ and tracks down her assailant - and makes a startling discovery!</p><p>The President lands in Africa. Right away he finds himself face to face with a lion. Grabbing a branch from a nearby tree, he prepares to defend himself as it lunges towards him. In mid-leap, it is shot with a high powered tranquilizer dart. The President is now facing Arthur Franco. Franco is surprised he is recognized and has his men grab the President. The President tells Franco now he has to turn over the Master Key as per their agreement. He says he is the only one Franco wants dead. Franco asks why would he bother turning it over. He agrees that he does want the President dead and grabs the dart from the lion and sticks in the President's shoulder.</p><p>On the Danger Yacht, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17826\" href=\"/silicon-valerie/4005-17826/\" slug=\"silicon-valerie\">Silicon Valerie</a> goes to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17807\" href=\"/deuce/4005-17807/\" slug=\"deuce\">Deuce</a> with the possibility that Franco may be scamming them. Deuce asks how that could be if he's already set off two nuclear weapons. Valerie brings up some files that Abbey was able to send them from Franco's computer. There was some information on three different men. One was an engineer on the Russian submarine that exploded and the second was a technician for the convoy in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55779\" href=\"/nevada/4020-55779/\" slug=\"nevada\">Nevada</a>. It doesn't appear that Franco actually has the Master Key, just men in the right places to set the nukes off. Val asks Deuce if he's going to send Abbey and Sydney to rescue the President now that the threat has been diminished. He says no. Their priority is to find the third man first.</p><p>In <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56672\" href=\"/florence-italy/4020-56672/\" slug=\"florence-italy\">Florence</a>, Italy, Abbey and Sydney are waiting for more precise information from Val to locate the third man. Sydney heads off to grab some food. At the cafe, she finds the third man eating at the counter. When she orders him to sit still, he pulls out an Uzi and begins shooting. Sydney brings him and the fight outside (through the front window) as Abbey turns the corner after hearing the shots.</p><p>After a brief firefight, they are able to wound the man. He moves towards the overpass and threatens to jump if they get any closer to him. He then admits that he doesn't want to die. He was under the impression that they were sent to kill him when he didn't show up for the job he was paid to do. Abbey asks if he'll help them find Arthur Franco but he's never heard of Franco. When he's finally about to reveal the name, he is shot by the mysterious sniper.</p><p>This time, they are able to follow the sniper, a woman on a motorcycle. They commandeer a sports car and go into pursuit. They are able to cause the motorcycle to crash but the sniper jumps from the wreckage just at the right moment. She runs off into an alley. When Abbey and Sydney follow, they find the alley full of armed men. The sniper now demands to know who was the man they were chasing. Abbey asks says she should tell them since she shot him. The sniper says she wasn't aiming for him.</p><p>In Africa, Franco continues to hit the President, who is chained to a chair. He begins to go into how he's not a bad man. Using the Master Key will force every nation to dismantle their nuclear weapons. He says that all the nations will follow once the President of the United States starts doing it. The President laughs at the idea that he will cooperate for Franco. With this, Franco seems okay to add one more death to the thousands that have already died.</p><p>As Franco leaves, one of him men approaches the President with a mini-chainsaw. As he swings at the President, he lifts his arm and the chain is broken by the chainsaw. He frees himself as the man faces a gruesome death by his own weapon. More men come running and the President easily takes them out. He then removes a mask of the President's face, revealing he was <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17806\" href=\"/secret-agent-zero/4005-17806/\" slug=\"secret-agent-zero\">not who he seemed to be</a>. Franco will be in for a surprise.</p>",

He is hoping for a higher pay rate becaues Aunt May needs to pay her electric bill. Obviously Jameson refuses.</p><p>The next day at the Baxter Building, Sue is upset at Jameson's editorial about Spider-Man being a menace. He claimed that Spider-Man was working with Gomdulla. She is the only one in the Fantastic Four that is concerned about the lie. Johnny claims that if it's printed it must be true. Sue pulls out another printed item, an invoice from Machismo Motors where Johnny used their funds for a car customization. She plans on going to the bank to cancel the payment.</p><p>At the bank, Peter is also there hoping to deposit his payment to pay Aunt May's electric bill on time. Suddenly, Electro barges in demanding all the money. Peter goes to change into Spider-Man and on the other side of the bank, Sue turns invisible to sneak up on Electro. As Electro talks on and on, Spider-Man crawls on the roof to get nearer and Sue picks up a brick from Electro's destruction and gets ready to hit him with it. Spider-Man jumps down and gets ready to hit Electro. He is unaware that the invisible Sue is standing in between them. He swings to punch but hit Sue instead. As she lies on the floor, unconscious, the rest of the Fantastic Four arrive.</p><p>The Fantastic Four are not happy. When Sue mumbles that Spider-Man hit her before she passes out again, Reed punches Spider-Man out of the bank. Electro, hiding in the bank, zaps the Thing from behind. Thinking its a \"sneak attack, Ben and the Human Torch follow him out. Cars are swung at him and fire is shot. When Ben tries to punch Spider-Man and misses, the bank wall starts to crumble. Ben tries to hold it up and Spider-Man helps by webbing it. Ben rethinks his and Johnny's actions since Spider-Man helped and keeps saying hitting Sue was an accident.</p><p>Electro, hiding in the bank, zaps Johnny. Thinking it's another sneak attack from Spider-Man, the fight begins again. Ben tries stopping him but he shoots a blast of fire and singes Spider-Man in the wrist. Now Spider-Man is upset and bounds Johnny to a fire hydrant. As the Thing approaches him, Spider-Man rips off a car door and hits Ben with it. Ben tries to hit him but instead hits an invisible force field. Sue has recovered. With everything cleared up, they go after Electro.</p><p>Sue promises to put out a press release how Spider-Man helped them against Electro and the mummy. Peter Parker heads home to find that the electric has been shut off. He did not make the payment since he was busy fighting Electro.</p><p><b>Scorpion in...Namesake</b></p><p><i>this story takes place before Civil War</i></p><p>Mac Gargon, Venom, sees that someone new is using the name, Scorpion. Not happy with that, he arranges a meet with her. He begins to attack her. When she gets caught in his webs, it appears that she is caught. She gets a big power surge and blasts Venom. Venom's webbing is a natural formation from the toxic symbiote and Scorpion's power is to absorb toxins.</p><p>Having Venom on the ropes, he takes off. Scopion has been able to live up to her namesake.</p><p><b>What If Spider-Man Joined the Fantastic Four?</b></p><p><i>reprint from What If #1</i></p><p>Uatu tells us about the reality where Spider-Man joined the Fantastic Four after their first meeting. Spider-Man was hoping to join their team in order to make some money. After finding out they were a non-profit organization, Spider-Man leaves. Sue is able to convince him to come back and Reed says they could probably work something out. He reveals his identity to them and later they have a press conference announcing the Fantastic Five.</p><p>They have many successful missions but soon the Sub-mariner enters the scene. Using a hypno-fish, he is able to place Sue under his spell. They leave for his undersea domain. It turns out that the Puppet Master has been controling Namor. He sets the next part of his plan to destroy the Fantastic Five in motion. Soon the rest of the team head toward the sea to confront Namor.</p><p>The fight goes on and on. Puppet Master tires of its lenght and commands Namor to finish them instead of holding back. Namor is able to break free just as a giant squid attacks the Puppet Master's submarine. The Fantastic Five and the Sub-Mariner are not finished. Sue, in tears, stops them from continuing. She says she is the only one that can settle things once and for all. She says she loves both Reed and Namor in different ways. The Fantastic Five do not need here since they have Spider-Man. She chooses to go with Namor. Namor reveals that he has a machine that will allow Sue to be transformed so she can survive in the sea. When she is transformed, she finds that she is choking. Namor did not consider that she would not be able to breath air anymore. He takes her away into the ocean.</p><p>The Fantastic Four leave. Even though he is saddened over losing his love, he knows that Sue will be able to calm Namor's temper against the surface world. Spider-Man blames himself for Sue's decision. Johnny tells him it's not his fault. He says it probably comes down to fate.</p><p><b>Spider-Man J: The Bigger They Are</b></p><p>As Peter is with his Aunt May, they run into his friend, the Detective. The Detective is soon kidnapped by a giant enemy named B-Warrior Tough Goraias in order to lure Spider-Man J. Rather than grabbing the Detective, he accidentally grabs Aunt May.

Sue decides to go to the Baxter Building to makes sure Franklin, Valeria, and Alicia are safe. Ben is happy to have something to hit finally. One of the bugs sends out a shockwave that knocks them off their feet. Spider-Man is bummed that his \"4\" chest-piece is broken already. Johnny jokes that he shouldn't worry since it's the one that they let Franklin play with. Another bug spits out some green goo at them which Spider-Man manages to dodge. Johnny turns up the heat which causes it to harden. This allows Ben to smash out of the hardened goo. Just as he gets free, he is knocked off his feet by another bug. Spider-Man webs him to keep him from falling off the building. He pulls him back so he can land on one of the bugs. The first one is about to blast them again when Johnny fires some flames at it. Now it's Spidey's turn to get gooed.</p><p>Back at the Baxter Building, Sue discovers that the bugs are also attacking the mountains of Transia. She's not sure why until she remembers that the High Evolutionary lives there. She tries to contact him to see if he could help but there is no answer from him or his Beast Men. She decides that it would be best if they went there in person.</p><p>The fight continues as the Human Torch, Thing, and Spider-Man all find themselves falling over the edge of the building with a giant bug. They try to climb to the top of the bug before they land. There is a big BOOM with a cloud of dust upon impact. The three heroes were saved by Sue in a Fantiscar right before impact. Ben tries telling her they were winning but she says that the aliens have already won. They need to save the planet. They are now on their way to Wundagore Mountain.</p><p>On top of the mountain, the Knights of Wundagore are fighting some alien converted humans. The Fantastic Four help them at the cost of losing the Fantasicar. With the invaders defeated, they enter the home of the High Evolutionary. He is not there but has left a device that may be of help. The Knights are unsure how to use it. They turn to Spider-Man for his scientific knowledge. He jokes about how to turn it on but has another idea that Ben and Johnny don't like. Since they are so close to Latveria, Spider-Man thought they should seek Dr. Doom's help in saving the world.</p><p>In Latveria, Dr. Doom is blasting away at the aliens. When he sees the Fantastic Four arrive, he assumes they are trying to attack him when he is busy. They quickly subdue him and explain that they are trying to defeat the aliens. When it's mentioned that even Reed wasn't sure how to stop the aliens, this is all Doom needs to hear to motivate him to solve the problem.</p><p>Doom analyzes the Evolutionary's device and is impressed with its simplicity. He puts the device in a rifle-like housing that can be used to fight the aliens. He will attempt to duplicate the device on a larger scale so that it can be used with his satellites on a larger scale. He states that his reasons for helping is because he does not believe the world's destiny should be decided by aliens but rather himself.</p><p>Reed continues his search throughout space to find an answer to save Earth. The Fantastic Four track down the Imperator as he is in the process of converting more humans. They use their device to stop the change. The Imperator is shocked that the process has been stopped. He says they do not realize what is at stake. He readies to set of a defense protocol. Ben tells Spider-Man to get ready because something is about to happen. Sue sees that something has already happened. Spider-Man is bent over having vomited something strange...</p>",

Will Frank make it back to Snap City? Or will he settle into a new world and just try to make the best of it?</em></p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p>Madman continues his journey back to the land of the living. He was lead to believe that he was the only person alive and his entire life was a fabrication in his mind. It turned out that his enemy, the former head of the Tri-Eye Agency, Mr. Monstadt was behind it. Madman now finds himself with a guide, the comic book hero from his childhood, Mr. Excitement.</p><p>Mr. Excitement tries to get Madman to follow him through the pages of a comic book. He tells him he needs to reconnect with his body as soon as possible. Madman is reluctant to simply follow him blindly, not knowing if this is more delusions in his mind. He knows that Mr. Excitement can't be real. Excitement tells him that he isn't real. He is a \"technological rescue beacon.\" Madman is still hesitant. Mr. Excitement mentions Frank's girlfriend, Joe, and the fact that he'll never see her again if he doesn't get a move on. Everyone in the real world believes that Frank is dead.</p><p>They begin to travel through the \"pages,\" taking on different images (a homage to several famous artists and cartoonists). Mr. Excitement tells Frank that when he reconnects with his physical body, he will be able to distinguish between his real memories and the false ones. They have to travel through all his false personas in order to learn what is real.</p><p>Meanwhile...back in Dr. Flem's lab, they begin to accept that Frank is dead. He apologizes to Joe that he wasn't able to do more. His last resort was to hook up Astroman, who shared Frank's brain patterns, to his body in the hopes of bringing him back. It seems that the astral shock was too much for Astroman's programming. Dr. Flem says that is fitting that they bury them together. The plan is to launch the two of them out into space. Joe's final words are that she will always love him.</p><p>Frank is beginning to understand his journey. He knows that if he can gain confidence in who is as and who he's been since he was reborn, whoever he was before won't matter. Mr. Excitement tells him that he shouldn't try to grasp the pieces of his past life since he is no longer connected to that life. He says it is best to simply move forward. Mr. Excitement tells Frank that his ability to touch others' mind has also altered his own memories. He mentions the \"bad guy\" that Frank fought and pulled an eye out. He says that he really made the guy think his eye was removed. As it turned out, Frank also convinced himself that he actually did it in order to serve as penance for what he may have done in the past.</p><p>Frank finally realizes who Mr. Excitement really is. Since he's a \"digital imprint\" of Frank, he knows that it must be Astroman. He is beginning to accept the truth and is letting go of the guilt.</p><p>They are close to the end of the journey. Frank says thanks to Astroman, in case something goes wrong. They both awake to find that they are no longer on Earth...</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Another offering from Marvel Knights. Guest-starring Dr. Strange!!</p><p>His time is short and getting shorter. Like a fish swimming upstream, the Silver Surfer is drawn to the familiar waters that birthed him. But the path to Zenn-La is neither clean nor straight. To reach his destination, the Surfer must travel through a battlefield of unimaginable scale, and cut to the heart of a Sacred War that has raged for untold eons. Is there time for one last stab at redemption?</p><p>Before leaving Earth, the Silver Surfer was met by Stephen Strange. He told Norrin that he, along with many other great minds (heroes and villains alike) had heard of his condition and had struggled to find a cure. Unfortunately none had been found. All Strange could give the Surfer was a special flame. One that contained all the knowledge on the planet Earth. It was split in two parts, one that held the knowledge before the arrival of the Surfer, and the other had all the knowledge created after his arrival, after he had saved their world. The Surfer put the flame inside of himself and after one last look around the planet, took off into space.</p><p>Flying amongst the stars, the Surfer was called onto a ship flying nearby two armies waging battle on other ships. Aboard the ship, the Surfer saw two aliens, one from each of the races fighting. They told him the reason they had called him and why they were fighting in the first place. Both races were from planets near each other and had studied one another for many many years. Each thought that when they finally developed the ability to communicate with each other, they'd find that they were the same and worshiped the same god. When they finally met and saw that their gods were different, a war began. They had battled for over 50 generations but since they were so equal, neither could win. These two aliens were the leaders of their people and sat in comfort while their races killed each other, but they had called the Surfer to decide which was right and to destroy the other. Instead, the Silver Surfer flew out into the midst of the battle and destroyed the weaponry on both sides. He then went down to the planets and destroyed all their temples. The aliens put aside their differences and became peaceful, but not before one last act of violence. They killed their leaders who had been relaxing while they had been dying. Instead of putting up new temples, both planets erected monuments to the Silver Surfer.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Sofia and Wondra face off as the New Warriors respond to Tony Stark’s offer of amnesty. But will they accept or reject it? Meanwhile, Detectives Sykes and Givens uncover a shocking mystery about the death of the original New Warriors, and a former member may hold the key. Plus, Wolverine shows up…and he ain’t happy!</p><p>Detectives Sykes and Givens check on the remains of the former New Warriors. Microbe's body is still in the morgue. Namorita's body has been seized by the Atlantean Consulate. Then there's the remains of Night Thrasher. The doctor believes that his body was vaporized in the explosion even though the others did not suffer the same fate. He said it could be due to the fact that he was wearing Vibranium mesh armor. What is odd is his DNA scraps that were found seem to be incomplete. He says it puts the body in the sixty-five percentage range. His opinion is that it is the remains of Night Thrasher but isn't completely convinced.</p><p>Elsewhere, a new team is fighting against Nimrod. It turns out to be a training session for the New Warriors. They have converted Arcade's Murderworld into their headquarters. Jubilee, under the guise of Wondra, tells the team how horribly they did. They need to work together and be careful with their own powers so that they do not harm their teammates.</p><p>Outside Stark Tower, Tony and Ms. Marvel are going to check out the response from the offer he made to the New Warriors in joining the Initiative. It's basically a dis against Stark, SHIELD, and the Initiative in big letters along the side of the tower.</p><p>Back at the former Murderworld, Jubilee talks with Sofia. She wants to know if Sofia's made her decision in joining the Warriors yet. Sofia ends up laughing at Jubilee. Jubilee has changed so much and has lost the free spirit nature she used to have. She is fairly certain that she'd rather stay being a waitress than to change so completely. She leaves Jubilee with a thought about whether or not she can trust Night Thrasher.</p><p>In another part of the city, Detectives Sykes and Givens pay a visit to Donyell Taylor, Night Thrasher's brother. Donyell lost his legs in a car accident and no longer plays the part of a hero. He tells the detectives that he's been rebuilding the Taylor Foundation and providing disaster relief to the families in Stamford. They ask him when he last saw his brother. Donyell tells them it was at his funeral. The detectives continue to express their suspicions on the return of Night Thrasher. They tell him that they will be searching for evidence and if they find anything to link him, they will bring down the Foundation. Donyell then tells them that he did receive a call a couple months ago asking for money from one of the offshore accounts. The caller used an electronic voice scrambler. He assumed it was simple extortion and refused. The money was somehow taken regardless. The only people that knew the access codes were himself and Dwayne.</p><p>Jubilee and Beak (Blackwing) are working on sealing off parts of their base in the surrounding tunnels. Jubilee now seems to have some doubts about Night Thrasher. She mentions that they haven't seen him without his mask. Beak says he's probably scarred like Dr. Doom after the explosion. He says it doesn't really matter who he is since he's the one that's given them a chance to still be heroes.</p><p>Suddenly Wolverine appears. Jubilee is mad at the way he left her, on the verge of dying (after an encounter with Omega Red). Logan tells her he did what he did to save her. He's there to tell her that things are different in the world now. It's not like the old days. He says she should be careful in trying to replace what \"nature\" gave her. He understands what it's like to lose something from when Magneto ripped out his Adamantium.</p><p>The detectives have the voice recording of from Donyell with the tapes from the New Warriors reality show. Using Starktech, the voice is matched with ninety-five percent accuracy. Sykes and Givens plan their next move in uncovering the Warriors. They figure that the money is their next lead. It must cost a lot of money to fund a super-team. In the parking garage, they are confronted by someone telling them to stop asking questions about dead people. He sets off a couple smoke bombs in their face. Through the smoke there appears to be a giant-sized Night Thrasher about to crush them.</p><p>Homagecover to the movie \"The Usual Suspect\".</p>",

Dinah is out for vengeance.</p> <p><strong><em>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead</em></strong></p> <p>The issue opens with the police officers telling Black Canary that her that Sin is missing, and tell her that Green Arrow had taken her. Green Arrow tells Black Canary to call Oracle and use her help, but Black Canary tells him to back off, and Black Canary speeds off on her motorcycle. A police officer asks if Sin is Black Canary's daughter, and Speedy says that she's adopted. The police officer then asks if the person who kidnapped Sin could be her birth parent. Green Arrow says they're not, but it certainly does look like they're trying to take Sin back to their custody. Green Arrow then tells Speedy they should check international charter flights and anything at the harbour that's heading for south-east Asia. Green Arrow plans that to get the assassins off Sin's back, they will have to do something long-term - which will mean breaking Dinah's heart again.</p> <p>At night, Black Canary climbs up to Craig's apartment to find him having trouble with locating his passport. Black Canary speaks up and holds a bomb which she discovered under his car. Black Canary interrogates him, wanting a name. Craig tells her that he can't, as that will end up with him being killed. Black Canary asks who that \"he\" is and it snaps to the docks, with someone calling out \"Merlyn!\" At the docks, Merlyn is holding Sin when he realises that his pager is beeping. He sees Craig at his office and wonders why Craig is still alive. Merlyn appears at his office with an arrow pointed towards Craig and asks him why he isn't dead yet. Craig confesses that she would have killed him if she didn't go along with her plan, and Merlyn realises that Black Canary is the room with him. Black Canary shows herself, and Merlyn shoots arrows towards her, but she easily catches them between her hands. Black Canary kicks him down and he defends himself with one of Green Arrow's arrows, threatening her, saying that it's an arrow that will nuke her. Black Canary tells him that it's a geiger counter arrow kicks him out of the window while she holds one arrow in her hand, which releases a parachute. She threatens him to tell her where Sin is, and he says that he's bluffing when Black Canary drops him. He crashes through a skylight and falls into a pool. Black Canary asks if Green Arrow and Speedy have had any luck finding Sin, and they tell her that they find a ship that's making its way to Hong Kong.</p> <p>On the ship, Sin is struggling to get out when the doors flies open with Speedy standing in the door way. Speedy tells her that Sin will have to follow her instructions to escape...</p> <p>Black Canary is chasing down Merlyn and Oracle tells her that they've found the ship Sin's on. To get to her, she'll have to take the Star Bridge, meaning she'll have to let go of Merlyn. Black Canary makes her way to the Star Bridge. Green Arrow is trying to take down some of Merlyn's henchmen when Black Canary rides off the bridge and steers her motorcycle towards the henchmen, with the motorcycle exploding. Speedy is letting Sin onto an escape boat when she tells Sin to hurry up if they want this plan to work. Green Arrow aims for the rope holding the escape boat and it falls, dropping the escape boat down to water and it breaks apart, with Sin's shirt floating amongst the broken boat.</p>",

Oliver Queen learns the sinister secret of the island he's been trapped on... just in time to come face to face with the mastermind behind his plight. And at long last Oliver Queen takes some responsibility for his fate.</em></p><p>Oliver, after shooting down a plane that was shooting at him, finds an opium field, and a pregnant native of the island reveals that a group of people, lead by Chien Na-Wei (China White), are forcing the natives of the island to work in the fields to make heroin. Hackett and Oliver fight in the forest, Ollie getting Hachett in the shoulder, &amp; hand, then a tree falls on him. Oliver gets a compound fracture, and passes out.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The story was originally intended to be 4 issues, hence why issue 1 says \"1 of 4\" on the cover. By the release of issue 3 the series had been extended to 6 issues.</p>",

After everything he's been through, things are about to get worse. Could The Astounding Wolf-Man's career as a crime-fighter be over before it's even truly begun? Also in this issue: WEREWOLF FIGHT!</em></p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p>In the opening of the issue we find Gary, obviously depressed, in what seems to be the wolf lair being built last issue. Suddenly Zechariah appears in a batmobile-esque car with the Wolf-Man insignia on the hood. Gary flips and goes wolf on him because he had been missing for two weeks after Gary killed Sergeant Superior. Zec explained that he knew about it and he explained that it was going to happen, but instead of actually simply warning him he would feel better if Gary experienced it. He didn't know it would be taken that far. He told Gary that even though he controls his wolf form every other day, the first night of a full moon will be as feral as his first transformation retaining only a small bit of Gary's psych. Later that night we find Gary, still worried for unknown reasons, making sure his wife new he loved her and that they'd be ok.</p><p>The next night Gary went out again for the first time in two weeks with Zec. While they were out we see the first glimpses of the Wolf-Mobile's (unofficial name) abilities including some kind of launch pad in the back that flings Gary into the air. He's on the rooftops trying to save a girl from the villain called Thrill Kill. After finding and pursuing him Thrill Kill decides to give Gary a choice and drops the girl forcing Gary to make a choice between defeating him and saving the girl. Thinking quickly Gary lunges at Thrill and fights him in midair, but manages to grab the girl before they hit the ground. When they land the police arrive and start to arrest Gary when the girl stands up for him. Gary then disappears into the night to avoid confrontation. When he gets back to the car he find Zec being held captive by a group of werewolf's who keeping calling Gary an \"Elder Brood\", the wolfs have different color which may be a hint to the name. Gary saves Zec who then disappears with little explanation as to what happened.</p><p>The next day Gary explains to Rebecca that the company he built has decided to fire him and that they may need to lose some household employees and tighten the belt, when suddenly one of the employees pops in and explains that there are men outside who are basically trying to evict him because the house was bought on company money. Gary freaks and apologies to his wife saying \"It's all falling apart.\"</p><p>This issue also contain a larger than ordinary letters column because of fan reaction of the first two issues. The letters column is officially named \"Fang Mail\".</p><p>-A reprint was shipped out on October 17th with a new cover done by Invincible artist Ryan Ottley.-</p>",

Rip, and Booster hop into the time sphere and go after Super Nova,they look at the Superman's death certificate and discover that someone altered his birth parents time line, so that Lionel Luthor would find Kal's ship in Smallville, and that Lex would kill Kal when he found out he was Superman. Booster asks Rip how he can stop this form happening Rip tells him the only way is to talk to who Supernova's talked to. Sure enough he finds himself in Kansas city and meets a man named Jonah Hex. Booster asks him questions and he tells him if he out drinks Jonah than he will answer any questions that Booster has. During that time a young man tries to interrupt Jonah telling him that he has killed his step-brother but Jonah throws a glass at him and he gets knocked out, Michael and Jonah become friends and he agrees to answer his questions. Jonah asks him why he's doing this and Booster says its to help a friend and he has a flashback to infinite crisis where we discover that James Reyes is the Blue Beetle.

            "description": "<p><i>Overview:</i></p><p>Havok and the Starjammers' world is turned upside down as they're forced to help Vulcan in his war against the enemies of the Shi'ar Empire. What horrifying secret of the Scy'ar Tal would make Havok join forces with his brother? And the question isn't IF Vulcan will betray the X-Men... it's WHEN.</p><p><b>Issue Summary:</b></p><p><i>1,000 years ago, the M’Kraan Exodus…</i></p><p>The Eldest recalls how the Shi’ar massacred his people, right in front of his eyes. He ponders that the Scy’ar Tal were a peaceful race, and not prepared for the Avian’s savagery. Those of the Scy’ar Tal who survived the brutalities traveled the spaceways, looking for refuge. The Shi’ar destroyed the Scy’ar Tal’s homeland, their way of life and made claim of the Godstone. And they killed the Eldest’ predecessor.</p><p>The previous Eldest tried his best to reclaim the god in the Crystal, but to no avail. At his old age, the Eldest named his successor while others of their race bowed before him. He told the youngling to take his people’s strength, as he would become the next Eldest.</p><p>However, the current Eldest continues to say, the Shi’ar did not know the nature of his brothers. They have strength together. He thinks that, if the Shi’ar had known the Scy’ar Tal’s resolve, they would have killed them all. The Eldest remembers how he, as a skinny young boy, absorbed the strength of his people and grew into the strong leader he is today. He gathered them around him, proclaiming they had much to do.</p><p><i>Now, aboard the Starjammer…</i></p><p>Havok furiously lashes out at his brother Vulcan, unleashing his powers at full strength at him. However, Vulcan waves his hand forward, hereby creating a protective forcefield around him and the Imperial Guard. Though a difficult feat for Vulcan, he still manages. He compliments Alex on the effort, but mocks the result is the same as always. Powering down for a moment, Havok swears he’ll see his brother dead. Vulcan, on the other hand, asks Alex if he’s sure he wants to see that right there and now. He wants Alex to think carefully before answering if he really wants to rip apart his own ship in a fight he can’t win. Or, Gabriel laughs, does Xavier let any moron lead an X-Men team now?</p><p>Lorna points out to Alex that Vulcan hasn’t attacked, and that the Imperial Guard hasn’t moved a muscle. Gabriel tells Alex to listen to Lorna, and promises he’s only here to talk. Still not convinced yet, Havok asks Rachel what she’s getting. Rachel explains she’s only getting interference, from as well in Vulcan’s mind as in all of the Guard’s. She can get Alex an answer, but in order to do that, she’ll have to kill the telepath known as Oracle.</p><p>Gabriel mocks at how willing Rachel and Havok are to kill. He jokes that Cyclops would be proud of them. But, Gabriel points out, it appears they have a common enemy now: the Scy’ar Tal. He has learned these creatures are after the M’Kraan Crystal, which now belongs to him. Rachel can’t believe Vulcan wants them to help him. She thinks they’d be better off helping the Scy’ar Tal! She remembers how Vulcan killed Banshee, and even tried to kill the Professor! Vulcan even killed Corsair, her grandfather!</p><p>Vulcan admits that, but notes that the Scy’ar Tal have just killed a billion people… <i>his</i>people. Vulcan continues to say there are a lot of things he wants to do right now: kill Havok, find Xavier and kill him… but destroying the universe is not on his list. He asks Rachel if she can say the same thing about the Scy’ar Tal. He asks if she knows what the Scy’ar Tal will do if they get their hands on the Crystal. When Rachel doesn’t answer, Vulcan already thought his “niece” wouldn’t know. These Scy’ar Tal are killing Vulcan’s people and are threatening all of reality. And, Gabriel jokes, the X-Men are the idiots who fight people like that. And he knows the X-Men have dealt with the Crystal before. So, he wants to work together to work on this. He gives Havok 24 hours to decide, and then teleports himself and the Guard away, leaving the Starjammers to ponder their answer.</p><p>Ch’od approaches Havok and places his hand over Alex’ shoulder, assuming aloud that Alex is just lulling Vulcan into a false sense of security. Havok, realizing Ch’od is making fun of him, tells him to shut up.</p><p><i>Later, at the Clench worlds…</i></p><p>The Starjammers have gathered inside a huge headquarters, which is based in a mountainous area, and are joined by Lilandra and Ka’ardum. Presiding over the assembly, Havok discusses what happened with Vulcan and the Guard. Havok thinks Vulcan is desperate. The bottom line, according to Alex, is that he thinks Vulcan must have gotten thrashed by the Scy’ar Tal’s Eldest. Vulcan was hurt. And he also noticed how Gladiator looked; he even had a broken arm. Alex remembers that all of the X-Men combined couldn’t put a scratch on Gladiator.</p><p>Ka’ardum agrees that appealing to your enemies for aid is a weakness in any culture. He explains that the Shi’ar people are ill at ease with Vulcan’s rule and, if they were to learn of this situation, their loyalty would further deteriorate. Raza agrees with that. He noticed the Imperial Guard looked upon Vulcan with murder in their hearts. Rumor has it that Vulcan killed some members of the Guard when he first met them. Havok realizes Vulcan wants to use the Starjammer as a weapon against the Scy’ar Tal and, once they’re dealt with, Vulcan will betray them. “It’s not <i>if</i>,” Alex announces, “it’s<i>when</i>.”</p><p>Lorna becomes angry at this. She knows this is Alex’s brother they are talking about, and that he killed Alex’ father, but she can’t believe that’s it. Their options are to help a murderer, someone who has killed their family and friends, or they can allow an unknown race that could very well be intending genocide to take possession of the M’Kraan Crystal. Havok begins to consider negotiation with the Scy’ar Tal, noting that, if they have a legitimate claim to the Crystal…</p><p>Interrupting, Lilandra angrily shouts out the Scy’ar Tal certainly have no claim to it. She warns Alex he can’t negotiate with these blasphemers. The Crystal <i>must</i> remain in Shi’ar hands, as it is their sacred right. Rachel finds that hard to believe. She knows the Shi’ar are conquerors. She wonders how many other cultures’ holy lands the Shi’ar occupy right now. How many religions has Lilandra crushed? Rachel asks her. What if the Scy’ar Tal’s gods told them that it was <i>their</i> sacred right? Lilandra reminds Rachel she saw what the Scy’ar Tal did. She can’t believe they are considering this. As Lilandra becomes more agitated, her uncle tells her niece to calm herself. He knows Havok was just making a point.</p><p>Havok grows silent for a minute in thought. Finally, he notes aloud that the point is that the Scy’ar Tal took the option off the table when they destroyed Feather’s Edge. As the others listen intently to Alex, Lorna smiles proudly at him. He continues that they have no reason to believe the Scy’ar Tal are going to stop, but they can’t fight them alone. So they take the deal. They help Vulcan destroy the Scy’ar Tal, and then… it’s only a matter of which side kills the other first. And Havok wants to take those odds.</p><p><i>Later that night, at the planet “Standing Still”…</i></p><p>Havok, with only his pants on, stands on the balcony outside his bedroom and gazes upon the landscape below him in thought. Lorna wakes up in the bed behind him, clad only in the sheets of their bed. She asks why Alex can’t sleep, and what he’s thinking about. “The usual,” Alex replies as he turns his attention to her. He’s doubting himself and thinking about what Scott would do, and wonders if his dad is proud of him. Unsure what to say to that, Lorna jokes Alex sure has a bit of self-awareness there.</p><p>Alex jokes back that Lorna isn’t the only one who sees a therapist. He wonders what it is about the two of them. It seems like, no matter where they go or what they do, the two of them always end up in impossible situations. Alex calls himself a simple guy, and yet here he is, forced to help the man who killed his father. As Lorna pulls some sheets around her body and walks over her lover, Alex jokingly remembers when they were just fighting the Sentinels.</p><p>Lorna asks Alex if he figured out what Scott would do, but he doesn’t think that matters anymore. It doesn’t matter what Scott would do, what his father would do, or what the Professor would do. He can’t think like that anymore. He won’t. He knows what to do. Now matter how complicated things get, this can only end one way. Havok powers up one of his arms to make a point. Gabriel is too far gone. Alex realizes the X-Men believe in redemption, but it’s too late for his younger brother. They would have given Gabriel every chance they could, but not after what he has done. Vulcan… has to die. And Alex is pretty sure that’s something Scott couldn’t do. He powers down, and Lorna quietly gives him a hug.</p><p><i>Elsewhere at the dorms…</i></p><p>Rachel is having a nightmare. She remembers when her grandfather John told her it would be a pleasure to teach her how to dance. And only a few moments later, how the Shi’ar Death Commando’s massacred her entire family. The sweat of fear drips all over Rachel’s face, and with a staggering voice apologizes as she never meant for this to happen. Rachel also hears how the Death Commando’s leader, Blackcloak, told her that her family wears Rachel’s genome.</p><p>As Korvus enters Rachel’s bedroom and calls out her name, Rachel wakes up screaming. Korvus knows she was having that dream again. Rachel warns Korvus to stay out of her head, to which Korvus reminds Rachel that she gave him her dream. When he then asks why she is doing this, Rachel turns away and explains she can’t do this right now. She believes what they have is not real. However, that’s not what Korvus meant. He thinks Rachel is becoming consumed with thoughts of revenge. He says that Rachel’s name may as well be Scy’ar Tal. But, he wants Rachel to tell him… if every Shi’ar died today, would that bring her family back? He calls the connection he and Rachel have real. He knows because he feels it not just in his mind, but also in his heart. And he will, until the day that his heart stops beating. He leaves, leaving Rachel very much alone.</p><p><i>The following day…</i></p><p>Aboard Vulcan’s ship, the Starjammers find themselves at the gunpoint of Vulcan’s guards. With his wife and the Imerial Guard standing behind him, Vulcan welcomes the Starjammers to his empire. Leaning downward, Ch’od quietly jokes to Raza that they’re still alive, to which Raza confirms. “Double or nothing?” Ch’od asks his teammate.</p><p>Flanking her husband and emperor, Deathbird believes they are making a mistake. She calls the Starjammers too dangerous and wants to kill them now. However, Vulcan is certain that their new allies will keep their word. Besides, the Chancellor’s Guard will be joining them as well, just in case. Rachel wonders who that Guard could be. On that moment arrives Araki… and the Shi’ar Death Commandos! Rachel and Araki are both as surprised to see one another.</p><p>Marvel Girl becomes incensed, generating a large, blue Phoenix force around her body. She yells “murderers” to the Death Commando’s and Araki, who panics. Immediately, Vulcan’s soldiers are ordered to protect their Chancellor, but they have no time, as Rachel lashes out a blue fireblast against Krait and Offset, shouting that they killed her cousins, aunts and uncles! She gives Blackcloak a powerful punch in the face for killing her grandparents. She then moves over to Araki, with the Phoenix force glaring angry at him in the face. Rachel can see the guilt in Araki’s thoughts. She discovers he runs the Secret Order. It was he who signed her family’s death warrant. She wants to hear Araki say it.</p><p>Suddenly, Lorna attacks Rachel with her telekinetic powers, demanding that she stops immediately. Not waiting, she magnetically rips open the floor and traps Rachel in makeshift bonds. Rachel demands that Lorna lets her go, as these people killed her family. Rachel knows Lorna wasn’t there at the time, so she has no idea what happened. She wants to make them pay.</p><p>Araki begs his Emperor to do something, however Vulcan simply remains in his chair. With a sadistic smile, he apologizes to the Chancellor, claiming he didn’t see this one coming. But frankly, Gabriel admits he is enjoying the show. Alex tells Rachel her revenge will have to wait. Rachel’s eyes glow as she refuses to wait. Alex tries to make Rachel understand they have to deal with the M’Kraan Crystal first. He knows how hard this must be for her, but this situation is bigger than all of them. He reminds Rachel that she is his family now, and he swears to her that once they’re done there, they’ll make them <i>all</i> pay. Together.</p><p>“Soon,” Rachel asks as she hesitantly calms down. “Soon,” Havok promises.</p><p><i>Later…</i></p><p>As they stand in a corner together, Lorna notices to Ch’od how Deathbird is staring at her with a vengeful look in her eyes. When Ch’od jokingly muses that Deathbird might be envying Lorna’s hair, Lorna replies she rather thinks Deathbird is thinking of ways of how to kill her.</p><p>Vulcan and Havok stand on a platform together, overlooking their combined troops: the Starjammers, the Imperial Guard and the Death Commandos. As Major-General Ka’ardum has also joined the party, Gabriel welcomes him and wants to start killing some Scy’ar Tal now. Havok corrects Gabriel that is the wrong way to play this game. He thinks they need to take out the Scy’ar Tal’s weapon first: the weapon called Finality. He opens a projection of the weapon to everyone, and begins the briefing.</p><p>He explains that Ch’od was able to track the energy readings from the first attack and found the source location of the star. Alex thinks that if they want to stop the Scy’ar Tal, <i>this</i> will be the way to do that. They need to send their armada to defend the Crystal and send in a strike team to take out Finality. Gabriel has nothing to add to that plan, and even calls it Havok’s call. Havok wants the Imperial Guard and the Starjammers to go after the weapon. Ka’ardum will lead the fleet to the Crystal. With all this said, Havok concludes that they’ll launch within the hour.</p><p><i>The next hour, outside Shi’ar space.</i></p><p><i>The Imperial Guard ship “Praetorium” and the Starjammer.</i></p><p>Both ships arrive at the same time. Vulcan, with Gladiator standing next to him, asks Raza and Ch’od to report. Raza explains that the Praetorim made the jump with them, and they’ve already made several contacts: they’ve found the Scy’ar Tal. Ch’odd adds the proximity to the gravity field is playing havoc with their sensors.</p><p>Havok looks outside and is surprised as he only expected one opponent. But apparently the Scy’ar Tal aren’t doing this halfway. The troops look outside and find lots of Scy’ar Tal ships gathered around several big stars. Havok thinks it must be a solar nursery. There must be dozens of stars out there, all in one place. And the Scy’ar Tal ships are using them as an ammo depot.</p><p>Lorna panics, but Havok remains calm. However, he does realizes this means the Scy’ar Tal have the means to destroy every planet in the core systems. They could destroy all of… “The Shi’ar Empire,” Gladiator fills in. “My Empire,” Vulcan fears. He then orders Gladiator to prepare the Guard as every Scy’ar Tal there dies. “And that’s just for starters.”</p>",

            "description": "<p> </p><p><em>Black Canary and Green Arrow conclude their mission on Paradise Island and are stunned to find out what's really been going on there — and just who's been behind the kidnapping of their missing friend!</em></p><p>The issue opens with Black Canary accepting Athena’s opportunity to train what they call The Furies. Black Canary gives her thanks, but before she can finish her sentence, she is interrupted with something called “fortitude”. Black Canary is confused. Athena replies that whoever she is training, the trainees must know that their trainer is not teaching them, but they know that they can wield the art of war. Athena calls it the display of fortitude. In an arena, Black Canary is fighting off various Amazons. Speedy, Athena and other Amazons are watching her fight and Speedy asks how long this is going to take until she displays her “fortitude”. Athena replies that it will take as many as it takes. It’s something that is <em>there</em>.</p><p>Elsewhere on Paradise Island, Connor and Oliver are surrounded by Amazons from their previous escape and they both whisper to each other the meaning of “hero” and Oliver tells Connor to do something with his bag of tricks. With that, Connor pulls out a smoke bomb and throws it to the ground, releasing a cloud of smoke which tears the eyes and chokes the Amazons. The both of them make the way to the cliff of the island and make a jump for it, with several spears following them.</p><p>Back at the arena, Black Canary is still fighting for her “fortitude”. Speedy excuses herself and tells Athena she has to make her way to the bathroom. However, Athena refuses her to leave and an Amazon brings out a chamber pot. Speedy begrudgingly says that she’ll pass.</p><p>After Connor and Oliver have jumped off the cliff, they make their way onto the boat. Connor presses a button which releases flares into the air and Speedy alarms Black Canary of it. However, Black Canary says that they’re not leaving just yet, and makes a run towards Athena, putting a sword to her throat and tells them to back off or else she’ll die. Black Canary demands some answers on what’s going on. Through a doorway in the arena, Black Canary asks why Athena had gotten a doppelganger to kill her. Athena replies that it was all for her. She explains that she would’ve never thought of joining the Amazons while Oliver lived.</p><p>Black Canary asks why she didn’t just kill him. Athena replies that the people she worked with forced her to keep him alive. Everyman was to live as Oliver for a month and <em>then</em> kill him and planned to kill Oliver when Black Canary was there. That way, they knew that she would’ve turned her back on men. Black Canary then asks why Everyman didn’t stick to the plan. Athena reveals that when he was put in the position of consummating the marriage, it would be a problem because “Everyman was suffering from the inability to perform… sexually.” Everyman decided that Black Canary would’ve seen through his ruse, if he had denied on consummating the marriage.</p><p>So Everyman panicked and attempted to kill Black Canary, however, Black Canary ended up killing Everyman instead. Athena continues to explain but is cut short when Black Canary and Speedy run off. Desaad then comes out and asks Athena if she will ever learn the <em>whole</em> truth. Athena asks about which part: that they wanted Black Canary training on the island, or that Everyman was supposed to pose as Green Arrow to infiltrate, or that she’s actually Granny Goodness? Granny Goodness adds that they’ll all learn the truth soon. Desaad asks that they’re not really finished with the Arrow Family, and Granny Goodness replies that they aren’t just yet…</p><p>On the shores of Paradise Island, Black Canary and Oliver embrace. Speedy comments on them being quiet nauseating. Connor then accelerates the boat at a blitzing speed and with more of Black Canary and Oliver’s dirty talk, they scare Speedy. Oliver thanks them for saving him and says that he’s glad to be with his family once again, happy and safe. A crack then comes out of the sky and hits Connor right in the heart.</p>",

He tells Earth-19 Batman and Apollo, the Ray of Earth-50, that he still retains his sanity and goes to get help. In the room with the other heroes, the Red Son Superman and Earth-31 continue to fight while talking about the vest that the Earth-22 Blue Beetle made that travels across different universes. Monarch interrupts their conversation to begin the battle between the Starmen. The ape Starman of Earth-17 is instantly vaporized by the Earth-48 Starman. He in turn is decapitated by the Earth-7 Starwoman.</p><p>While this is going on, the Earth-40 vampire-Batman tells Breach to use the completed vest and go get all of the other versions of Captain Atom to help fight Monarch. He disappears and Monarch starts the next fight; the battle between the three Flashes. Johnny Quick of Earth-3 is quickly taken out by Jay Garrick of Earth-2, who tries to think of a way out of Monarch’s game. He is betrayed by the seemingly innocent Lia Nelson of Earth-9, who proceeds to try and kill Jay. She is taken out by Quick with a vibrated fist through the chest, who Jay attempts to incapacitate. Jay falls for the same trick as Lia and Quick is declared as the winner.</p><p>After the fight, the heroes once again try to attack Monarch, but are unsuccessful. Monarch teleports the three Wonder Women for their fight while Quantum Storm and Captain Atom of Earths-37 and 38, respectively, go to help free the heroes who lost their fights, but didn’t make it into Monarch’s army. Back in the arena, and after much punches being thrown, the Wonder Woman of Earth-34 manages to break the neck of the Earth-18 Wonder Woman. The Earth-34 and Earth- 21 Wonder Women square off and after exchanging simultaneous blows, only the Earth-34 Wonder Woman is left standing to be inducted into Monarch’s army.</p><p>Meanwhile, on Earth-13, Birgadier, the husband of Eve of Shadows, is seen being recruited by Breach and several other Captain Atoms to help fight Monarch.</p>",

Also included are preliminaries for his upcoming Storms at Sea storybook, unpublished brush and ink roughs for book illustration assignments, and more—65 pieces of art rendered variously in pencil, Wolff pencil, and brush and ink.</em></p><p><em>The Various Drawings series continues to present Schultz’s otherwise unseen privately commissioned works, and, as usual, includes a spectacular gatefold centerpiece.</em></p>",
