            "description": "<p><i>The conclusion! X-23 and Hellion have stormed the Facility to rescue Mercury. And as if Kimura and a hundred Facility agents wasn't bad enough, something is roaming the halls of the Facility... something designed to feed on mutants. Predator X is on the loose, and nothing will ever be the same for the New X-Men! Part 4 (of 4)!</i></p> <p>X-23 and Hellion encounter a small army and Kimura in their efforts to rescue Mercury. Hellion defeats Kimura but refuses to kill her, insisting to X-23 that they have to be better than their enemies. They are then attacked by several “Predator X” creatures that were created at the request of William Stryker. Stryker learned of a “mutant antichrist” who would turn the tide in mutantkind’s favor. Predator X was developed using Mercury’s skin and designed to feed exclusively on mutant blood. The Predator X creatures quickly overwhelm the two young mutants and things go from bad to worse when a fresh contingent of Facility guards surround them. At that moment, the X-Men and remaining New X-Men arrive with a O<i>N</i>E Sentinel and quickly make short work of the remaining Facility forces. One of the Predator X creatures survives the battle and escapes. Upon their return to the Institute, Mercury reaches out to X-23 for support while Emma Frost deals with the continuing threat of Kimura. She confronts Kimura with her abusive past and the fact that she has becoming the same kind of bullying abuser she who victimized her in her youth. Emma erases Kimura’s memories of her grandmother, the only person who ever showed her any love or kindness. She then sets her on a mission to torment those who ran the Facility, starting with the man who tortured Mercury: Dr. Harkins. With one threat eliminated, another emerges as long-time X-Men ally Amanda Sefton returns to Earth in a blazing ball of fire with an ominous warning.</p>",

He starts to flee, but Spider-Man tells him that if he doesn't go with him, he will die.  Soon in Curt Connors apartment, Spider-Man is checking to see how the individual he brought is doing.  Curt says he is close to finding an antidote that could reverse the transformations.  Curt also asks if there's anything he can do for his aunt.  Spider-Man pauses for a few seconds and tells him to pray.</p><p><em>The present</em></p><p>At a police station, a Detective Jonas Fogg is talking with his partner, Silas about the recent events.  It seems that Spider-Man has brought in several individuals in variations of his costume to them.  Curt Connors arrives with an antidote.  Curt tells them that the formula used on them is similar to the one he used that transformed him into the Lizard.  The different spidermens decide that maybe they don't want to be \"saved.\"  Before they were just homeless kids.  No one cared about them.  Now they had power and a chance to be something.  Curt tells them they have a choice about the administration of the antidote: a needle or dart gun.</p><p>In a hidden lair, another young individual is locked in a room.  He has no idea why he is there.  He simply wants to get out.  He is being watched by Calvin Zabo.  He says, to himself, that the young man is there because he is just like Peter Parker and therefore is the ideal control subject.</p><p>Peter meets with Reed Richards.  It seems the individual that was brought to him is alive and stable.  He also used the formula that Curt developed (even though he says he could've made his own).  Upon examining the boy, he found a tracker imbeded under his skin.  Reed believes that all the individuals most likely have one too.  Peter says he could use it.  He thinks to himself that he could reverse the signal and home in on it.  As he's about to leave, Reed tells him that he doesn't have to feel alone in everything he's going through.  Peter says that if he is, it's because of him and Tony Stark.</p><p>Below Manhattan, Spider-Man is on the verge of tracking down the location from the tracer.  Zabo is recording a journal discussing his current studies.  He is trying to figure out why a teenage Peter Parker, upon gaining super powers, used them for good rather than personal gain.  This has been the reason behind all his test subjects.  The idea was to have them out for a week then he would gather them up.  On one of his security cameras, he sees that Spider-Man has arrived.  Taking a formula that lies close by, Zabo says he is going to turn things over to his \"associate,\" Mr. Hyde.</p>",

And what does Bruce have hidden away that's so vital?</p><p>Will Magnus is able to track down his Metal Men.  He is horrified to find the security guards dead.  Hoping that they weren't responsible, he discovers that it was, in fact, Brainiac in an OMAC body.<br /></p><p>At the hospital, Bruce is recovering.  Clark asks him why did he hold onto the Brother Eye and OMAC technology.  His answers is basically for the same reason he keeps a giant penny or old costumes in the Batcave.  He says orphans are collectors, they have a hard time giving things up.  Lucius arrives to tell Bruce that Magnus has gone missing.  Bruce tells Lucius to get a prototype device from R &amp; D and to give it to Clark.  It is a device that will track the OMAC prototype.<br /></p><p>Superman is able to easily track the prototype with the device.  Inside, Magnus is still talking to Brainiac.  It seems he wants to use the OMAC virus to infect everyone in order to control them.  He needs to test his virus on a human test subject.  He turns to Magnus' assistant, Helen, and Will insists Brainiac use him instead.  Brainiac says he may need Magnus in the future.  Superman arrives and gets their attention.  He soon begins fighting the Metal Men.</p><p>Back at the hospital, Bruce barely manages to crawl out of bed.  He tells himself that he will clean up this mess, even if it kills him.</p><p>The Metal Men do not want to hurt Superman but they have no choice.  They are able to defeat him when Tin reveals that he has a piece of Kryptonite that Brainiac took from Metallo.  Brainiac doesn't want Superman dead at this point.  His plans are to eventually create a variant of the OMAC virus that could infect a Kryptonian.  Superman refuses to give up fighting.  Brainiac then asks who would like the honor of killing him.  Magnus' assistant, just transformed into an OMAC herself, volunteers.</p><p>Outside, Batman arrives and talks to Will.  They are discussing a way to shut down Brainiac.  As Helen/OMAC fights Superman, Batman jumps in and tells the Metal Men to fight Brainiac's programming.  He tells them to prove that they want acceptance in the world.  Struggling, they managed to get their will back.  They turn to Brainiac and begin fighting him.  Will comes in with a very large gun.  He shoots Helen in the neck with a dart that is to give her control over herself.  Helen starts fighting Brainiac too.  Finally, with the power of an OMAC and the Metal Men, Brainiac is defeated.  Brainiac has managed to escape with his consciousness out of the OMAC body.</p><p>Superman melts down the OMAC exoskeletons.  He asks Bruce if he has any other prototypes hidden anywhere.    Bruce says no.  Bruce says it's the best thing to do.  Clark asks then why didn't he destroy it months ago.  Bruce says it's because of the penny thing.  What it comes down to, he wanted there to be something that could protect the world if the metahumans ever went out of control.  Clark then asks why would he let him destroy it.  Bruce asks Clark, when has he known him to just have one contingency plan.</p>",
