            "description": "<p><em>What do Art Adams, Joe Kubert, Pete Woods, Rags Morales, Kevin Maguire and Eric Wight have in common? No, they're not the latest rogues in Superman's gallery! Rather, they're just some of the talents DC has assembled to deliver ACTION COMICS ANNUAL #10, the place to catch up on all that's new to Superman's world - and to catch a glimpse of things to come in future issues of ACTION!</em></p><p>Lex Luthor is exploring through the jungle thinking about the different ways he could <i>kill</i> Superman. The idea that most intrigues Lex is death by Kryptonite. To him, that would be the most ironic way.</p><p>Young Clark must live his life carefully. He cannot play games such as baseball out of fear of hurting his friends. On his way home, he sees a rocket speeding towards Earth. He flies up to attempt to stop it. On the ground, a slightly older boy emerges speaking Kryptonese. He says, \"son of Jor-El.\" He has no other memories.</p><p>At the Kent farm, Clark brings the boy into the storm cellar where all of Clark's Kryptonian artifacts are. The boy sees a flag with an S-shaped symbol that he recognizes as the symbol for the House of El. The two believe that the boy must also be from Krypton. They decide that his name should end in \"El.\" The boy takes \"Mon\" as the first part, seeing it on a calendar. Thus, he is now known as Mon-El.</p><p>Clark and Mon-El secretly prevent accidents to save lives. Clark even gets to play \"baseball.\"</p><p>Having nightmares, Mon-El is haunted by a phrase, \"You don't belong here...\" Determined to discover whether or not he truly is Kryptonian, they go into storm cellar to see if Kryptonite has the same deadly affect on Mon-El as it does for Clark. As soon as Clark removes the lead box containing it, Mon-El becomes deathly ill.</p><p>He now remembers that his name is Lar Gand and that he is from the planet Daxam. Lead is extremely poisonous to his people. There is no cure. Mon-El figures that being sent Lar to the Phantom Zone, where time stands still, is the only way he can survive.</p><p>Clark is left \"alone\" again.</p><p>Thanagarians investigate why three of their police cruiser have become lost in a certain sector. They are greeted by three Bizarros who only have one word to say to them, \"Hello.\"</p><p>A two page spread showing the different parts of Superman's Fortress.</p><p>Jor-El and his mentor Non discover that Krypton is doomed to explode. The Science Council refuses to hear of it. General Zod and his troops take them away on charges of heresy. They are given a warning by the council and told that their discussion on the destruction of Krypton was forbidden.</p><p>Jor-El works secretly on a rocket as Non speaks to the people. General Zod begins to believe the word of Non. Non is soon taken away in the night. Missing for two days, he was found outside of the city with a fresh scar on his head. His intellect had been taken away.</p><p>Outrage, Zod speaks to Jor-El and demands that they destroy the Council. Refusing to believe that violence is the answer, Jor-El doesn't take part in the attack. Defeated, Zod, his lieutenant Ursa, and Non are captured. Jor-El steps in and rather than have them sentenced to death, ensures that they are placed in the Phantom Zone, where they still will have a chance at life.</p><p>Zod vows that he will return to rule and will make Jor-El his slave as he is a slave to the Council. Jor-El will bow before him as will his son, Kal-El. Jor-El disagrees.</p><p>Luthor is discussing the different affects the different types of Kryptonite have on Superman. He discusses green, red, blue, and gold. Not being able to decide on which should be used to kill Superman, Lex uses all four to give Metallo and upgrade. This marks the beginning of Lex's Revenge Squad.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage to the cover of <em><a href=\"/superman-annual-1/4000-4652/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-4652\">Superman Annual #1</a></em>.</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Best-selling author Brad Meltzer and superstar artist Ed Benes bring you the final chapter of \"The Lightning Saga,\" as the villains are revealed!</p><p>(<b>Five Minutes Until Impact)</b> It is a free-for-all brawl between the current members of the Justice League of America, The Justice Society of America, the time-traveling members of the Legion of Superheroes, and a giant, green tentacle monster. Members of both the JLA and the JSA with heightened senses know something is amiss. While they can see and feel the enemy that they are fighting as well as the Legion members, they sense nothing there. Using his enhanced vision superman hones in on Sensor Girl's ware-abouts--and he is angry. Flying like a blur through the sky over the battle he rushes and grabs his former teammate. Sensor Girl winces in pain and tells Clark that he shattered her shoulder, despite a worried Superman having barely touched her. Power Girl looks deeper and reminds Clark not to trust his eyes, but to use his senses. Superman has been fooled yet again by Sensor Girl.</p><p>(<b>Four Minutes Until Impact</b>) The real members of the Legion of Superheroes are currently stationed at specific points in various cities around the world: Tokyo, Central City, Smallville, San Francisco, Gotham City, and Keystone City. (<b>Three Minutes Until Impact</b>) Jay Garrick arrives at Keystone city to talk to Dream Girl. He realizes that she has been lying all along about not being able to see the future, and attempts to talk her out of whatever she is planning on attempting. She says that his being there is not important if her real job is to stall the only one fast enough to stop everything from happening. Jay calls her bluff and assures her that he is not the fastest member on the team as Power Girl, Green Lantern, Red Tornado, and Superman arrive simultaneously at the locations of other Legion members. (<b>Two Minutes Until Impact</b>) Ensuring that he is not tricked again, Superman scans across the entire spectrum to verify that Sensor Girl is actually in front of him, but is only truly convinced when he smells the salt in her tears. Then Superman notices the lightning rod in her hand. She informs Black Canary that the Legion members are planning on sacrificing one of themselves to bring back one of their members.</p><p>(<b>One Minute Until Impact</b>) Batman and Mr. Terrific arrive in Gotham City. Batman explains the technology to Mr. Terrific, and Terrific asks what right they have to stop the event before them. Batman likens it to suicide and the two are off. (<b>Forty-two Seconds Until Impact</b>) Around the globe members of the JSA and JLA reach out to the Legion Members asking them to step down. As everyone reaches out to stop them the Legion Members activate the force-fields in their flight rings. (<b>Fourteen Seconds Until Impact</b>) Black Canary activates a device that Batman and Mr. Terrific designed to negate the force-fields (Batman learned about this when he was originally studying the flight rings). The fields buckle for a moment, then repair themselves. Not only had Brainiac 5 designed the force-fields to be impenetrable by the current teams, but they are also self-repairing.</p><p>Each member of the Legion prepares themselves for the possible oblivion that awaits them. Only Karate Kid remains without his shield up. (<b>Impact</b>) With his lightening rod aimed to the sky, lightening pours over his body. The other legion members begin to fade away before the eyes of the JLA and the JSA. Karate Kid had brought back not only Wally West, but his wife and children as well. Still alive, Karate Kid begins to fade away as well. Starman gives his ring to Mr. Terrific because he doesn't want to fade away with the others. In The Fortress all of the members exit this time period through their portals except Karate Kid who is told that he cannot go back: his mission is only beginning. The two teams are pleased to have Wally back, and in the future Brainiac is pleased that they brought back who they wanted.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Jodi Picoult's sensational run reaches its gut-wrenching finale! Amid a war between the United States and the Amazons on American soil, Wonder Woman must race to save Paradise Island from total ruin! But the traumatic repercussions of her decision to slay Max Lord bring the Amazon princess full circle, as she realizes there's only one way to stop the war. Can Wonder Woman cross that line once more, or will lives continue to be lost? </p><p>Wonder Woman continues to ponder over who she is now.  The war on humans by the Amazons continues in Washington, D.C.  They press their attack against Diana (and Nemesis).  During the battle, Diana sees an billboard ad for a soda that says to \"Live Life.\"  She finds this odd yet now questions her actions her entire life.  She has always done what her mother taught her, what she believed was right.  She wonders if that makes her a hero or a robot.</p><p>Wonder Woman now has a new resolve.  She begins to fight as she hasn't fought before.  She now feels alive for the first time.  She easily repels the attacks of spears aimed towards them and takes out the attackers.  She faces her mother, Hippolyta and tells her they need to talk.  Hippolyta says the humans will lose the war.  Diana says that since her mother started it, the only way she can end it is by taking the throne away from her.  Outraged, Hippolyta strikes Diana for speaking to her so.<br /></p><p>Nemesis is left falling off a building and Wonder Woman must save him.  She flies him over to where Batman and Black Canary are.  Nemesis tells her about Everyman impersonating Sarge Steel and how a nuke is aimed at the portal to Themyscira.  There is also another weapon the Amazons have. </p><p>Hippolyta and the Amazons attack and they are forced to fight once again.  Hippolyta is about to use the weapon so Nemesis suggests that Wonder Woman throw him at her.  He manages to grab a key off Hippolyta's belt before they go crashing through a window.  Hippolyta is handed the weapon, which is in a box and sticks the key into the slot on top.  The real Hippolyta comes up and orders the \"impostor\" to be stopped.  Nemesis uses the box to strike an Amazon but the box is opened as a result.  Giant killer hornets, native to Themyscira emerge.  Wonder Woman tells Nemesis that one sting can kill you in hours.<br /></p><p>Wonder Woman grabs her mother and tells Nemesis to jump away.  He grabs a banner and plans to capture the hornets.  For his bravery, he is stung a couple times.  Superman and Hal Jordan arrive to incinerate the bugs.  Nemesis lies dying as Wonder Woman goes to his side.  He reveals to her that he figured out she and Agent Prince were the same.  As he fades away, Wonder Woman is filled with anger.  She turns to face her mother once more.<br /></p><p>Hippolyta asks who is she that she would weep over a human and fight her own mother.  Thinking this over and her time with Nemesis, she punches her mother.  She continues her blows saying she'll tell her who she is.</p><p>The Justice League try to fight off the rest of the Amazons but are finding themselves becoming outnumbered.  Superman says he can hear a very faint heartbeat in Nemesis but it is fading.  Batman tries to tend to him when he is attacked from behind.  He manages to get the advantage over his attacker and demands that she save him or she will suffer as she never has before.  The Amazon tells Batman to go ahead and kill her.  The only antidote grows on Themyscira and he only has a few hours to live.</p><p>Away from the others, Wonder Woman says she'll tell her mother exactly who she is.  She is the person she raised her to be and more.  She asks why she cannot accept who she is and who she's become.  Wonder Woman ends up holding a knife to Hippolyta's throat.  She can easily kill her with one twitch of her wrist and end her reign and the war.  She says it won't be that easy.  When she took the life of Max Lord in order to save millions of others, taking one life is too many.  She turns the knife around and offers it to Hippolyta.  She asks if she remembers asking if she would die for the humans she was sent to protect.  She says that she would.  The real question is, will Hippolyta kill her in order to win her war?</p>",

            "description": "<p>On Oa, Guy Gardner is getting a hard time from Salaak for leaving his ring behind on his shore leave. He is sentenced to another year-long ban of vacation. Guy leaves upset and heads for his duties as the graduation day approaches for the new recruits.<br /><br />In a Korugarian alley, Soranik--dressed in disguise--witnesses a knife fight and one of them gets injured. Pulling out her power lantern and calling for them to stop they scurry thinking the Green Lanterns are evil. The one that is wounded doesn't get very far and Soranik begins to use her power ring and medical expertise to heal the wounded stranger. While she's healing him others come to witness this event and are shocked at seeing a Green Lantern using his/her powers for good. It is still instilled in their population that Green Lanterns are evil and corrupt people who use their powers only for evil. Seeing Soranik heal one of their own, a crowd forms and comes to her for healing.<br /><br />Guy is sent on a mission to Clustral to help a sector which is in need of help. An anomolous matter discharge from a white dwarf star has disrupted the orbit environment. It must be stabilized before the localized atmosphere is compromized. Guy learns, upon entering the system, that there are already two other Lanterns on the scene--Tanakata Z and Quond. Guy immediately seeks out their location.<br /><br />Heading to Mogo, Isamot and Vath speak about Isamot's recent actions on his homeworld and his ex-girlfriend. While arriving on the surface of Mogo, Isamot comes across Green Man and is shocked to see another Lantern on the surface. I guess Isamot has never seen Green Man before and meets his acquaintance. <br /><br />Back on Korugar, the lines are long for Soranik's medical treatment. Soranik's ring is running out of power and she out of energy. Soranik calls it quits for the day at the reluctance of the people of Korugar. The police, wondering what all the commotion is, show up and break up the party. They attempt to forcably stop Soranik from helping the bumbs. Just as the shooting begins Soanik is joined by Kilowog and Iolande. Knowing that this is what the Korugarians fear most--an invasion by the Green Lanterns--she tells Kilowog and Iolande to go easy on them. Soranik wants to demonstrate that Lanters protect not injure.<br /><br />Still patching things up in Clustral, Tanakata Z is trying to toughen up Quond by having him defy Guy's orders. Tanakata thinks that he or Quond shouldn't have to follow orders of anyone, especialy Guy's. After Guy straightens them up a little, Tanakata convinces Quond to leave the planet and Guy to finish up by himself.<br /><br />In Oa, Kilowog, Iolande, and Soranik are discussing the political climate of Korugar and how the Lanterns can change their opinion of the Green Lanters and the Green Lantern Corps. Soranik thinks that Iolande is just spouting off at the mouth and doesn't want to take words from a \"rookie\" so her and Iolande get in a shouting match. Kilowog is there to break it up and assigns those two as new partners.</p>",
