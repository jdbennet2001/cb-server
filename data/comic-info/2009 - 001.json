Spider ventures into the dangerous Angels 8 district, home of the Transients —humans who have decided to become aliens through cosmetic surgery.

Could you stand the toil of an average life after years of leaving destruction in your wake? And what if you couldn’t stand it? What would you do then? <br/>INCOGNITO – a twisted mash-up of noir and super-heroics – by best-selling creators Ed Brubaker (The Death of Captain America) and Sean Phillips (Marvel Zombies) with Val Staples on colors. <br/>And continuing Criminal’s single issue tradition, each issue of Incognito has more pages of story content, as well as articles on pulp and noir and behind the scenes looks!<br/><br/></em>Zack Overkill and his twin brother Xander were super-powered mercenaries.  They committed crimes for the money, not concerning themselves with any innocent deaths.  When Xander was killed, Zack testified against his boss and entered the Witness Protection plan.  As part of his parole, Zack must take drugs that suppresses his super powers.  Working as a mail clerk in an office, Zack is bored out of his mind.<br/><br/>When news of a freak tornado hit downtown, Zack knew things weren't as they seemed.  Going to the scene, he recognized the signs of a battle that had been covered up with the explanation of a storm.  He couldn't give in to the feeling of slipping away into a weak individual living a lie.  He decided to take drugs to cope with his mundane life.  A dealer had a drug that would hide the effects of drugs when tested.  Zack decided to float through life and laugh at the idiots.<br/><br/>Laughing to himself on his way to his car one day, a woman on her cell phone assumed he was laughing at her and her convesation.  She told  him off saying he was a loser that thought he was better than everyone.  Zack was pissed since she didn't even know who he was.  To his amazement, he tore off the door to his car.  His powers were back.  It seemed the drug he was taking to cover his use was having a reaction with those the government made him take. <br/><br/>Zack decided to put on a mask and just roam the night.  Coming across a woman getting attacked in an alley, he decided to do something about it.  He didn't care one way or the other for the woman but enjoyed the rush of excitement after taking part in a violent act in putting the guys down.  Zack felt stronger.  He always shared power with his brother.  Now it felt like he had inherited his dead brother's power and had become stronger than ever.  <br/><br/>With this, the scientist responsible for performing the tests on Zack and Xander receives an alarm that \"Project Overkill\" has moved back to active status.",

No big deal, right? Wrong! What starts out as a series of petty squabbles along the lines of a typical episode of The Real World quickly escalates to Def-Con 5 level life-and-death grudge matches that put Reed and Sue, Ben and Johnny at each other's throats. With all the adults going insane, it's up to young Valeria and Franklin to save the day - and their family - before no one under the Baxter roof is left alive!</em></p><p><em>Plus a classic FF story by John Byrne from Fantastic Four #237 totally remastered like you've never seen before!</em></p>",

That’s why the Punisher is perched atop a building on the Jersey shore with a high-powered Skrull rifle, his crosshairs trained on a target in Midtown Manhattan. But who is his target -- and why? One thing’s for sure: They’re anything but helpless. Someone is watching their back. Someone big. Enter: The Sentry!</i></p><p>Frank notes that the heroes don't know how to go to war. He knows you have to get your hands dirty sometimes. As Norman Osborn is talking to a crowd of people, delivering a speech, the Punisher is four miles away with a Skrull sniper rifle. He pulls the trigger but the bullet is caught at the last second by the Sentry. Frank had prepared for eight different kinds of trouble except for that. Sentry is on him in a second. He tells Frank they can do it the easy way or hard way. Frank bolts.</p><p>Frank knows Sentry could have ended things right away so he must be holding back. He tries slowing him down to get away. Finally when it appears to be over, Frank holds up a remote. He tells Sentry that there's a bomb in the basement of a hospital and he has five seconds to get it. Having no choice, Sentry flies after it only to find it was a bluff. Returning, he finds Frank is gone.</p><p>Frank makes it to his van. Injured, he receives a message from someone claiming to be his new best friend. He tells Frank that Sentry will be on him in moments and he needs to leave. He gets instructions in which way to go. Staggering, he eventually reaches his final destination and collapses at the feet of the unknown man.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The first and third covers are a homage of the cover of <em><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-amazing-spider-man-129-the-punisher-strikes-tw/4000-105443/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-105443\">The Amazing Spider-Man #129</a></em>.</li><li>Reprinted in <em><a href=\"/punisher-dark-reign-1/4000-213520/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-213520\">Punisher: Dark Reign #1</a></em>.</li></ul>",

But Osborn, who is a master of manipulation, mentions that Moonstone is a criminal who should be locked up, she accepts with a smile.</p><p>In a bar, the son of Wolverine, Daken is about to enter for a drink wearing a cowboy hat similar to what his dad does, he sees Osborn with Ares having beer and pizza, Daken notices Osborn and begins to approach when Ares makes a rude comment about his conceivment, which causes Daken to pop his claws and Osborn calmly cools him down, and mentions that Daken's Father is a Samurai Warrior, and gives him the classic 80's brown Wolverine costume to Daken and says it will anger his Dad, which he (Osborn) wants to do, and Daken accepts.</p><p>Back in Colorado, Venom is at the Thunderbolts mountain where he has the pleasure of eating skrulls (yeah, like we really needed that in the book)who Osborn gives a dessert treat that minimizes his size and in a splash page, mirroring the first time Spider-man was in the black suit, Gargan gives off the same pose and and says he takes back all the bad things he's said about Osborn, most of them.</p><p>Bullseye sits down to have a meetin' with stormin' Normin. As soon as the meeting begins, Bullseye asks how Osborn wants to screw him over. Norman says he was thinking of offering him a new home, where Bullseye acts like he's getting fooled, but asks where. Norman mentions Avengers Tower, to which Bullseye's reaction causes him to fall back due to the shock of surprise.</p><p>Ms.Marvel (Carol Danvers) flies to her old home where Mr.O pours a drink and wants to negotiate her being a registered super-hero, meaning she works for him. She reacts that she is on crazy pills. Ares and Sentry are in the room as well. Carol talks to them asking why they are with Osborn. Ares acts lazy and mentions it's cause it is his home, and the Sentry has no real answer, which Danvers sheds tears, and flies out of the window in a rage.</p><p>Bullseye is in his Hawkeye mantle given to him by Osborn who sees Moonstone in the retro Ms,Marvel outfit. They are in a private room, and they see modifications to Tony Stark's Iron Man armor, and that the armor is what Osborn will wear himself.</p><p>In a press conference Norman Osborn holds, he brings out his recruits, and everybody say hi to the DARK REIGN annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd........ THE DARK AVENGERS!!!!!!!!!</p>",

In the early 20th Century, when lynchings were commonplace throughout the American South, a few courageous reporters from the North risked their lives to expose these atrocities. They were African-American men who, due to their light skin color, could 'pass' among the white folks. They called this dangerous assignment going 'incognegro.'

But when he returns to the sanctuary of Harlem, he's sent to investigate the arrest of his own brother, charged with the brutal murder of a white woman in Mississippi. With a lynch mob already swarming, Zane must stay 'incognegro' long enough to uncover the truth behind the murder in order to save his brother - and himself. He finds that the answers are buried beneath layers of shifting identities, forbidden passions and secrets that run far deeper than skin color.</i></p><h2>Back Blurb</h2><p><i>The early 20th century: an era when lynchings were commonplace throughout the American South.

            "description": "<p><strong>Overview</strong>:</p><p>Chris Powell is late for work. He runs through the house, only to be grabbed by his mother who wishes to see more of him now that he's home. Chris apologizes and promises he'll make more time. He then rushes to work at Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. where he is employed as security chief. As soon as he arrives, he has to deal with Vector who is attempting to escape his confinement. When Chris tackles him, Vector reaches for his amulet. This causes the gem itself to react, making Chris smash Vector down hard. Chris realizes what he's done, but when Dr. Necker tries to calm him down, she brushes her hand past the amulet and Chris assults her, too. Realizing the danger to everyone around him, Chris takes off and heads straight to where his old friends are having a meeting of Excelsior. Mickey Musashi is talking to the group and informing the new recruits what happened in Los Angeles. As she talks about being let down by friends, Chris makes himself known, and both Johnny and Mickey turn on him for betraying their cause. Chris understands their anger, but explains that he needs their help. The amulet is playing up again. Mickey calms down and asks how bad it is. Chris explains what happened at Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. and Mickey asks why he hasn't asked <em>them</em> to look at his armor. Chris tells her that he doesn't wish to become a lab rat. The pair of them head off, and start to become friendly again. When they reach Chris's home, the amulet begins to play up again, and suddenly, a new Darkhawk appears, crash-landing in their garden. Chris has no idea what's going on, and his problems are exacerbated when a <em>second</em> explosion rocks the house.</p><p><strong>Full synopsis</strong>:</p><p>(Long Island)</p><p>Chris Powell isn’t happy, which isn’t good for someone with anger issues. He runs through the house, pulling on his clothes after oversleeping due to the alarm not going off. He’s gonna be late for work. Not that it’s too big a deal, but with him, things tend to escalate. He loses control and ends up hurting the people he cares about… the people he loves. He eyes a photograph of himself with Mickey Musashi and another one of his family. A while ago he decided to do something about it and he changed his environment, moving from Los Angeles back to Long Island.</p><p>His mother calls him to breakfast and he rushes downstairs to find his two brothers, Jason and Jonathan already there. He tells her that he’s late, but she insists he eat something. His brothers reckon it took him long enough to get there. They reckon he was out last night beating on the Rhino. Chris admits that there were no babes or super-villains last night. Part of the deal he made with him mom when he returned was ‘no more secrets.’ His secrets tore his family apart once. He won’t allow that to happen again. He shoves a slice of toast into his mouth and prepares to dash, and his brothers want to see him transform. It was a big step trusting his younger brothers with the fact that he is a super hero.</p><p>He tries to leave but his mother collars him and insists that he kiss her goodbye. She moans that they’ve just got Chris back into their lives, but he’s so busy at work they never get time to spend together. Chris apologizes and assures her that he’ll take a day off soon and make it up to her. “Promise?” she asks. Chris promises and tells her that he loves her before giving her a peck on the cheek.</p><p>Chris leaves the house. He doesn’t want to dwell over regret. They’ve put the past behind them. Some things, though, he did embrace. He changes into his Darkhawk armor which is all thanks to a crazy amulet which he found years ago. He fought alongside the New Warriors and Spider-Man but then tried to leave his old life behind and grow up. However, he was soon back in the armor and it took over his life - making him lash out at those closest to him. He might have lost control before, he thinks, but now he has his life in order. He’s Darkhawk, and finally, all is good in the world.</p><p>He takes to the air and makes his way to Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Working here as security chief has helped Chris to control his anger by focusing on other people’s problems for a change. In an exotic energy research lab which also houses several super-villains, problems are never in short supply.</p><p>He is greeted by Dr. Necker who informs him of a breakout by a couple of the U-Foes. Another Skrull booby-trap helped shut down their containment grid for a few seconds allowing their escape. She adds that X-Ray was last seen in the basement. Before she can explain where Vector got to, he appears, smashing through the floor, demanding to be let out.</p><p>Darkhawk leaps into action immediately and confronts the villain, telling him it’s time for school. Vector punches his face mask, but Chris informs him that his armor just breaks the knuckles of those stupid enough to punch him. He adds that it’s also good at burning off unfortunate tattoos. “Care to sample?” He unleashes a blast from his chest plate which forces Vector to take to the air. Darkhawk follows and the pair of them tangle in mid-air. Vector reckons that the facility has underestimated him for the last time. Does Darkhawk think that he doesn’t know the <em>source</em> of his powers? He makes a grab for Chris’s amulet, and sparks start to fly.</p><p>Without even thinking about it, he blasts smash Vector away and he falls to the ground with his chest smoking. Chris can’t believe it. The amulet took over again and went nuts. He looks at Vector, lying on the ground with his mouth wide open. He chastises the gem for acting up after all this time. He had everything under control, but now, because of the gem, he’s got <em>more</em> blood on his hands. As his mind runs wild, Dr. Necker places her hand on his shoulder, but instinctively, the amulet takes over again, forcing Chris to sweep her aside with force using his wing.</p><p>Chris looks around and can’t believe what he’s done. He apologizes to Dr. Necker who realizes what’s going on and tries to get him to remain calm. He informs her that the gem is reacting on its own, and the doctor asks him to let them study it. Chris doesn’t wish to hurt anyone else and instead takes to the skies, leaving Dr. Necker calling for him to wait. Once airborne, Chris doesn’t want this to happen ever again. Unfortunately, the funny thing about leaving the past behind is that no matter how far you run, it always catches up with you… or you to <em>it</em>.</p><p>(later, the Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Manhattan)</p><p>Mickey Musashi introduces herself to Excelsior as the former hero known as Turbo. They each respond with a hi. She’s set up the group in New York after leaving Los Angeles behind. She tells them that she is glad they could make it, and understands that some of them had doubts. They probably asked themselves the same questions she did. How could they let this happen to them? Why bother to continue meeting? What’s the point anymore? Unfortunately, she adds, there are no easy answers, but they’ll find them together. For the new faces amongst the group, she offers an explanation of what happened in Los Angeles. She informs them that they tried to give up the costumes and secrets, and to rely on each other to keep themselves honest. Unfortunately, they were betrayed again, and this time it wasn’t their <em>powers</em> that ruined their lives. They were betrayed by their <em>friends</em>!</p><p>She looks around at Julie and Johnny as Chris loiters in the shadows, listening to every true word. Mickey says that it’s hard when someone you know changes right before your eyes until you barely recognize them. You can’t help wondering if, somehow, it’s your fault. Chris decides the time is right to present himself. “It wasn’t Mickey,” he whispers, “It was mine.”</p><p>Johnny immediately tells him that he should turn around and leave right away. Mickey follows suit, asking Chris how he <em>dare</em> show his face after he turned his back on them and went back to wearing his precious costume. Chris tries to get a word in edgeways, but Mickey asks if he’s come back to gloat… to feel better about himself. “Help,” Chris replies, “I need your help.” He explains that it happened again and he lost control. Mickey calms down and asks how bad it was. Chris replies that it was real bad. Someone got hurt. Mickey touches his cheek tenderly, and hugs him. It makes Chris feels safe, but only for a second.</p><p>Chris informs her that he hurt a villain. He was just doing his job, but he tried to rip the crystal from his costume and the suit went <em>crazy</em>. It acted on instinct - like it was scared. Suddenly, he was back in control as if nothing had happened. When he saw the looks on people’s faces and realized what he had done… He apologizes but didn’t know who else to turn to. Mickey was always able to help him. The rest of the group look on with interest as Mickey assures Chris that she’ll <em>always</em> be there for him.</p><p>With the meeting over, the pair of them head away. Mickey points out that he works at a government lab that <em>specializes</em> in alien energies. Did he never ask them to study his armor? Chris replies that he never wanted to be a lab rat. Mickey tells him to get over himself. This isn't about him. It's about the people who <em>care</em> about him. Isn't this why he left in the first place? He can try all he can to change the world, but nothing is going to be different if he doesn't change himself. She adds that the Darkhawk armor and the amulet are a part of the problem. He should have it looked at - go get some <em>professional</em> help. \"Do it for the family you came back for,\" says Mickey, with sincerity. \"Do it for <em>me</em>.\"</p><p>They take the train and Chris thinks about how Mickey has always helped him through the dark times... always been there for him and helped him get back in control. This feels like old times again. They reach Chris's house and he asks Mickey if she'd like to come in and meet the family. Mickey reckons it's a little early for all that. Family's not something she does on a first date. Chris asks if that's what it was; a date? Mickey almost blushes and replies that it's more of a first step. Chris reckons that's not such a bad thing. They almost kiss, but Mickey holds back, asking Chris to get his suit checked out before they go any further. It's okay, she assures him. She's not going anywhere.</p><p>As Mickey brushes her hand over his chest, the amulet kicks off again and Chris clutches his chest in agony. Mickey asks what's wrong. Chris informs her that the amulet is red hot and burning him. He plucks it from his chest and Mickey asks if this has ever happened before. Chris replies that it's been acting strange for a while, but not like <em>this</em>. He feels... As he speaks, they both look up and see something strange rocketing through the sky towards them. It then crashes heavily behind his house with a huge explosion. They rush to the scene and discover something surprising. There, in the smoking rubble, lies another Darkhawk, only this time their amulet glows blue. Chris is astonished. It looks like Darkhawk, but his is the only amulet <em>left</em>! The new Darkhawk speaks, weakly, informing Chris, \"That's what you were... led to believe... designate Powell.\"</p><p>Chris notices his mom and the kids appear at the door and he asks her to take Jason and Jonathan back inside the house, lock the door, dial the emergency Initiative number and tell them <strong>Code Black</strong>! Chris turns back to the stranger and he asks what they want. \"I'm here to save you...\" he replies. Chris asks from what!He can't even save himself! The new Darkhawk reaches for the red amulet and blue energies surround his arm. \"I cannot,\" he replies, \"Which is why I am here. Only together can we save ourselves!\" Chris is suddenly transformed and stands there with his armor on. He demands to know how the stranger did that. He replies that there is so much that he doesn't know. As he speaks, something rockets towards them at high speed. Whatever it is, it's already found them. Chris's mom appears at the door again having heard something. Chris anxiously tries to get her to go back indoors, and then it hits the ground hard, causing yet another huge explosion.</p><p>Reprints <a data-ref-id=\"4000-34018\" href=\"/darkhawk-dawn-of-the-darkhawk/4000-34018/\">Darkhawk #1</a>.</p>",

Kurt has realized that the X-Men just don't need him anymore. He hasn't been operating at his highest levels and even the biggest strength he has - teleportation - has been made redundant by Pixie who can do it better and more efficiently. Don't miss the departure of one of the most important characters in X-Men history.<br /><br /></i>Nightcrawler tells Cyclops he's quitting the X-Men.  He's not teaching, they have Pixie as a teleporter, he just needs time to himself.  He also received an invitation to the opening of the \"Nightcrawler Museum in Winzeldorf, Germany, his hometown.  Scott immediately thinks it's a trap.  Kurt says he needs to go and says goodbye to everyone.<br /><br />He is surprised to find signs and statues in his honor where he was almost killed by the townsfolk.  Entering the museum, he is shocked at all the memorabilia inside.  The woman that opened the museum is also shocked to see him there.  She didn't think he'd come.  Soon some men from the town come in calling him a 'beast.'  Because he is supposed to be a hero, they assume he's there to kill the monster in town that has apparently taken a child.<br /><br />Before he can agree to go after anyone, a big, horned, red furred creature busts in and attacks.  The monster escapes and Kurt feels he needs to go after it.  He finds it eating the remains of something in the woods.  He finds out it's just a deer.  It turns out the monster is just a sixteen year old boy.  He was dating a gypsy.  When he wanted \"more\" and turned to another girl, the gypsy's grandmother put a curse on him.  When he transformed into a monster, the town people quickly chased him out.<br /><br />Kurt almost convinces him that they need to talk to the people when the town's men have arrived to kill either of them.  Trying to defend the boy, Kurt is shot.  This causes the monster to attack the others.  Before killing an old man, Kurt stops him as the missing child appears.  Kurt teleports the old man and girl away.  Returning, he finds everyone dead, including the boy.  He shot himself.  Mephisto then arrives to gloat.  He tells Kurt that this could've been him.  He's a demon and needs to accept his place.  Kurt tells Mephisto he is wrong.  He now knows who he is and is proud of it.   Kurt then returns back to the X-Men.",

Today, eleven desperate men will travel to a desert island to compete in a series of outlandish challenges that will leave one of them rich and the rest of them dead. Among the competitors, a certain \"Merc with a Mouth,\" who's been hired to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a millionaire's son. The trail ended here for Junior, but will it for Deadpool? Not if he has anything to say about it. After all, nothing brings out Wade's competitive streak like cold, hard ca--I mean, justice.</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>Deadpool contracts with Mr. Kilgore to find his worthless actor son. Julian Kilgore was last known trying out for a Japanese game show called Pain Factor. It's a hush-hush operation and Deadpool goes in disguised as contestant Master Woo Pin Yeun. His arrival, however secretive, seems to be known by the show's producer, Gene Tell'Abate.</p><p>The contestants are introduced and the games begin. Very ridiculous challenges kill off each contestant one by one until it is Deadpool and one other left. They face Baltaar, an enormous man that immediately kills the other contestant. Deadpool quickly kills Baltaar and is awarded $1 million - then immediately ordered to be killed. Deadpool makes light work of his would-be assassins and confronts Gene Tell'Abate. The man is simply Julian Kilgore in disguise.</p><p>Deadpool returns to Mr. Kilgore and collects his reward for finding Julian. Deadpool then accuses Mr. Kilgore of being behind the games from the start. Mr. Kilgore admits to sending Deadpool to his son as a way to boost the game show's ratings. Deadpool then collects his game show winnings from Mr. Kilgore.</p>",

When gangster Orville Halloran arrives on the scene, fresh from a stretch in Sing Sing and eager to stretch his wings, Hell's about to get hotter. For P.I. Foggy Nelson and his loyal assistant Matt Murdock, it all starts when a desperate woman comes to their office with an irresistible story about her and Halloran. To Foggy, she's a client -- to Murdock, she's enough to make Halloran Daredevil's next target. But Murdock is about to find out that half-truths are poison truths, and that the Kitchen is full of history that will put him on a collision course with both the old Kingpin and the man who wants to replace him.</i></p>",

If you're a reader of JACK OF FABLES, then you're familiar with The Literals - an extended family of characters who literally embody literary notions. It's also very possible that one of The Literals may have created all of the Fables plus the universe in which they reside, unbeknownst to our beloved Fables.<br /><br />The full story on this enigmatic crew of characters begins here, the first in a 3-issue miniseries and Part 3 of \"The Great Fables Crossover,\" an epic, 9-part tale spanning the pages of FABLES and JACK OF FABLES. The story kicks off when Jack reveals the existence of The Literals to Fabletown, and things quickly get chaotic from there. Fables don't like the idea of having a living god who can wipe them out with the stroke of a pen, and have thus decided to get rid of The Literals. Will they succeed in erasing their creator from existence, or will he literally rub them out first?</i>",

            "description": "<i>Everyone's read the Tommy Taylor books, the popular series of novels turned pop culture phenomenon about a boy wizard's adventures. And everyone knows about Tom Taylor, the boy the novels were based on, whose life was so overshadowed by his Dad's fictional epic that Tom's become a lame Z-level celebrity at best and a human viral marketing tool at worst.<br /><br />But what if the resemblance goes even deeper? What if Tom is the boy-wizard of the books made flesh? And if that sounds crazy, why is it bringing him into the crosshairs of an ancient faction that has never been named in any book or text?<br /><br />To discover the truth about himself, Tom must search through all the places in history where fiction and reality have intersected. And in the process, he'll learn more about that unwritten cabal and the plot they're at the center of –– a plot that spans all of literature from the first clay tablets to the gothic castles where Frankenstein was conceived to the self-adjusting stories of the internet.</i><br />",

Unfortunately, there a few things are discouraging her from to him: he's a member of \"Class A,\" the top ranking class in school, whereas she's in \"Class F\"; he gets the top score on every exam; and he's so smart, popular and handsome that he's been class president every year. When Kotoki finally musters up the courage to present him with a love letter, though, Naoki outright refuses it, telling her point blank--with a look of disgust and boredom—that he doesn't like \"stupid girls.\" Poor Kotoko's worst nightmare! Her heart is broken, but then a change in circumstance forces Naoki and Kotoko to be together every day...!?</i></p>",

Within this seemingly uninhabited planet lies the greatest archaeological discovery in history, an ancient, abandoned complex of impossible proportions carved deep within the living rock, a mind-numbing labyrinth of passages, ramps, bridges, and galleries that seems to extend limitlessly. But as the exploration of the leviathan dead city proceeds deeper and deeper, the members of the team slowly begin to lose their grip on reality. But madness gives way to fear as the explorers begin to disappear one by one. Something else lives within the necropolis, a faceless horror as deadly and merciless as space itself, a lethal terror that has waited centuries to awake . . . and destroy.<br/><br/>At long last, Dark Horse Comics heralds the return of the heavyweight champion of modern science-fiction/horror, Aliens!</i>",

You may know him as the tough-talking crime boss who’s organizing the villains of NYC while wheeling and dealing with the likes of Loki and Dr. Doom. But what about his pregnant girlfriend, addict cousin and institutionalized mother that we met back in his debut mini? And what price is he paying for his rapid climb up the ranks of crime and power? Writer Jeff Parker (AGENTS OF ATLAS) and Kyle Hotz (THE HOOD: BLOOD FROM STONES) invite you to spend a week in the life of Parker Robinson, one of the key characters in Dark Reign, as he struggles to keep his professional and personal lives from destroying each other!</i></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Someone waits for someone on 53rd street on a stake-out.

Only one of these trucks is the real target. While Piledriver and Bushwacker wait up town, and Griffin and Crossfire wait at the George Washington Bridge, Thunderball, Wreaker and John King wait in Central Park. The target truck is filed with a fortune kept by the sex crazed son of the Sultan of Brunel Bubu Marzouk. Meanwhile Bubu is in a limo with a masked prostitute who turns out to be Madam Masque who finds out from Bubu the real location of the fortune truck.</p><p>The truck is in Central Park. Thunderball knocks over the truck with his wreaking ball. Two men get out of the trucks nad shot bullets at Thunderball and Wreaker which have no effect.

            "description": "<p><i>'Batman Reborn' begins here! With the reunited team of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely (ALL-STAR SUPERMAN, WE3, New X-Men), this first issue kicks off a 3-part story arc that can't be missed! The new Dynamic Duo hit the streets with a bang in their new flying Batmobile as they face off against an assemblage of villains called the Circus of Strange. They also tackle their first mission investigating a child who's been abducted by the mysterious Domino Killer. But will everything go smoothly? And who exactly are the new Batman and Robin? The newest era of The Dark Knight begins here!</i></p><p>Outside a tunnel, a cop car explosion occurs as Mr. Toad and his gang are driving away in a high speed chase. His henchmen become scared because the Batmobile isn't far behind. The new flying Batmobile comes up behind them in the tunnel. Damian tells Dick that he knew he could make a flying Batmobile. Dick shoots a rocket at Mr. Toad's car but hits right in front of it, causing it to go out of control. The Batmobile attaches itself to the top of Mr. Toad's car and flies out of the tunnel without hitting any other cars. They drop the car into the water near the docks. Mr. Toad climbs out of the car and starts swimming towards the pier. He thinks he has escaped but gets to the top, only to find Batman and Robin waiting for him. They both punch him at the same time and knock him down. His briefcase flies into the air and busts open, causing it's contents, which are dominoes, to fly out. Mr. Toad wakes up blindfolded while hanging out of the Batmobile by Batman. He interrogates him and drops him onto the ground, which isn't very far. Mr. Toad threatens Batman as the  Batmobile flies away.</p><p>Dick and Alfred are in the Batcave. Dick is in a suit and looking at a photo of himself with Bruce, Alfred, and Ace. Alfred asks if Dick is having second thoughts about becoming Batman. He says no but talks about how becoming Batman was his worst nightmare and he felt secure as Nightwing. He puts the photo in his bag. He says that he is also unsure about his decision of making Damian be his Robin. Alfred reassures him that Robin will be not a problem for Dick.</p><p>They drive away from Wayne Manor and Alfred tells Dick that Bruce was always proud of him. Especially now.</p><p>Inside Wayne Enterprises, Alfred is on the top floor in Bruce's office/penthouse, making food and drinks for Dick and Damian. He gets into the elevator and goes all the way to the underground base underneath the building. He enters and finds Dick, in costume, looking up dominoes on the Batcomputer. Alfred takes dinner to Damian, who is working on the Batmobile. Damian thanks him, but keeps working. Alfred compliments his work, but Damian dismisses him away. He goes back up to Dick, who is still on the Batcomputer. He notes that he cannot find Mr. Toad in any of the databases, but he feels he can find something because of his circus slang. He compliments Alfred on his food. Dick feels unsure of himself again. Damian then walks up and tells him that if he can't do it, then to stand aside. He tells him that he was made for the job and could do it all by himself. Dick tells him not today and to get in the car and not to forget his mask. Reluctantly, Damian complies. They drive out and say that crime is doomed.</p><p>A small tent, labeled Ghost Train, has young indentical girls marching out of the tent.</p><p>In jail, Mr. Toad tells the police can't keep him there and he has friends in high places and that they will take over the city.</p><p>A hot rod-style car is driving down the road with Phosphorous Rex in the passenger seat.</p><p>The Batmobile is flying through Gotham. Inside, Damian is telling Dick that he needs to earn his respect because he isn't his father. Dick tells him to lose the attitude because he can still give the Robin job back to Tim Drake. He tells the Batmobile to hover and the two of them jump out and glide down towards Gotham City Police Headquarters. He says: \"This is it. Batman and Robin. Together again for the first time.\"</p><p>On top of Gotham City Police Headquarters, Commissioner Gordon turns on the Batsignal. An officer comes up and tells Gordon and another officer that Mr. Toad said he saw Batman and Robin in a flying Batmobile. Gordon tells him that they can hope. One of the officers says it's been months and the other says that means he's never coming back. Gordon says it's worth a try. Batman and Robin glide down.</p><p>In front of Gotham City Police Headquarters, Phosphorous Rex gets out of the car and starts screaming for help. The police think he is on fire and try to help him. He then tricks them and begins choking the two officers.</p><p>In the home of Niko, he is packing up his stuff. His daughter, Sasha, asks him why he's packing since he told her that they will make a new life. He tells her that after escaping from Batman, he needs to get away from Gotham City. Lev knocks on the door and Niko opens it. The group of girls are holding Lev up. Sasha asks who the girls are. They knock out Niko.</p><p>Later, Niko is tied to the table and Pyg is standing over him. He tells Niko that he wants him to feel every moment of his transformation. He says that Niko betrayed him, but Niko says he doesn't even know who he is. Pyg puts a fuming deformed face onto Niko's. The girls hand a saw to Pyg and he says he will make Niko perfect. The girls force Sasha to watch. Pyg says that Sasha will be next.</p>",

A weird secret. Tony Chu is Cibopathic, which means he gets psychic impressions from whatever he eats. It also means he's a hell of a detective, as long as he doesn't mind nibbling on the corpse of a murder victim to figure out whodunit, and why. It's a dirty job, and Tony has to eat terrible things in the name of justice. And if that wasn't bad enough, the government has figured out Tony Chu's secret. They have plans for him whether he likes it or not. Presenting a twisted new series about cops, crooks, cooks, cannibals and clairvoyants, written by JOHN LAYMAN (Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness, House of M: Fantastic Four and PUFFED) with mind-blowing art by astonishing comics newcomer ROB GUILLORY.</p><p>The issue opens up with a chef slicing-and-dicing through vegetables. Ultimately he slices his finger and it leads to him dropping blood into the soup. Meanwhile, officers Tony Chu and John Colby are visiting a local food market to pickup some food while they finish their last night of stakeout. Back at their van, the two officers are watching civilians carryout illegal chicken dinners. When Chow Chu comes out with a 25 lbs bag of black market chicken, Tony immediately jumps out to arrest his older brother, but Colby stops him just in time to talk sense into him. At this time the black market chicken ringleader, D. Bear, finally reveals himself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2635477-screen_shot_2012_10_07_at_11.39.15_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2635477\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.51893287435456\" data-width=\"1162\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1162px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2635477-screen_shot_2012_10_07_at_11.39.15_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2635477\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2635477-screen_shot_2012_10_07_at_11.39.15_pm.png\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2635477-screen_shot_2012_10_07_at_11.39.15_pm.png 1162w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/2635477-screen_shot_2012_10_07_at_11.39.15_pm.png 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2635477-screen_shot_2012_10_07_at_11.39.15_pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>As the two officers 'lock-and-load' to go take on D. Bear they are stopped by agent Mason Savoy and reminded that the F.D.A. are allowing D. Bear's operation to continue for the greater good. Savoy gives them free admission to the black market chicken restaurant as a token of his favor. While inside the two officers order chicken related meals just because it is free, but when Tony tastes his soup, his cibopath powers kick in and gives him visions of the different people the chef has killed and placed into the soup (the same chef that cut his finger). When Tony and John reach the kitchen, John immediately takes a butchers knife to the head (no thanks to the serial killer chef) and passes out on the floor. Tony goes alone and tries to reason with the chef, however he refuses to be taken to jail and he instead decides to slice his own throat -- making Tony ultimately having to gain the information by biting him and using his cibopathic abilities. In the end, Tony is fired for biting the corpse of the chef, John Colby is placed in surgery, and Tony gains a new job as an agent of the F.D.A., thanks to Savoy for saving Tony from being thrown into an asylum.</p>",

Following the aftermath of BATTLE FOR THE COWL, a new Batman watches over Gotham City. But not everyone is ready to give up on the old one. Someone believes that Bruce Wayne may still be alive…and that someone is Red Robin. But who is wearing the Red Robin costume, and why is he traveling the globe looking for a dead man? Whoever he is, he's not alone in his search!</i> <br /> <br /><h3>Extended Plot Summary</h3>The First issue in an all new series starts off with a kidnapping of the daughter of an outspoken Spanish politician.  The thought boxes reveal that the kidnappers wanted money as well as a political statement.  No one believed she would be returned alive, however they did pay the ransom.  The transaction went south as both the money and the girl got away.  We find out the character who's thought bubbles we are reading arrived in Madrid 4 hour hours prior and he needed to \"stretch his legs after a long flight.\"  The character begins to beat the criminals to a pulp, asking if he has crossed a line and if that even matters anymore.  Batman is dead and he sure as hell isn't Robin. <br /> <br />We meet the title character dressed in the familiar Red Robin garb.  As he begins to take on the criminals one by one in the room, he realizes through their actions the girl is still alive.  His final obstacle is a a cyborg who basically shoots fire from his hands.  As his flaming hands are about to punch our hero he stops the punch with his own hand and headbutts the final criminal.  He saves the girl but that's not the reason he came here.  The hero is revealed to be Tim Drake as he tends to his hand that he caught the punch from fire hands he reflects on the stupidity of his actions.  Tim Drake would know better he thinks and then realizes that he's Tim Wayne.  Through the internal monologue we learn that he has been traveling around the world, telling himself over and over again he knows he's right. <br /> <br />We get a flashback to Tim in the Batcave talking to Dick Grayson, the new Batman, about how his life has been torn down yet again.  It appears that Dick has chosen a Robin and it's not Tim.  Damian Wayne is taking over Tim's old job.  Dick tries to tell Tim that he's not his protege, he views Tim as his equal and that he'll be okay.  Dick apparently takes Damian as his Robin because he wants to try to teach him and prevent him from killing someone.  Before the conversation can continue Damian shows up and starts trash talking Tim.  Tim becomes so enraged about Damian calling him Drake, he punches Damian stating \"My name is Tim Wayne!\"  Dick has to restrain Tim telling him to back off, which Tim takes to heart and apparently turns his back on the batcave and the family.  Once out of the cave he begins trashing some things eventually cutting his hand in the ensuing chaos.  We then switch back to present time Prague where someone was thrown out of a window. <br /> <br />Back in Paris with Tim, he's riding through the streets and encounters some criminals which Tim has no trouble taking out.  Something he does not enjoy because it's distracting him from his search.  Flash back to after Tim cuts his hand, he seems to have let out all his frustration and in a moment of silence he blurts out \"He's Alive.\"   The \"He\" Tim is talking about is Bruce Wayne, the person the entire Batman Family believes to be dead.  Bruce is all Tim has left, and he has to find him.  The issue ends with Tim looking at a map thinking Bruce would never give up on him so he won't give up on Bruce.  We learn that someone else knows Tim is out and looking.  They are spying on him through a pair of binoculars from across the way, minions of Ra's Al Ghul.",

As a new Batman rises on the streets of Gotham City, the heroes, villains and citizens take notice. How will the police feel about this new Batman, and can he control the crime in Gotham the way the old Batman did?</p><p>This new series also features a regular ongoing co-feature starring Manhunter written by Marc Andreyko and illustrated by Georges Jeanty (Buffy Season 8)! Kate Spencer lost a friend during the chaos of BATTLE FOR THE COWL, and now she wants payback. As usual, she'll use any means necessary to get it. </p><p> </p><p>This comic starts with Commissioner Gordon and his Gotham City Police Unit going to a local jewel shop. Harley Quinn is in there alone with the cashier who fainted because he knew who she was. Harley exits the building and tells Gordon that it was all a big misunderstanding and that she was just trying to shop. Gordon is surprised that she had money, which she got for helping Catwoman get even with Hush. Batman then tells Harley that she should get out of town to start a new life. Abuse then appears for the very first time. He goes a girl named Katie from getting sold to a man. Later Firefly creates a chemical to set the body of another person, to flames. Firefly lets his chemical loose in the Gotham City subway, while Damian Wayne visits Hush. Damian then leaves – and as Robin – saves a man in a car, who is on fire. Batman then saves another man in front of Gordon and then gives Gordon's Police Unit, 10 Foam Capsule launchers to stop people from burning. The comic ends with Batman and Robin staring at a burning Batman emblem spread over Gotham.</p>",

Catwoman, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn are tired of playing by other people's rules--regardless of which side of the law they're on. These tough ladies have a new agenda all their own, and they'll use any means necessary to pursue it. But can they get along and work as a team? And who will get hurt along the way?</em></p><p>The issue starts off with Catwoman balancing on a gargoyle. She hears a scream and finds Boneblaster attacking a couple. He is mouthing off about who he is and Catwoman attacks him from the back. They fight back and forth until Poison Ivy starts strangling him with her vines. Poison Ivy and Catwoman talk while the vines beat the crap out of Boneblaster.</p><p>They go to Riddler's apartment where he is being controlled by Ivy's drug inducing plants. Catwoman and Ivy talk about the money that Catwoman gave to her and Harley Quinn. Poison Ivy says she gave it to a rain forest charity. Harley barges in dressed in a schoolgirl outfit. She's been shopping. Catwoman finds out that they plan on moving into Riddler's apartment and that Harley is spending almost all her money. Harley announces that she's over the Joker but sounds desperate at the thought of him calling her. Catwoman offers to them to join her and stick together. They agree but have to find out something first. They go into another room and Ivy uses the plants to contact Zatanna and ask her if she messed with the spell that helped Catwoman's heart surgery go well. Zatanna claims her spell was all good. They accept it. Then they all are happy about being a team and Catwoman invites them to live in her new house.</p><p>Boneblaster then breaks in through the wall and challenges them all, including the Riddler. He calls Harley Quinn \"Schoolgirl\" but she corrects him. He gets even more excited about fighting \"Joker's chick\". They all attack him while Riddler is still drug induced on the couch. Boneblaster accidentally knocks him out of his drug induced state. Catwoman pulls out some electrical wires and puts them in Boneblaster's hands. They electrocute him. His gloves are destroyed. Riddler gets pissed about what happened to his house. The girls leave and Riddler gets his question mark cane. Boneblaster admits that Riddler, Joker, and Two-Face are his idols. Riddler tells him that meeting your heroes are always a disappointment. He then beats the crap out of Boneblaster with his cane.</p><p>At the Gotham City Shelter for Cats and Dogs, the Broker is selling the place to Catwoman. She takes it and he then gets a phone call from the Mad Hatter about a new place. He leaves. Poison Ivy then blasts some truth gas into Catwoman's face and asks, \"Who is Batman?\"</p>",

Yes, Mac Gargan, America’s favorite sociopath-turned-symbiote-host-turned-hero-hunter now takes the spotlight as Norman Osborn’s sinister Spider-Man. With the Dark Reign-a-raining, the lives of our mighty marvel heroes are being destroyed left and right – but for guys like Mac, the world is their oyster and the chef’s covering the bill. Mac’s a beloved hero. Women love him, men want to be him and nobody wants to run into him after midnight – because the symbiote is still pretty darn hungry...<br /></i> <br />Mac Gargan (formerly known as the <b>Scorpion</b> and most recently <b>Venom</b>), who has been masquerading as Spider-Man during the Dark Reign storyline, has been hired by Norman Osborne as a local \"superhero\".  <br /><br />Held on a tight leash and being told when he could go out and whom he could interact with, Gargan rebelled by going out on his own and catching a burglar by the name of General Wolfram.  Wolfram claimed to be a product of genetic experiments by Nazi scientists, but Gargan made quick work of him and Wolfram's German accent appeared to be fake, putting the rest of his origin into question.<br /><br />While Gargan reveled in pleasing the crowd, he secretly took the money Wolfram had stolen and bit off one of Wolfram's arms.<br /><br />To celebrate his victories, Gargan goes to a nightclub and picks up a woman he decides to name Candy.  He passingly mentions a woman named Destiny that disappeared recently, alluding to the fact that he had recently taken her and murdered her.  Unfortunately, the people there do not keep tabs on the women working there.<br /><br />Gargan returns to the Avengers Tower with Candy in tow to an angry Norman Osborne.  Osborne is infuriated that Gargan went behind is back and city officials are now wondering where the money he had supposedly rescued ended up.  The two come face to face in a power struggle, with Gargan reluctantly backing down.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the DB's chief Dexter Bennett exclaims a new love for this new Spider-Man.  While Betty Brant and the rest of the staff seem reluctant in embracing the new \"superhero\", Bennett instructs everyone to research every inch of Spider-Man.<br /><br />Betty Brant tries to get the attention of former Bugle editor and now New York mayor J. Jonah Jameson, but he is too busy in press conferences over recent crime increases since his time in office.  Jameson comes across Doctor Shep Gunderson, a man who proposes to rehabilitate former criminals.  Jameson quickly rejects his offer before leaving.<br /><br />A small man in a costume enters General Wolfram's hospital room where he is recovering from his injuries against Gargan.  It is revealed that the small man is in fact Doctor Shep Gunderson, under the guise of the Redeemer, who wants to take Wolfram and other criminals (Doctor Everything, Eleven, The Hippo, and Dementoid) under his wing to rehabilitate them.  He reveals that the only way to do this is to take down the man responsible for their crimes in the first place, the Amazing Spider-Man.<br /><br />It is also revealed that Gargan had killed Candy and left her body in Jameson's bed, framing the mayor for her murder.",

Then at 18 you decide to track down your mother. Within hours of finding her, she’s lying naked and dead at your feet. So you run to Greek Street. And that’s when your troubles really begin… Boasting a cast of sexy strippers, murderous gangsters, body-snatching mad women and a disturbed young girl who can see the future, GREEK STREET is Peter Milligan’s reimagining of those brutal and visceral tragedies that graced the Theater of Dionysus in Ancient Greece – bloody tales about incest, homicide, beautiful oracles, all-knowing choruses, kings, monsters and gods – played out on the mean streets of modern-day Red-Light London. Milligan – best known for his super-smart Vertigo work like SHADE THE CHANGING MAN, HUMAN TARGET and now HELLBLAZER– joins forces with illustrator Davide Gianfelice (NORTHLANDERS) to create an epic ongoing series that’s both familiar yet completely new and always with the bloody, visceral edge that makes it a Vertigo book. Take a trip to GREEK STREET where the old stories are not through with us yet.</i><br />",

Wrapped from head to toe in bandages and wearing weird goggles, he quietly took up residence in the sleepy town's motel. Driven by curiosity, the townfolk quickly learn the tragic story of his past, and of the terrible accident that left him horribly disfigured. Eventually, the town embraces the stranger as one of their own - but do his bandages hide more than just scars? Inspired by H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man, THE NOBODY explores themes of identity, fear and paranoia in a small community from up-and-coming alternative comics creator and Xeric Award-winner Jeff Lemire (The Essex County Trilogy) in a story that'll have you guessing until the very end.</i></p>",

As the walls come alive, everyone is slowly driven mad-defenseless against the evil in the building, stripped of free will, leaving only confusion, chaos, and eventual death. Originally self-published as a two-volume book, this groundbreaking work receives a deluxe presentation in a hardcover edition with a sketchbook section.<br /></i>",

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. Strangers have come to the village of Emond's Field, located in Two Rivers, during the Bel Tine holiday. With theses strangers come stories of the outside world: tales of war and of a man who claims to be the Dragon Reborn, the one prophesized to save the world, and also to destroy it in his madness.

Union doctor Robert Dickering found himself on the wrong side of the battle lines, and despite his heroic treatment of a fallen enemy soldier, he also found himself on the wrong end of a noose!

Local legend, Luke Cage, invincible, unstoppable, unflappable, finds that out the hard way when he returns to the mean streets of Prohibition-era Harlem after a ten-year stretch in Riker’s Island. All he wants is to be back in the loving arms of his woman, but certain powerful men have different plans for Cage. Willis Stryker, Cage’s childhood friend turned Godfather of Harlem, wants him on his crew, and under his thumb. And wealthy white socialite Randall Banticoff, whose wife is now very dead, murdered in a Harlem alley, wants Cage to investigate her death. Cage is about to learn that coming home is never easy, and to survive he might just have to kill a whole lot of people.</i></p>",

And exactly which Fabletown denizens are no longer active (dead, alive or otherwise) just might shock you into a comic book coma. Also in this volume, you'll find the 4-part story featuring Freddy and Mouse, two local rogues who just want to get along and perhaps turn a bit of profit in the post-war, topsy-turvy world. Meanwhile, in Fabletown, a new political group forms called the Society of Seconds, and what they want doesn't seem very reasonable at all.</i></p>",

It is to this stronghold of the Inquisition that the souls of Hell have escaped to possess the living, spreading sin, murder, and chaos. Amid the carnage, one man is blessed with the clarity to recognize the demons that prey on his countrymen -- and the means to return them to the fires of Hell. But as the stakes rise, the lines separating good and evil begin to blur, and the Marquis -- the dark avenger whom even demons fear to cross -- finds himself torn between the blind faith that has defined his life and the bitter truths exposed under his new sight.</i>",

But who is this young woman, and why has she donned the cape and cowl?</i></p><p>In the first issue of the new Batgirl series, Batgirl is seen stopping an illegal street race from continuing and in the process saving some kids lives. Her outing is nothing less than sloppy however, and as Batman and Robin look on they don't know much, but they do know that this Batgirl is not Cassandra Cain. Stephanie Brown is revealed to be the girl behind the cowl, and the next morning her mother wakes her up telling her how proud she is that she has given up being a vigilante. As Stephanie hides the Batgirl suit in her closet, her mother reveals that today is her first day at her college.</p><p>Meanwhile Barbara Gordon is with Dr. Leslie Thompkins as they converse about Barbara never being seen. Wendy Harris appears to now be wheel-chair bound and Leslie tries to get Barbara to be a guide to her. Barbara reveals that she is still angry about being in a chair forever, but before the conversation can continue, Wendy falls out of her chair, prompting Dr. Thompkins to assist her. As Barbara heads home on the subway, a group of thugs try to attack her but she takes care of them quickly.</p><p>Back at Gotham University, Stephanie Brown is in class but not paying much attention to her Philosophy teacher. As she draws Bat-Symbols on her notebook, she remembers a moment from three weeks ago involving her and the former Batgirl, Cassandra Cain. As they fight some thugs Cassandra tells Stephanie that her self-delusion is what makes them friends. After they finish all the thugs, Cassandra begins taking off the Batgirl costume, telling Stephanie the fight is hers now because she won't fight for the symbol anymore of the man who represented it and embodied it is dead.</p><p>Barbara Gordon is having a meal with her father, Jim Gordon. He tries to set Barbara up with a new detective in town, but she flatly refuses. Jim calls her out, wondering if she's making herself not want to be happy. Before she has to answer she gets a call from Dick Grayson. Jim asks \"anyone special\" to which she replies it \"depends on which one of us you ask.\"</p><p>Stephanie continues to struggle with whether or not she should give up her costume, but like always she gives in to \"one more night.\" As the new officer in town is in a hostage situation, Batgirl arrives to save the day. There is a problem of a rocket launcher going off, but besides that, it was a clean save. The new officer is revealed to be Detective Gage, who doesn't know which Bat saved him. As she leaves to go home he simply says he's new in town.</p><p>At home Stephanie showers and recalls last night, how she shouldn't do it anymore and saying how it was one hell of a way to go out. But then she looks at her Batgirl costume and thinks she should sign up for a sewing class. As she heads downstairs she is shocked to see Barbara Gordon sitting at her table saying they need to talk.</p>",

No matter how  relentlessly awe-inspiring John's achievements get, it's his brother who's  always seen as the hero. So John sets out to upstage his brother one more time.  He'll show the world just how much heroism money can buy as the amazing (and  suspiciously well-equipped) Web. But when a dark fate arrives for his brother,  John learns first-hand what a hero leaves on the line, and that there are worse  losses than the ones that hit your checkbook!  </i></p>",

Even more remarkable is that Gus is part of a rare new breed of human/animal hybrid children who have emerged in its wake, all apparently immune to the infection.</i> <i>Enter Jepperd, a violent, hulking drifter who soon takes in Gus and promises to lead him to \"The Preserve,\" a fabled safe-haven for hybrid children. Along the way they'll have to contend with science militias, deadly scavengers, rival bounty hunters, and hybrid worshipping cultists as they fight to make it to safety and solve the mysteries of this deadly new frontier.</i> <i>This bizarre and haunting new series is boldly written and illustrated by Eisner-nominated creator Jeff Lemire and elegantly colored by fellow Eisner nominee Jose Villarubia.

This debut volume reveals Madame Xanadu's centuries spanning origin from Camelot to the court of Kubla Khan to 1940s New York City and beyond… Featuring an introduction by James Robinson (STARMAN).</i></p><h2>Back Blurb</h2><p><i>Who is Madame Xanadu?</i></p><p><i>She is one of comics' most legendary and mysterious magicians. For years she has aided the powerful and powerless alike when supernatural forces threaten our world. Madame Xanadu has played a part in countless stories, but her own story has never been told.</i></p><p><i>Until now.</i></p><p><i>From learning her craft in the arms of Merlin to reading the fortunes of Marie Antoinette, from serving in the court of Kublai Khan to cheating Death of the Endless herself in a game of cards, the life of this ageless mage has woven its way through history and mythology alike. And from Morgana Le Fey to Jack the Ripper to the enigmatic Phantom Stranger, menacing forces have haunted her every step.</i></p><p><i>Follow Madame Xanadu from the mists of Camelot to the bright lights of 1930s New York City as her strange, centuries-old destiny unfolds. And learn the secrets that a thousand years of enchantment have kept hidden even from the soothsayer herself.</i></p><p><i>Written by comics legend Matt Wagner (TRINITY, Grendel, Mage) with stunning art by Amy Reeder Hadley (Fool's Gold), MADAME XANADU: DISENCHANTED is a spellbinding saga of gothic romance that spans time and space.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p>Kitty Pryde was an average school girl with a secret.  Her parents weren't sure how to handle her 'quirks', and the other girls at school called her a mutie freak.  However, when Mr Lehnsherr arrived offering Kitty a scholarship to Xavier's Acdemy for the Gifted, Kitty's life soon changed. <br/> <br/>If life in an exclusive school in New York wasn't scary enough; she soon discovered that all the pupils there were mutants, and that she was the only girl!  The only other women were the teachers; Storm who was an outrageous punk, and Ms Grey had been away all semester recruiting other new students.<br/> <br/>Almost as soon as she arrived she received an icey reception from Iceman, and a warm welcome from Pyro, Angel &amp; the other members of the Hellfire Club.  The exclusive group of high-achieving young mutants took Kitty into their club and she quickly started dating Pyro.  Although scared of Physical Education, she was buddied up with Nightcrawler who was impressed with her phasing powers.  Iceman remained frosty with her, but appeared shocked when Kitty remained inside an iceblock for over 5-minutes during Phys-Ed.  In the middle of the night she found Gambit cooking delicious snacks, and as a 'thank you' he stole a kiss on the hand.  She also formed a sibling-like friendship with Forge, which Pyro was jealous of.  The Hellfire Club spent many hours hanging out in the Danger Room, and would turn it into their private beach, park, or night club.  They preferred to party and would chase Kitty around the Academy instead of letting her study.<br/> <br/>However, Pyro became possive of Kitty.  Any of her non-Hellfire Club friends like Cyclops or Blob were quickly be chased away.  On a school outing to New York City, Kitty wanted time alone with Pyro, but instead they were trailed around by Longshot &amp; Havok.  Trouble stirred up when they came across a small anti-mutant protest in the park.  Kitty wanted to leave, but the Hellfire Club boys aggrevated the situation with their powers.  Cyclops fought with his own brother, but Havok appeared to become possessed.  His powers raged out of control and destroyed a bandstand.  Although Kitty's powers helped to save Iceman, Professor Xavier was caught underneath the bandstand.  Storm &amp; Colossus rescued him from the wreckage, but Professor Xaver was severly injured and remained hospitalised for the rest of the semester. <br/> <br/>Kitty &amp; Pyro's relationship ended, but as she was leaving for the holidays Kitty found a present; a crystal-like ice sculpture of a heart. <br/> <br/>What will the next semester bring when Kitty meets more new students?  How will she cope when she's no longer the only girl in school? </p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Alan Moore and David Lloyd's powerful epic about loss of freedom and individuality gets the Absolute treatment for the first time in this new, oversized slipcase edition! Taking place in a totalitarian England following a devastating war that changed the face of the planet, V FOR VENDETTA was the inspiration for the hit 2005 movie starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. This amazing graphic novel spotlights a mysterious man in a white porcelain mask and his young protégé as they fight political oppressors through terrorism and seemingly absurd acts. It's a gripping tale of the blurred lines between ideological good and evil and details a world where political and personal freedoms are non-existent. This new edition features the improved production values and coloring from the 2005 hardcover in larger format for optimum enjoyment of the stunning art and story that the Portland Mercury called, \"Perhaps Moore's most powerful work.\"</i></p>",

Every great action hero got started somewhere: Batman Began. Bond had his Casino Royale. And for John McClane, more than a decade before the first DIE HARD movie, he's just another rookie cop, an East Coast guy working on earning his badge in New York City during 1976's Bicentennial celebration. Too bad for John McClane, nothing's ever that easy. Join legendary industry creator Howard Chaykin on a thrill ride that's rung up over $1 billion in box office worldwide and become the gold standard for classic action! Yippee Ki Yay!</p>",

Nothing good, nothing good at all. It's lies, interrogations, double-crosses and just a whole bunch of meanness - It's the LIST. Plus, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\" href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\"><i>Nick Fury</i></a> Files and a classic reprint.</p><p><b>Second Story: Today Earth Died!</b></p><p>(reprint from Strange Tales (1951) #168)</p><p>Nick Fury is reflecting on his recent encounter with Yellow Claw in space. Except Claw turned out to be a fake automaton! Nick is rehearsing a speech he wants to make to Jimmy Woo, inviting him to come and work for SHIELD. He dozes off but is awoken by an alert from Val (The Contessa) that something strange has been seen in the sky above New York. Fury hops in Val's Jaguar and heads off to see what's happening. People in the street are looking up at the strange sight of a weird space ship and psychedelic colors floating above the city. Chet Huntley of NBC reports on the scene, describing the arrival of Nick Fury, and the appearance of the strange occupant of the ship: a golden man in a tunic carrying a curious gem in his hand.</p><p>Meanwhile back at SHIELD, The Contessa and Dum Dum exchange in some casual banter as they get ready to head out and help Nick.</p><p>At the city, the golden man explains his presence. His name is Vaengr. He comes from a race that has decided to give humanity a means to end hatred, crime, war and violence! The gem he is carrying will grant Nick this wish if he chooses.</p><p>The Contessa and Dum Dum show up just in time to see Nick boarding the ship. The Contessa is suspicious - Nick urges them to join him, and The Contessa to use her scanner on their surroundings. When she points it at Vaengr he appears distinctly inhuman!</p><p>We briefly cut to see Jimmy Woo watching a video recording from Nick Fury, urging him to leave the FBI and join SHIELD. Jimmy silently absorbs what he hears in the message.</p><p>Back at the space ship Vaengr lashes out with an energy bolt - he knows he's been rumbled! Dum Dum and The Contessa are turned to ash right in front of Nick Fury! Vaengr moves to do the same to Nick but Fury's too quick and he throws a pellet at him that traps the alien, stopping him from reaching for his headband. Nick steals it for himself and puts it on. Both he and Vaengr now turn into horrific alien monsters and start to fight. As they wrestle, Vaengr reveals that the gem, the 'prism of miracles,' is in fact a 'world killing machine.' Vaengr was sent to Earth to eradicate all life. He says humans have turned on the machine and upset the balance of the Universe and now it is all over! Everything freezes for a moment... Then Nick Fury wakes up!</p><p>Dum Dum is standing over him - he thinks Fury is acting strangely, like he's never done before. He suggests they go to the gym for a few rounds together. Nick mulls over what must have all been a horrible dream. Dum Dum walks off - as he goes he says Val has news of a strange UFO that has been spotted. Nick freezes in terror and drops his cigar match...</p>",

Satan’s twisted tongue removes the tragedy of Sith’s death, and restores hope with the promise of her being alive. But there’s a catch… It seems that the two Gods that govern all of existence let her be stolen from her world by an unknown force. Now she is floating aimlessly in and out of dimensional planes known as the “Dream Worlds.” Satan implores Guy to take action and call upon his latent power to break through his world’s plane, search out Sith, and take vengeance upon the vile Gods that caused this atrocity.<br/> <br/> What’s a “Guy” to do?  Especially when you think you’re going out of your skull, and a suspiciously cliché and creepy man in a graveyard tells you that your dead girlfriend is alive.</p> <p> Join Guy as he battles his perceptions of reality and starts to discover things that go beyond his world and into another.</p> <p>An ongoing psychological drama-comedy about life, love, the politics of Gods, and everything you wanted to know about existence, but were afraid to ask!</p>",

Now Norman Osborn - the head of the corrupted Dark Avengers and director of the paramilitary intelligence agency H.A.M.M.E.R. - wants the finest fighting force the God of War can provide. He charges Ares with hand-picking an elite squad of soldiers and beating them into the hardest, sharpest warriors ever to wield a M-60 in each hand.

Their happiness is short lived after the Queen of Hearts' scouts find and then capture them.<br />John is locked and manacled in the Queen's dungeon. He is kept there and tortured for many years. While incarcerated he tells another prisoner the story of how he came to Wonderland. He tells of how he was a dangerously progressive doctor and eventual serial killer in England-- none other than Jack the Ripper.

They have a couple drinks, show each other a good time. And when he wakes up the next morning, the guy finds himself in a bathtub full of ice, with two fewer kidneys than he had the night before. Well, Wolverine's heard this story too and he ain't too thrilled by it. Then, someone or something is laying down roadtraps for passing motorists. Is it the work of a serial killer? Or is the entire town in on the crime? The only way for Logan to know for sure is to offer himself as bait. Next, see Wolverine at his fiercest as he meets the Road Dawgs, the meanest, nastiest, most jacked-up bike gang you could ever encounter. Plus, Wolverine heads to Vegas. In a place where anyone will wager on anything, it's no wonder that Logan finds himself in a game of Russian Roulette surrounded by rowdy Russian mobsters. Finally, in \"The Anniversary,\" it's terror at thirty-thousand feet! As Logan heads to Japan for the anniversary of Mariko's death, his 747 is suddenly seized by a group of terrorists who plan on blowing up the craft over downtown Honolulu!</em></p><p><em>Collects Wolverine: Chop Shop, Wolverine: Switchback, Wolverine Holiday Special: Flies To A Spider, Wolverine Revolver &amp; Wolverine: The Anniversary.</em></p>",

But this is not the Pinoccho you might remember. A growing nose that is a never-ending stake supply and his desire to avenge the death of his beloved father Geppetto make him the perfect vampire impaler.</i></p><p><i>With Master Cherrt the carpenter and the Blue Fairy, who is a little older and grayer than she used to be, Pinocchio protects the town from an undead menace and discovers that the vampire have a deeper agenda than the mere sucking of blood.</i></p>",

Iceman! See the small town beginnings that helped forge the coolest mutant of them all! Written by Roberto Aguirre Sacasa with fan favorite artist Phil Noto! Don't miss it!</span></em></p><p><span style=\"font-size:16px;line-height:25px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif;\">Fort Washington, Long Island.</span></p><p>Madeline Drake is in the kitchen, humming and making lunch for her son Bobby. She calls him back into the house, and when she looks outside he's standing in the pool, which is frozen solid.</p><p>Later his mother and father are talking to him in his room. His Dad tells him that he hasn't done anything wrong and that it's not his fault. His Mom says that they've seen stories about people like him on the news. People who are special. Bobby, who is scared, wants to know what's wrong with him. They explain that people like him are called mutants, but that doesn't mean they don't love him. But he's going to have to be very careful.</p><p>The day before his birthday he is having lunch with Judy, a classmate. A bully named Rocky interrupts their conversation. Bobby gets angry and his fists turn slightly blue. Judy feels it getting colder. That night, while his Mom watches Professor Xavier on television Bobby sneaks out the window to practice using his powers. He glides around the trees on his ice slide. Later he is walking through town, and sees anti-mutant grafitti.</p><p>When he gets home he calls up Judy and asks her out to a movie date at the community center for his birthday. As they leave, she wants to stop and kisses him. Bobby tries to tell her about him being a mutant, but he's interrupted by Rocky again and this time he has friends.</p><p>He makes Judy get behind him, and warns the gang that they don't want to do this. Before anyone can move he freezes three of the gang's hands. He tells Judy to get down and freezes Rocky in a block of ice. Thinking Bobby killed him, the rest of Rocky's gang takes off. Judy begins to panic, while Bobby tries to explain what he did, but she calls him a freak. She then tells him that he should get out of there because people are going to come for him.</p><p>Bobby gets home as fast as he can and explains what happened to his parents. His Father tells him what they have to get him out of there but the police show up while he's packing. The police take him away, promising to keep him safe. But while he waits in a cell, a mob forms outside. Cyclops comes to the rescue, blasting his way into the jail. Bobby refuses to go with him, and Cyclops tries to knock him out with an optic blast for his own good. They struggle, and Bobby freezes him, but Cyke is able to free himself.

            "description": "<i>New York Times bestselling author Kevin Baker (Dreamland) writes his first original graphic novel, with internationally acclaimed artist Danijel Zezelj. Alik Strelnikov lives in the shadow of Coney Island, a world of silenced rides and rusting amusement parks that mock his dreams of becoming a hero. Ten years ago, he traded a brutal existence in the Russian army for the promise of America only to become an enforcer in the Brooklyn mob. Now, he chases his ghosts with all he has left: booze, heroin and his lover, Marina, part-time prostitute and full-time fortune teller. The only way the two of them can escape their miserable fates hinges on a desperate plan that will put them between warring mobs and span a century, from contemporary Coney Island to the Russia of the Second Chechen War to spellbinding 1910s New York. Mixing historical novel, immigrant fiction and crime thriller, LUNA PARK marks Kevin Baker's return to Coney Island, the setting of his critically beloved Dreamland and features breathtaking art by Danijel Zezelj (LOVELESS) with to-die-for colors by Dave Stewart (DC: THE NEW FRONTIER).</i>",

The powers send Mimic and Omega spinning out of control – Mimic glimpsing his future, and Omega feeding off of the powers as he careens through town, exploding.</p><p>Dark Beast drugs Mimic so he can focus on corralling Omega while he and Mystique stay behind at the hospital. The energy crackling around their patient begins to form into a shape and a voice. As it resolves to a humanoid shape, it sees Mystique in Jean's form and says, “mother, it's been so long...”</p><p>Dark Beast catches on just before the energy resolves to a human body – it is Nathan Grey, the Age of Apocalypse version of Cable, back in human form! </p>",

            "description": "<i>SUPERGOD: praying to be saved by a man who can fly will get you killed. From the creator of THE AUTHORITY and PLANETARY comes the craziest and most horrifying superhero comic you've ever read! In the world of SUPERGOD, superhumans are the ultimate expression of the Messiah complex, and scientists can build Messiahs who will fly down from the skies to save the world. No-one thought about how they'd do it -- or even if they'd want to. So begins the apocalyptic tomorrow of SUPERGOD -- the story of how supermen killed us all and ended the world just because we wanted to be rescued by human-shaped things from beyond Science itself!

            "description": "<i>After graduating from college, Lori returns home only to lose her parents in a fire. In the wake of this tragedy, unusual events begin to unfold, starting with the discovery of a girl named Priscilla Fairmount in an old high school yearbook who looks just like Lori. But the yearbook is from before Lori was born! Now suspected by the police for being involved in the fire, Lori begins a descent into madness, convinced that her \"twin,\" Priscilla, is attempting to take over her mind... unaware of the brutal role she herself may be playing in the events which now shape her fate. From Robert Bloch  (<em>Psycho)</em> , the master of American horror, <em>Lori</em>  is a cerebral and terrifying read.  </i>",

            "description": "<p><i>Can the man from the Meta Zone make sense of America? SHADE, THE CHANGING MAN: THE AMERICAN SCREAM TP collects the first six issues of one of VERTIGO's founding titles, written by Peter Milligan (HUMAN TARGET: FINAL CUT, X-Force) with art by Chris Bachalo (DEATH: THE HIGH COST OF LIVING, STEAMPUNK) and Mark Pennington (HELLBLAZER, DEATH: THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE) and a cover by Brendan McCarthy (2000 A.D.). And with the VERTIGO X ANNIVERSARY PREVIEW released the same month featuring the first new Shade story in years, now is the perfect time to rediscover this quixotic and timeless character.<br/><br/>This fantastic re-imagining of Shade, The Changing Man — a character created by the legendary Steve Ditko (Amazing Spider-Man) in the 1970s — begins in an explosion of madness as 23-year-old Kathy George relives the horror her parents' deaths. Hoping for a reprieve from the constant nightmares and the ever-present threat of insanity that have hounded her since their deaths, Kathy instead is swept up in Shade's arrival from his home dimension, Meta, into the body of the serial killer who destroyed her life. From there, Kathy and Shade begin a journey into America's collective unconscious as they combat the malevolent force known only as The American Scream.</i></p>",

For the past few years, Matt Murdock's life has been teetering on the edge of destruction. Now, pushed beyond the limit, he finds himself behind the eight ball with no clear way out, the people he calls friends slowly deserting him, and Hell's Kitchen gradually slipping out of control. The question is, when his back is against the wall, just how far will Daredevil go to get back what is his? And if you think Matt's life is going to start getting simpler after that, think again! As he tries to find a way to move forward, a threat from his past begins to creep toward daylight. And with the post-Civil War fallout all around him, he finds himself fighting a battle on both fronts of his life: in the courtroom and on the rooftops of Hell's Kitchen! Nominated for three Eisner Awards - Best Continuing Series, Best Writer and Best Penciler-Inker Team!</em></p><p>Reprints Daredevil (vol. 2) #82-105.</p>",

Would our heroes still have won the day? Or would Earth embrace the Skrull way of life? In other words, “WHAT IF THE SKRULLS WON?” Illustrations by hot newcomer Pow Rodrix (Justice League America) with digital paints by Jelena Kevic-Djurdjevic (TERROR INC.). The second story presents a twilight zone take on the question, “WHAT IF THE SECRET INVASION STAYED SECRET?” by newcomer Chris Acosta with art by Larry Stroman (X-FACTOR) and Carl Potts (Alien Legion). Plus a “SAY WHAT?” comedy strip by Mike Gallagher (Mad Magazine) and Dave Manak (Spy Vs. Spy).</em></p>",

With DAYTRIPPER, they follow in the tradition of Craig Thompson, Paul Pope and David Mazzucchelli – cartoonists at the top of their game making comics about the quiet moments that ask big questions.<br /><br />Brás de Oliva Domingos is an obituary writer with a famous father, a career he hates, and tons of questions. How does a person become a successful writer? How does a man get out of his father's shadow? But those concerns will dwarf the surprise he'll find in the first issue – a twist both he and readers will never see coming, which will grow into a mystery about the meaning of life itself.</i>",

Who could possibly benefit from such a catastrophe? We'll give you a hint, it's not the Hulk... but they're green, too. WHAT IF THE HEROES LOST WORLD WAR HULK? In the second feature, a vengeful Hulk and his Warbound began routing Earth’s super heroes, confident no one could stop him from dispensing his gladiatorial brand of justice. But in this alternate telling of the story, the recently returned God of Thunder hammers out a different conclusion in “WHAT IF THOR PARTICIPATED IN WORLD WAR HULK? by Michael Gallagher (GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) and SPAZ!

            "description": "<i>It is the 1950s, the age of the Cold War and nuclear science. Parting the curtain to expose old-world myths and urban legends is showman-scientist and myth buster Dr. Randolph Stein, who embarks on a quest to find the lost explorer Marlowe and disprove the existence of the legendary underwater city of Atlantis. Traveling deep beneath the ocean's surface on the submarine Plato, Stein is confronted by the growing threat of mutiny within his superstitious crew, and by a series of horrific and unexplainable events that test his resolve and his rational, scientific mind. Nothing can prepare Stein for what he finds - a scene of carnage that suggests the legend of Atlantis just might be true, and that its protector, the dreaded Sub-Mariner, will do anything to prevent its discovery. To survive the awful black waters of the depths, Stein is forced to question everything he stands for. Writer Peter Milligan and painter Esad Ribic bring you the psychological drama of this unknown world, where men go mad and a mysterious man-like figure haunts the depths. Collecting SUB-MARINER: THE DEPTHS #1-5</i>",

Long ago, he was trained as a samurai in Japan; later, he became Weapon X, a covert operative for the Canadian government. Today, Wolverine is an X-Man -- using his animal-keen senses, accelerated healing factor and razor-sharp claws to help protect a world that fears and hates mutants! Always an outsider, Gambit was shunned as a youth because of his strange, burning-red eyes. Eventually, Remy LeBeau realized he was a mutant, possessed of the ability to charge inanimate objects with explosively released biokinetic energy. A reformed thief and charming scoundrel, the ragin' Cajun always has a card up his sleeve! Now, these two outlaw heroes have been drawn together by a string of brutal slayings that may mark the return of the 19th-century serial killer called Jack the Ripper! Is it merely coincidence that finds Remy and Logan in London, or does one of these enigmatic outsiders have an ulterior motive?</em></p>",

Beginning this month, with the debut of</i> <i>Happy Valley #1 (of 3), featuring art by Paul Jason Holden and series covers by Garry Leach!</i> <i>England, January 1942: young Australian Ken Harding arrives at his first operational squadron, keen to play his part in the aerial attack on Germany as the commander of a bomber crew. Losses have been high and life expectancy is low, but Ken remains undaunted--until he meets his crew, a foulmouthed, battle-hardened bunch with no time for new boys who can't stand the pace. Together, they must take the war to the enemy over the most heavily-defended region of the Third Reich--the industrial heartland of the Ruhr, known to the men who face the flak and nightfighters as Happy Valley.</i></p>",

Love and War is a story full of action and unbridled humor, with Herc just the way you like — no, love — him. Charming, dumb and getting away with it!

            "description": "<p><i>The enduring cultural phenomenon of comic book heroes was invented in the late 1930s by a talented and hungry group of artists and writers barely out of their teens, flying by the seat of their pants to create something new, exciting, and above all profitable. The iconography and mythology they created flourishes to this day in comic books, video, movies, fine art, advertising, and practically all other media. <b>Supermen!</b> collects the best and the brightest of this first generation, including Jack Cole, Will Eisner, Bill Everett, Lou Fine, Fletcher Hanks, Jack Kirby, Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, and Basil Wolverton. If the reader is expecting to find an All-American group of altruistic do-gooders, he in for quite a jolt. As Jonathan Lethem writes in his Foreword, “A collection like <b>Supermen!</b> works like a reverse-neutron bomb to assumptions about the birth of the superhero image: it tears down the orderly structures of theory and history and leaves the figures standing in full view, staring back at us in all their defiant disorienting particularity, their blazing strangeness.” Beautifully designed and produced in full color, <b>Supermen!</b> contains twenty full-length stories, ten full-sized covers, a generous selection of vintage promotional ads, and comprehensive end notations by editor Greg Sadowski, making it indispensable to anyone interested in the origins of superheroes and the history of the comic book form.</i></p>",

Learn the legend of the Highwayman, the hellbilly terror of the hammer lane - a former trucker who was cursed by the devil and now drives a mystical black rig, preying on the souls of anyone foolish enough to drive his highways. See what happens when Johnny Blaze tries to get away from it all in a sleepy fishing village in Japan, where the locals have some demons of their own. And welcome to Mercy, Idaho, a small town in the hills with more than its fair share of secrets: a winged terror that haunts the woods; an irresistible pull on the desperate and the suicidal; and now a stranger on a low-slung chopper, with fire in his eyes. For Johnny Blaze, searching for a way to wage war against heaven itself, the frozen forests of Mercy might just provide a path through the Pearly Gates.</em></p><p>Reprints Ghost Rider #33-35 and Ghost Rider Annual #2.</p>",

And so was the Goblin. A master at turning hopelessness into a commodity, the corrupt mob boss led a colorful gang of circus sideshow freaks - including the cannibalistic Vulture - in a corrupt stranglehold on the city. Peter Parker came of age during this time of struggle and hardship. Raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, two stemwinding Socialists committed to positive change for the people, Peter would have been a boyish beacon of optimism in any other era. But in this world of noir, he was an embittered, angry young man on the search for justice. And then along came a spider.

Responding to their Shakespearean pathos and Kirby's out of this world character designs, the fans loved them - and wanted more! The mysterious origins of Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Triton, Karnak and the rest of their wondrous, secret world was initially revealed in a series of <em>Thor</em> features.</i></p><p><i>But that only whetted reader's appetites - and so came their first headlining series in <em>Amazing Adventures</em>! Launched by writer/artist Jack Kirby, the new series took the Inhumans to their roots, defending their kingdom against the aggressions of mankind - especially against the ultimate threat of the Mandarin.</i></p><p><i>Then a team with uncanny credentials, Roy Thomas and Neal Adams, took up the crown and sent the Inhumans on a mythical exodus into the world of man. It was a saga exploring the social issues of the era and, of course, topped of with a heavy dose of Inhuman action! Also featuring a rare Medusa and Black Bolt tale from Marvel Super-Heroes and a trio of satirical tales from Not Brand Echh by Stan, Jack and their blushing Bullpen!</i></p><p><i>Collecting <em>Thor</em> issues #146 to 152, <em>Amazing Adventures</em> #1 to 10, <em>The Avengers</em> #95 and <em>Marvel Super-Heroes</em> #15 with bonus selections from <em>Not Brand Ecch</em> #6 &amp; 12, written by Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Roy Thomas, Gerry Conway and Archie Goodwin, penciled by Kirby, Neal Adams, Mike Sekowsky and Gene Colan; features cover artwork by Neal Adams.</i></p>",

In 1969, during their youth, they created a symbol. In 1997, as the coming disaster slowly starts to unfold, that symbol returns. This is the story of a group of boys who try to save the world.<br /><br />For Kenji, a simple convenience store manager who once dreamed of becoming a rock 'n' roll musician, a host of memories from his past come rushing back when one of his childhood friends mysteriously commits suicide. Could this new death be related to the rise of a bizarre new cult that's been implicated in several other murders and disappearances? Determined to dig deeper, Kenji reunites with some of his old buddies in the hope of learning the truth behind it all.</i> <br /><h2>Chapter Titles </h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Chap 01: Friends</li><li>Chap 02: Karaoke</li><li>Chap 03: The Boy Who Bought A Guitar</li><li>Chap 04: Snot Rag</li><li>Chap 05: Night in the Science Lab</li><li>Chap 06: Flag On the Moon</li><li>Chap 07: Softball</li><li>Chap 08: Digging A Hole</li><li>Chap 09: Message</li><li>Chap 10: Yukiji</li></ul>",

Berkeley Breathed's Bloom County burst onto the American comic scene in December 1980 and it soon became one of the most popular comic strips of all time. The endearing and quirky denizens of the strip included Milo Bloom, Steve Dallas, Michael Binkley, Cutter John, Bill the Cat, and Opus the penguin. Bloom County was a strip that dealt with many issues relevant to the period. Occasional 'Context Pages' are being added throughout this collection, giving the reader a greater understanding of the time. This is the first time Bloom County has been collected in a handsome hardcover library, five volumes in all. Each newspaper strip is reproduced in chronological order from first to last. Great effort has been made to ensure the highest production values are achieved. Most strips were either shot from printer's proofs or Breathed's own original art. This is the first of five volumes. Book design by Eisner Award-winning designer Dean Mullaney.</i></p>",

Then, the wordless “&amp;” tells two tales at once: one about a skinny guy trying to steal enough money to save his ill mother, and the other about a fat guy murderously trying to woo his true love. The reason we follow these two parallel stories becomes obvious only on the very last page, in Jason’s inimitable genre-mashing style.</i></p>",

There she will face Hohopah, the Heart of the Forest and be assigned her totem, the animal incarnation of her inner-self. But unbeknownst to Luuna, this night belongs to Unkui, the Evil One, who demands that her soul be shared! Now Luuna is cursed with not one, but two totems. One white--the reflection of all that is good in her. The other, black--representing the darkness that resides in us all, and capable of terrible destruction. Unable to return to her tribe, Luuna embarks on a quest to seek out the wise spirits of the earth and with their help, rid herself of the cursed totem. But little does she know that Unkui is not finished with her yet, and has set his fiendish minions on her trail...Sumptuous artwork and a fast-moving, whimsical tale of one girl's mystical adventure of a lifetime illustrate just why Luuna has become one of Europe's most popular graphic novels!</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter One: Night of the Totems</li><li>Chapter Two: Twilight of the Lynx</li></ul>",

Now, art historian and living pinup legend Jim Silke casts his curatorial eye toward Maguire's long and fascinating career in his first art collection/artist biography, With a keen eye for criticism and his trademark style and wit, Silke explores the legacy of an artist whose work is known by millions the world over.</i></p>",

In 1947, artist Jesse Marsh left Walt Disney Studios-where he had worked on Pinocchio, Fantasia, and various animated shorts -- to work for Western Publishing full time. Tarzan was one of his first assignments, with the iconic character's first original comic-book appearance in Dell Four-Color Comics#134. Tarzan #2 would begin Marsh's long-term collaboration with writer Gaylord DuBois. Their terrific work drew admiration and respect from readers and peers -- Russ Manning among them -- and Marsh's art inspired future comics creators from Richard Corben to Los Bros. Hernandez!</i></p>",

But before he can reach out and grab it...his mother is shaking him awake for another day of work. A You’s not exactly thrilled with his job at the factory, so when a persistent streak of bad luck leaves him unemployed, it seems like a great opportunity to start over. The trouble is, A You doesn’t have anything to move on to. With no goals or aspirations, A You roams the city searching for direction. Deep in thought on one of his strolls, A You suddenly rouses himself only to discover he’s lost in the woods. He catches sight of a rabbit, and in desperation follows it through the forest. But this scene seems familiar...  Is it a dream? Or could there truly be an ideal world within the darkness?</i>",

As the new head of S.H.I.E.L.D. and creator of the nationwide Initiative program, he's rebuilding the Avengers with a handpicked roster of Earth's mightiest heroes: Wasp, Black Widow, Wonder Man, Sentry, Ares and new team leader Ms. Marvel. A group this powerful should be ready for just about anything — except, perhaps, the return of genocidal killing machine Ultron. The Avengers' insane robotic foe has rebuilt himself yet again, this time in the form of…a beautiful woman!? Then, the team faces an even bigger threat when their outlaw ex-teammate Spider-Woman shows up with evidence that shape-shifting Skrulls have infiltrated Earth. Iron Man faces a harrowing dilemma: Who can he trust when any one of his allies might be an undetectable alien invader? There's no time to figure it out, though, when a bio-weapon transforms New York's populace into Venom-like monsters. Plus: the New Avengers, a time-travel quest and an earth-shaking confrontation with Doctor Doom! Collecting Mighty Avengers #1-11.</em></p>",

The flame is fanned as Sinister’s agents, the Marauders, attack Madelyne’s protectors in the X-Men, while a horde of N’astirh’s demons prey upon the helpless, horrified populace of New York City. The inferno burns as Madelyne strikes her own bargain with N’astirh, and as the Goblin Queen, threatens to cast a spell that would render the entire earth a hellish wasteland where demons rule. And the sacrifice necessary is none other than her own innocent child, Nathan Christopher Summers! It’s the X-Men, X-Factor, and the New Mutants in one of their most harrowing ordeals ever, with the fate of entire dimensions hanging in the balance — and the price for victory perhaps higher than any of them can bear! Collecting X-FACTOR #33-40, X-TERMINATORS #1-4, UNCANNY X-MEN #239-243, NEW MUTANTS #71-73 and X-FACTOR ANNUAL #4.</em></p>",

Gaining independence after decades of civil disobedience and anarchist bombings, the Socialist Republic of Britain is now a small, unimportant backwater connected by a railway bridge, steam-powered dirigible, and mutual suspicion to France. When a British diplomat's murder is made to look like suicide, ferocious Detective-Inspector LeBrock of Scotland Yard stalks a ruthless murder squad through the heart of a Belle Epoque Paris, the center of the greatest empire in a world of steam-driven hansom cabs, automatons, and flying machines. LeBrock's relentless quest can lead only to death, truth . . . or war.</i></p><p>When British diplomat Raymond Leigh-Otter is murdered in the tiny village of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82213\" href=\"/rupert-the-bear/4005-82213/\">Nutwood</a>, Scotland Yard <a data-ref-id=\"4005-82225\" href=\"/inspector-lebrock/4005-82225/\">Detective Inspector LeBrock</a> finds the case taking him to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56052\" href=\"/paris/4020-56052/\">Paris</a>, the world's largest and most opulent city a.k.a.

Inspired by the work of the nineteenth-century French illustrator Gérard, who worked under the pseudonym 'Grandville' and frequently drew anthropomorphic animal characters, it tells the story of detective Inspector LeBrock of Scotland Yard as he stalks a gang of murderers through the heart of Belle Epoque Paris. In this alternative reality France is the major world power and its capital is thronged with steam-driven hansom cabs, automatons and flying machines. The characters are mostly animals, though there is an underclass of humans, often referred to as 'dough faces', who resemble the 'clear-line' characters of <a data-ref-id=\"4040-45908\" href=\"/herge/4040-45908/\">Hergé's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17079\" href=\"/tintin/4005-17079/\">Tintin</a> books.</p><p>Visually stunning, <i>Grandville</i> is a fantastical and audacious rollercoaster ride that will add to Talbot's reputation as one of the best graphic novelists in the world.</p>",

After being friends since childhood, dog-like Junya and cat-like Atsu now attend college together. One day, Junya finally drops a bomb: he’s in love with Atsu and wants to have a sexual relationship with him! Even though Atsu agrees, he doesn’t tell Junya if his feelings are returned. Aren’t they both supposed to be in love? What’s more, aren’t dogs and cats supposed to be natural enemies?</em></p><p><em>In Dog x Cat, creator Yoshimi Amasaki demonstrates the funny side of animalistic first love. With lots of training, perhaps Atsu will come to learn that having Junya is even better than having his own pet!</em></p>",

A  president, of course, needs a running mate – and just like that, Kokusai  appoints Chiga to be his vice-president! How did a slowpoke  upperclassman like Kokusai win an election, anyway?! Sure, he does seem  to have an almost uncanny ability to attract stalkers, peeping toms and  other degenerates, but Kokusai’s so helpless he can barely take care of  himself, let alone a student body. It quickly becomes clear that Chiga’s  major vice-presidential duty will be to keep Kokusai out of harm’s way,  but is he up to the task? Furthermore, will all the time they have to  spend together in student government cause Chiga himself to fall under  Kokusai’s spell?</i>",

            "description": "<p><i>Rand Holmes was Canada’s most revolutionary artist in his heyday, the star cartoonist at the Georgia Straight newspaper in British Columbia during the 1970s. His hippie hero, Harold Hedd, became the spokesman of the emerging counterculture as he avoided work, explored free love, and flouted drug laws. The Adventures of Harold Hedd spread across the globe in the wave of underground comix and newspapers of the era and Holmes became famous — or at least notorious. While his comic character was bold and blatant, the artist was shy and quiet, well on his way to becoming a complete hermit.</i></p><p><i>This book is an intimate and expansive account of a very private man who expressed his deepest feelings in the then disreputable medium of comix. “He didn’t talk much but he sure wrote a lot,” avowed his widow Martha. This biography/retrospective includes generous selections from his private journals and correspondence, family photo albums, sketchbooks, and personal anecdotes from his friends and colleagues. His artistic history began haltingly on the lonely windswept plateau of Edmonton, flourished in Vancouver and San Francisco, and concluded peacefully on Lasqueti Island, a remote backwater in the Straits of Georgia where he lived out his dreams of pioneering and homesteading.</i></p><p><i>Holmes’ life story is richly illustrated with drawings, comic strips, watercolors, and paintings that span his whole career, from the hot rod cartoons he drew as a teenager, dozens of covers for the Georgia Straight, pornographic cartoons for the sex tabloid Vancouver Star, to complete comic stories from Slow Death Funnies, Dope Comix, All Canadian Beaver, Death Rattle, Grateful Dead Comix, and many more. The full-length Harold Hedd comic novels,Wings Over Tijuana and Hitler’s Cocaine are reprinted in their entirety together for the first time. This unique collection of art documents a lifetime of work by one of the most talented artists of his generation.</i></p><p><i>Holmes died in March 2002 from Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and his ashes are buried next to the Art Centre he helped build on Lasqueti Island. A retrospective exhibition of his original work was held five years later at the community hall.</i></p><p><i>Author Patrick Rosenkranz met Holmes in his salad days and remained in touch throughout his life. The Holmes family gave him complete access to their art collection and personal files, and encouraged him to tell the whole truth about Rand Holmes’ life and work.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Before the Amazing Spider-Man, before the mysterious Dr. Strange, before the black-and-white world of the Ayn Rand-inspired Mr. A, the legendary comic book artist Steve Ditko was conjuring all manners of horrors at his drawing table. In his first two years in the industry (1953 and 1954), Ditko drew tales of macabre suspense that were not yet hobbled by the imminent Comics Code Authority (adopted in Oct. 1954). These stories featured graphic bloodshed, dismemberment and blood-curdling acid baths as the ugly end to the lives of the dark and twisted inhabitants of Steve Ditko’s imagination.</i></p><p><i>Following up on <b>Strange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko</b>, Blake Bell’s 2008 best-selling critical retrospective of Ditko’s career, <b>Strange Suspense: The Steve Ditko Archives Vol. 1</b> features, for the first time, spectacular full-color reprints of every story from those first two years of his career. Beginning with Ditko’s very first story to Ditko’s short stint in the Joe Simon/Jack Kirby studio, to Ditko’s eventual encampment at the Charlton Comics operation in 1954, readers will see the initial works of an artist already at a level of craftsmanship that exceeded most of his peers. The book also features editor Bell’s insightful introduction, providing historical background and speaking to Ditko's influence and his unique craft.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>MAP OF MY HEART celebrates the twentieth anniversary of John Porcellino's seminal and influential comics zine, KING CAT COMICS, which he started self publishing in 1989 and which has been his predominant means of expression. In this collection, while Porcellino is living in isolation and experiencing the pain of divorce he crafts a melancholic, tender graphic ballad of heartbreak and reflection. Known for his sad, quiet honesty rendered in his signature deceptively minimalist style, Porcellino has a command of graphic storytelling as sophisticated as the medium's more visually intricate masters. Few other artists are able to so expertly contemplate the sadness, beauty, and wonder of life in so few lines.</i></p>",

It tells the story of the 50-something author’s relationship with her World War II veteran father, and how his war experience shaped her childhood and affected her relationships in adulthood. “You’ll Never Know” refers not only to the title of her parents’ courtship song from that era, but also to the many challenges the author encountered in uncovering the difficult and painful truths about her Dad’s service — challenges exacerbated by her own tumultuous family life.</i></p><p><i><b>You’ll Never Know</b> is Tyler’s first first full-fledged graphic novel (after two volumes of short stories). Unlike many other graphic memoirs which have opted for simple, stylized drawings and limited color or black and white, <b>You’ll Never Know</b> makes full use of Tyler’s virtuosity as a cartoonist: stunningly rendered in detailed inks and subtle watercolors, it plunges the reader headlong into the diverse locales: her father’s wartime experiences and courtship, her own childhood and adolescence, and contemporary life. The unique landscape format, and the lush variety of design choices and rendering techniques, make perusing <b>You’ll Never Know</b> like reading a family album — but one with a strong, compelling, sharply told story.</i></p><p><i><b>You’ll Never Know</b>’s release schedule and format emulate those of Chris Ware’s <b>Acme Novelty Library</b>: three beautifully designed, large-format hardcover volumes released annually to complete a trilogy of astonishing breadth, depth, and sensitivity.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>OVER ONE THOUSAND CARTOONS SPANNING 50 YEARS OF A LEGENDARY CAREER</i></p><p><i>Fifty-one, to be exact, but let’s not quibble. Gahan Wilson is among the most popular, widely-read, and beloved cartoonists in the history of the medium, whose career spans the 2nd half of the 20th century, and all of the 21st. His work has been seen by millions — no, hundreds of millions — in the pages of <b>Playboy</b>, <b>The New Yorker</b>, <b>Punch</b>, <b>The National Lampoon</b>, and many other magazines; there is no telling, really, how many readers he has corrupted or comforted. He is revered for his playfully sinister take on childhood, adulthood, men, women, and monsters. His brand of humor makes you laugh until you cry. And it’s about time that a collection of his cartoons was published that did justice to his vast body of work.</i></p><p><i>When Gahan Wilson walked into Hugh Hefner’s office in 1957, he sat down as Hefner was on the phone, gently rejecting a submission to his new gentlemen’s magazine: “I think it’s very well-written and I liked it very much,” Hefner reportedly said, “but it’s anti-sin. And I’m afraid we’re pro-sin.” Wilson knew, at that moment, that he had found a kindred spirit and a potential home for his cartoons. And indeed he had; Wilson appeared in every issue of Playboy from the December 1957 issue to today. It has been one of the most fruitful, successful, and long-lived relationships between a contributor and a magazine, ever.</i></p><p><i><b>Gahan Wilson: 50 Years of Playboy Cartoons</b> features not only every cartoon Wilson drew for <b>Playboy</b>, but all his prose fiction that has appeared in that magazine as well, from his first story in the June, 1962 issue, “Horror Trio,” to such classics as “Dracula Country” (September 1978). It also includes the text-and-art features he drew for <b>Playboy</b>, such as his look at Madame Tussaud’s Wax Museum, his take on our country’s “pathology of violence,” and his appreciation of “transplant surgery.”</i></p><p><i>Wilson’s notoriously black sense of comedy is on display throughout the book, leaving no sacred cow unturned (an image curiously absent in the book), ridiculing everything from state sponsored executions to the sober precincts of the nouveau rich, from teenage dating to police line-ups, with scalding and hilarious satirical jabs. Although Wilson is known as an artist who relishes the creepy side of modern life, this three-volume set truly demonstrates the depth and breadth of his range — from illustrating private angst we never knew we had (when you eat a steak, just whom are you eating?) to the ironic and deadpan take on horrifying public issues (ecological disaster, nuclear destruction anyone?).</i></p><p><i>Gahan Wilson has been peeling back the troubling layers of modern life with his incongruously playful and unnerving cartoons, assailing our deepest fears and our most inane follies. This three-volume set is a testament to one of the funniest — and wickedly disturbing — cartoonists alive.</i></p>",

In fact, the Lulu work is a small part of his output, he had drawn and continued to write many other comics — notably his work on the 1960s teen comics from Dell (Thirteen Going on Eighteen, Dunc and Loo, andKookie) and his monster comedy strip Melvin Monster.</em></p><p><em>The three-volume Melvin Monster collection is pivotal to the John Stanley Library, featuring all nine issues of the oddball monster boy who just wants to be good, go to school, and do as he's told. Designed to fit nicely with our current reprinting of Tove Jansson's Moomin series, these comics are great reading for children or comics history-minded adults. Stanley's reputation as a great storyteller and visual comedian is richly deserved — few golden- or silver-age comics stand the test of time the way these comics do.</em></p>",

(Such was its popularity that today, decades after Foster’s death, it continues to run under different hands.)</i></p><p><i>The giant Sunday-funnies pages (<b>Valiant</b> ran only on Sundays) gave Foster a huge canvas upon which he was able to limn epic swordfights, stunning scenes of pomp and pageantry, and some of the most beautiful human beings — male and female — ever to appear in comics. And he matched his nonpareil visual sense with the narrative instincts of a born storyteller, propelling his daring young hero from one crisis to another with barely a panel to catch one’s breath.</i></p><p><i><b>Prince Valiant</b> has previously been widely available only in re-colored, somewhat degraded editions (now out of print and fetching collectors’ prices). Thanks to advances in production technology and newly available original proof sheets, this new series from the industry leader in quality strip classics is the first to feature superb restored artwork that captures every delicate line and chromatic nuance of Foster’s original masterpiece. Comic strip aficionados will be ecstatic, and younger readers who enjoy a classic adventure yarn will be bowled over.</i></p><p><i>Volume One is rounded out with a rare, in-depth classic Foster interview previously available only in a long out-of-print issue of <b>The Comics Journal</b>, as well as an informative Afterword detailing the production and restoration of this edition, which you can read in its entirety right here on our website.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Out of print for over a decade, <b>The Prince Valiant Companion</b> has become a Holy Grail for collectors of the series. Now, in anticipation of the seventy-fifth anniversary of comics’ longest-running adventure strip, and to celebrate our own just-launched reprinting of the strip’s classic earliest years, Fantagraphics is proud to present an expanded version of this hard-to-find collector’s item. Compiled by award-winning Foster biographer Brian M. Kane, <b>The Definitive Prince Valiant Companion</b> beautifully showcases the careers of artists Hal Foster, John Cullen Murphy, and Gary Gianni.</i></p><p><i>In addition to updating the original version’s story synopsis section with over thirty years of material, <b>The Definitive Prince Valiant Companion</b> also contains rare and new articles. Included in this volume is a never before reprinted newspaper feature from 1949, Foster’s final interview conducted by Arn Saba, an extensive interview with John Cullen Murphy, and a new interview with the current <b>Prince Valiant</b> creative team of Gary Gianni and Mark Schultz. The <b>Companion</b> also contains a new, in-depth article by Kane on Foster’s artistic influences, as well as a Foreword by comics historian Brian Walker, and an Introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ray Bradbury.</i></p><p><i>A special feature of the <b>Companion</b> is a sixteen-page color section of carefully selected strips from the entire run of the comic. Showcasing this section are eight pages by Foster, scanned and digitally restored from original color engraver’s proofs that had been carefully stored and preserved for over forty years. For the first time ever, collectors will be able to see <b>Prince Valiant</b> as Foster intended it to be seen, with all of his fine inked line work intact. Rounding out this section are four John Cullen Murphy pages from the Murphy family’s collection of proofs, and four Gary Gianni pages that were selected by the artist and digitally recolored under his supervision.</i></p><p><i>Proceeds from the sale of <b>The Definitive Prince Valiant Companion</b> will go to The Friends of Hal Foster Society to aid in the creation of the Prince Valiant statue in Foster’s birthplace of Halifax, Nova Scotia.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Dan Dare has made his Dynamite in this Hardcover Edition of the acclaimed series from writer Garth Ennis, artist Garry Erskine and featuring a cover by Dave (Watchmen) Gibbons! Dan Dare has been an icon since 1950. Elaborate stories of his space travel and galactic battles defending people of the universe captivated post-War baby boomers. Dan Dare's adventures burst to the forefront of pop culture, selling nearly 1 million copies each week in the pages of the Eagle Comic. And now he's back! \"Dan Dare is the quintessential British hero. He's our Captain America, our Superman, our Batman, he's all of them rolled into one. He's the original and the best.\" said Garth Ennis in the initial press release and the writer did the hero proud in one incredible series! Dan Dare is set in the future, albeit not too many decades from the present day. Colonel Dare is still vibrant and courageous - but now he's retired. His retirement is a self-imposed exile, the result of his disgust with politics and the post-nuclear warfare that has destroyed North America and much of Asia - leaving the UK as the world's last remaining superpower. Readers familiar with Dan Dare stories will recognize many of the original cast including a wiser and more experienced Digby; the innovative, brilliant and beautiful Professor Peabody; and of course the enemy of all that is good, the super-intelligent ruler of the Treens - The Mekon, together with a mix of galactic evil beings. The Dynamite Hardcover Edition will feature the complete Ennis series along with a complete cover gallery!</em></p><h3>Back Blurb</h3><p><em>Something tells me we'll show 'em a thing or two yet...</em></p><p><em>His country has forgotten him. The world he loved is gone forever. Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, has retired.</em></p><p><em>His beloved Space Fleet long-disbanded and his friends scattered to the winds, Dare lives far from home in self-imposed exile. But in the black depths of space, something ancient and terrible is stirring.  long-forgotten enemy is coming back, with an army of demonic beasts and a secret weapon that threatens reality itself.</em></p><p><em>The Mekon of Mekonta has returned.</em></p><p><em>And if the beleaguered citizens of Earth are to survive... they're going to need a hero.</em></p><p><em>Garth Ennis (The Boys) and Gary Erskine (Hypersonic) revisit the classic British comic character in an epic tale of courage and sacrifice, as old adversaries clash head-on and a battle is fought in the stars to decide the fate of billions.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Adrian Tomine's first book, 32 Stories, collects his inaugural mini-comics in a special, redesigned edition. This one-time printing includes facsimile reprints of the seven mini-comics packaged in a slipcase, as well as an additional pamphlet containing a new introduction and notes by Tomine. Between the ages of seventeen and twenty, Adrian Tomine self-published a series of 'mini-comics': small, hand-assembled booklets that he wrote, drew, and distributed himself. Entitled Optic Nerve, these comics were comprised of short vignettes and stories which displayed a youthful energy, an unabashed sense of experimentation, and the first hints of the distinctive, realist style that Tomine would go on to perfect. This special edition of 32 Stories presents those rare, early mini-comics for the first time in archival facsimile form: all seven issues in their entirety, faithfully reproduced and collected in one box.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>May 28, 1828, marked the beginning of the official life of Kaspar Hauser, a young man who appeared mysteriously in the streets of Nuremberg and died of knife wounds five years later under equally mysterious circumstances. 'Europe's child,' as pamphleteers referred to him, captured the imagination of salon society. Allegedly raised in a dark cellar and deprived of human contact until the age of sixteen, he became the proof of a concept for theories about natural man, original sin, and the civilizing mission of culture. Rightful heir to the throne of Baden or a fraud? Redeemer of man's sins or 'ambulatory automatist'? The curious circumstances and significance of his life have been disputed ever since. Quebec cartoonist Diane Obomsawin draws on Hauser's own writings, and contemporary accounts, to tell the foundling's strange story.Gentle and poetic, naïve and profound, Obomsawin's first book to appear in English translation has a quiet and compelling charm.</em></p>",

But there's more than just water standing between Shanks and his goal: he'll have to contend with circus performers, adorable orphans, heinous villains, bitter ex-lovers, well-meaning undergraduates, and the full might of the Royan Canadian Arctic Navy! Not to mention he's not so sure how to get to Far Arden in the first place! Far Arden is an epic journey through a world not quite our own, written and drawn with strokes bold and swift. Thrilling, eccentric, lusty, genuinely moving, and often hilarious, this may be the best adventure comic you'll read all year.</em></p>",

For more than a century, Alice, Wendy, and Dorothy have been our guides through the Wonderland, Neverland, and the Land of Oz of our childhoods. Now like us, these three lost girls have grown up and are ready to guide us again, this time through the realms of our sexual awakening and fulfillment. Through their familiar fairy tales they share with us their most intimate revelations of desire in its many forms, revelations that shine out radiantly through the dark clouds of war gathering around a luxury Austrian hotel. Drawing on the rich heritage of erotica, Lost Girls is the rediscovery of the power of ecstatic writing and art in a sublime union that only the medium of comics can achieve. Exquisite, thoughtful, and human, Lost Girls is a work of breathtaking scope that challenges the very notion of art fettered by convention. This is erotic fiction at its finest.</em></p>",

The National Cartoonists Society named Tundra as the Best Newspaper Panel Cartoon of the Year in 2007. These are award-winning cartoons from a naturally wonderful place. A tour guide might overlook some of the more quirky aspects of Alaska, but Carpenter sees it in a completely different light (even if that light only shows itself part of the year). Carpenter gives nature's residents, the furry and the not-so-furry, full attention. He also gives them voices that can bring a tear of laughter to the eye. Tundra is full of talking snowmen, inept hunters, obsessed fishermen, and inviting wildlife looking for their next meal. It's also packed with an abundance of hilarity. Tundra: Nature's Favorite Comic Strip features a \"best of\" collection with 560 cartoons from over 16 years of syndication.</em></p>",

Set in a wacked-out world, Center City is the belly-button lint of surviving society, a final human outpost oozing crime and tension between man and machine. Against this backdrop, comicdom's most unique anti-heroes, Cholly and Flytrap, find themselves knee-deep in a mucky feud between the city's two power brokers: the Siamese-twin Hobbs Brothers and paranoid paraplegic millionaire Ameil Luvitz. When sumo-master Flytrap is mistakenly shanghaied and forced into slavery in a secret fight world, his partner Cholly's odyssey to rescue him from certain doom begins. A groundbreaking and compelling epic told by the ultimate storyteller!</em></p>",

There is turmoil in the 5th century Celtic periphery of Europe; an age of change at the end of the Roman Empire, and an age of conflict between peoples and religions. Oppressed by Saxons to the east, many of the Celts of Britain have colonised Armorica in Gaul, bringing with them the spiritual leaders of their Celtic Church, the monks. The new faith heralds the demise of the old pagan way of life, but the ancient traditions still hold on. Gwynlan, the last of the Druids, and his apprentice Taran are caught in a mysterious battle for survival against the monks of the church, monastic foes who place dangerous and menacing obstacles in their path. Accusations of murder, sacrifice and sorcery are rife, but the old gods are at hand to assist the righteous.</em></p><p>The last Druid Gwynlan and his apprentice Taren must call on the Old Gods to help stop the Christians from destroying the old pagan way of life.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>AN EXPERIMENTAL COLLECTION OF ART, HUMOR AND PHILOSOPHY Monologues for Calculating the Density of Black Holes takes up where the artist's first volume, Monologues for the Coming Plague, left off. Like Coming Plague, the Black Holes is a creatively experimental laboratory, comprising a collection of free flowing stream of consciousness gags, strips, and drawings that slowly coalesce into an unexpectedly compelling and complex narrative. The hints of story that came together in Monologues for The Coming Plague are extrapolated and expanded upon and grow to incorporate some of Nilsen's other outro strips from the anthology Mome, two of which are reprinted here in expanded form. The book is an audacious investigation into the rhythms of storytelling, the blurring of media, and an exercise in reconciling contrasts. It is playful, provacative and serious all at once - another tour de force by Anders Nilsen, impeccably and uniquely designed, in black and white and color.What Pedro Vieira de Moura on Ler BD wrote about Nilsen's Coming Plague could apply equally to The Density of Black Holes: 'What looks like last minute thoughts or doodles are actually something extremely pure... Monologues' first half feels like a successful game of tetris: each page is like a new 'brick,' which adds a new element of significance to the whole, and after a while we realize a whole new layer of meaning that changes everything we had learned up to that point.'</em></p>",

Drawn to drug abuse and endless partying, Shauna has become a mere shadow of her former self. Shauna now teeters on the edge of not only losing her life, but the previous life of her one and only son as well. Detective Robert Healy has become obsessed with finding out the secret behind the mysterious serial killer who covers his face in gauze. Finding out that little is known about the elusive murderer, Robert must search out and find the few that have encountered him and lived to tell their story. Nelson Shmeck is a low-level computer programmer for a popular video game company. A shy and timid young man, Nelson lacks all knowledge and wisdom when it comes to charming the opposite sex. Faced with this problem, Nelson must find a way to overcome the dilemma before the one girl he secretly loves is stolen away by another man. These three stories collide, and the lives of Shauna, Robert, and Nelson will never again be the same!</em></p>",

Melissa finds herself negotiating the kinds of everyday problems facing young adults today - such as alienating her friends with her uncomfortable honesty and accidentally breaking her best guy friend's heart. Eventually, her woes cause her to nearly flunk out of school, and by the end of the book Melissa faces the choice that we all do at some point: to take the risk and pursue her dreams or settle for a safer, more secure routine.</em></p><p><em>The unsentimental truthfulness that is the hallmark of Lasko-Gross's work is coupled with a raw but increasingly refined visual vocabulary. A Mess of Everything is an intense, honest, and funny memoir that holds appeal for anyone who is navigating, or who has ever grappled with, these issues. She expresses the awkward naïveté and inexperience of a young girl with the keen insights of a mature artist.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Mother, Come Home is Paul Hornschemeier's piercing graphic-novel debut. It secured the cartoonist's place as one of his generation's most skillful and ambitious practitioners; and proved a harbinger of the subject matter that the artist would go on to explore most consistently in later work: the nuclear family. Mother, Come Home quietly studies the inner lives of recently widowed David and his 7-year-old son, Thomas; both are unable to deal with their grief directly. Eisner-, Harvey-, and Ignatz-Award-nominated Hornschemeier's controlled brushwork is clean, and his nine-panel page layouts pace David's inexorable descent into utter despair. Hornschemeier is equally precise when it comes to Mother, Come Home's color palette: subdued but warm, which suits the story's melancholy and contemplative mode. Mother, Come Home is masterfully drawn; a powerful work with universal themes of anguish and loss.</em></p>",

Her fight will take her far, from the frontlines of the second American Civil War, to the cold, unforgiving reaches of space. She will be called a hero, a traitor, and nearly everything in between, but all along the way, her courage, her integrity, and her unwavering commitment to that most valuable of rights-liberty-will inspire a movement that will never surrender.</em></p><p><em><strong>The Life and Times of Martha Washington in the Twenty-first Century</strong> contains six hundred stunning pages of work from two of the top creators in comics!</em></p><p><em>Collecting remastered versions of every Martha Washington story and featuring the same extensive behind-the-scenes section by Dave Gibbons and introduction by Frank Miller as the hardcover edition.</em></p><p><em>The long-in-the-making life story of Martha Washington. A woman who has guts.</em></p><h4>Collects</h4><ul><li>Give Me Liberty</li><li>Martha Washington Goes to War</li><li>Happy Birthday Martha Washington</li><li>Martha Washington Stranded in Space</li><li>Martha Washington Dies</li></ul>",

On his third expedition to the mountain in June 1924, Mallory and his climbing partner, Andrew Irvine, disappeared on the North-East ridge during their ascent, having been sighted only a few hundred yards from the summit. In 1993, Makoto Fukumachi, photographer for a Japanese expedition, stumbles across an old Kodak camera. Could it be Mallory's camera? Did it hold the secret of whether Mallory and Irvine made it to the summit almost three decades ahead of Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing?</em></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 1: The Untrodden Summit</li><li>Chapter 2: City of Illusions</li><li>Chapter 3: Hungry Wolf</li><li>Chapter 4: Oni-Sura</li><li>Chapter 5: First Ascent</li><li>Chapter 6: A Strong Individual</li><li>Chapter 7: The Summit Wind</li><li>Chapter 8: Solo Climber</li></ul>",

The quality of his illustrations needed no explanation beyond that which was obvious at first glance: the sleekly stylized figure work, his masterful command of colors, and the layers and subtext that formed an essential part of his vision. It was a short trip from anonymity to his current status as one of Marvel's most compelling cover artists. This lush art book will feature a treasure trove of Marko's cover illustrations — plus sketches, designs and extensive discussion about the process that has made him one of Marvel's most popular artists. In collaboration with the artist himself, and with input from his peers, THE ART OF MARKO DJURDJEVIC will be the kind of deluxe art book you’ll be proud to show off to friends and fellow art fans. </em></p>",

Writer Jean-Francois Di Giorgio and artist Frédéric Genêt tap into the rich mythology of the noble Samurai, creating a nuanced look at the fabled Japanese warriors. Having become a samurai, Takeo feels strong enough to confront his past. On the borders of Japan, a terrible plan is being plotted: General Akuma, one of the Empire's most influential figures, seems to be dead set on betraying the Emperor to his own advantage. However, a grave secret links the two men: the 13th prophet. Meanwhile, Takeo hopes to discover who he is. Why did he grow up in a monastery? And why was he abandoned by his brother ten years earlier? His quest will put him in deep torment, placing him in the middle of the dark destiny of the Empire and the 13th prophet!</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>William Gravel carves a bloody path of death in his first full-color collection! Gravel Volume 1 features the first eight issues (#0-7) of this on-going series from Warren Ellis and co-writer Mike Wolfer with art by Raulo Caceres and Oscar Jimenez, as well as a special cover gallery! Long-buried and lost in antiquity, a unique book of magic once existed, filled with such extraordinary and arcane spells, supernatural rites, and inherent power that its possessor would be either unequaled, or driven irrevocably insane. Recently unearthed, the Sigsand Manuscript has been divided into six pieces and distributed among the Minor Seven, Britain's great Occult Detectives. With the Sigsand in their grasp, the Seven now wield more power than they were ever meant to possess - and William Gravel is not happy about it. Once a member of their Order but unceremoniously replaced within their ranks, the SAS Sergeant Major and Combat Magician is on a mission of revenge, redemption, and quite possibly rebirth, as he takes on the members of the Minor Seven one-by-one. And God help each of Gravel's former colleagues should they decide not to relinquish their sections of the Sigsand to the one man who might have the supernatural skills and restraint to use the reconstituted manuscript without accidentally destroying the Earth in the process. They all promised to use the unholy power wisely, but Gravel knows they are all Bloody Liars! Available in a standard Softcover and a limited edition Hardcover, of just 1,500 copies, both with all-new covers by Oscar Jimenez.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>This second color volume of Warren Ellis' and Mike Wolfer's on-going adventures of Combat Magician William Gravel is now available, collecting issues 8 through 14 of the series. After carving a bloody path through his fellow members of the Minor Seven, the last thing Sergeant Major William Gravel expected was to be welcomed with open arms into a much more prestigious ensemble: The Major Seven. But enlistment as the newest recruit among the Master Magicians of England comes with a price, and a penance. Before Gravel can fully gain acceptance within their ranks, the Major Seven have two tasks for him. The first, to reform the Minor Seven, whom he personally crushed with his own hands. The second, to uncover the murderer within the Major Seven who killed one of their own, the woman whose place Gravel will fill if he completes his inaugural assignments. Trouble is, the six remaining members of the Major Seven are just like the Minor Seven, a pack of bloody liars. And before he's done, the seasoned Combat Magician will make it very clear to the overseers of Britain's occult hierarchy that a penance, and a price, is not only his burden to endure. This second collection features and all-new cover by Mike Wolfer and is also available as a Hardcover edition with an exclusive cover by series artist Mike Wolfer that is limited to just 2000 copies.</em></p>",

This remarkably touching and funny graphic novel tells the first-person account of Tammy’s sophomore year in 1985, from the first day of school to winter break. Her hopes, dreams, agonies and defeats are brought to vivid, comedic life by Watson’s lovingly grotesque drawings, filled with all the eighties essentials — too much mascara, leg warmers with heels and huge hair — as well as timeless teen concerns like acne, dandruff, and the opposite sex (or same sex, in some cases).</em></p><p><em>In the epic saga that is <strong>Unlovable</strong>, Tammy finds herself dealing with: tampons, teasing, crushes, The Smiths, tube socks, facial hair, lice, celibacy, fantasy dream proms, gym showers, skid marks, a secret admirer, prank calls, backstabbers, winter ball, barfing, narcs, breakdancing, hot wheels, glamour shots, roller coasters, Halloween costumes, boogers, boys, boy crazy feelings, biker babes, and even some butt cracks. Tammy’s life isn’t pretty, but it is endlessly charming and hilarious.</em></p><p><em>Originally (and still) serialized in <strong>Bust</strong> magazine, <strong>Unlovable</strong> includes over 100 new pages created just for this edition, which is handsomely packaged in a unique hot pink hardcover format with sparkly blue glitter that would make Tammy proud.</em></p>",

Wandering from town to town with just his horse, cart, and whatever wares have come his way, the peddler has pretty well settled into his routine—that is, until the night Lawrence finds a wolf goddess asleep in his cart. Taking the form of a fetching girl with wolf ears and a tail, Holo has wearied of tending to harvests in the countryside and strikes up a bargain with the merchant to lend him the cunning of “Holo the Wisewolf” to increase his profits in exchange for taking her along on his travels. What kind of businessman could turn down such an offer? Lawrence soon learns, though, that having an ancient goddess as a traveling companion can be a bit of a mixed blessing. Will this wolf girl turn out to be too wild to tame?</em></p>",

He believes marriage only drains your bank account, and only contributes to charity to evade taxes. While investigating a charity, he meets a poor but charming girl named Amy. However their encounter is cut short when he suddenly coughs up blood and collapses. Amy rushes him to the hospital and while drifting between the borders of life and death, he had a dream: his friends standing at his bed side, sadly mumbling \"he only thought of money, money, money\", \"he never learnt to love anyone\". Justin is suddenly swamped with a feeling of deep regret. He prays to God, \"please, just give me another chance!\"</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>During the 1950s, Abe Goodman  brother of Marvel Comics publisher Martin Goodman  was the largest buyer of cartoons in the world. Publishing out of New York City under the Humorama banner, Goodman churned out scores of cheap digest-sized magazines boasting inventive titles like <strong>Romp</strong>, <strong>Stare</strong> and <strong>Joker</strong> that featured hackneyed jokes, cheesecake photos and the publications bread and butter, single panel pin-up cartoons.</em></p><p><em>These magazines were an unlikely proving ground for neophyte gag cartoonists as well as a welcomed alternative to the daily grind of comic book sweatshops. In the 1950s and 1960s, these digests featured the likes of <strong>Playboys</strong> Jack Cole, <strong>Archies</strong> Dan DeCarlo and glamour girl legend Bill Ward. In addition to these three pin-up cartooning luminaries, other notables who contributed included longtime illustrator Jefferson Machamer, Basil Wolverton, <strong>MAD</strong>s Dave Berg (The Lighter Side), and future syndicated cartoonists George Crenshaw (<strong>Belvedere</strong>), Bill Hoest (<strong>The Lockhorns</strong>) and Brad Anderson (<strong>Marmaduke</strong>). Drawing from private collections of original art and thousands of Humorama digests, editor Alex Chun has once again selected the best of these long out-of-print images and designer Jacob Covey has lovingly \"remastered\" them in a period-accurate two-color format that duplicates the original experience of these innocently raunchy classics. You'll also find a Foreword and bonus pinup by noted purveyor of comics raunch Howard Chaykin.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>In The Beats: A Graphic History, those who were mad to live come back to life through artwork as pulsatingly vibrant as the movement itself. Told by Harvey Pekar and his frequent artistic collaborator Ed Piskor, and by a range of artists and writers, including feminist comic creator Trina Robbins and MAD Magazine artist Peter Kuper, The Beats takes us on a wild tour. From the Benzedrine-fueled antics of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs to the painting sessions of Jay DeFeo's disheveled studio, from the jazz hipsters to beatnik chicks, from Chicago's beatnik bistro to San Francisco's famed City Lights bookstore, we see the storied era in all its incarnations.</em></p>",

The setting is the pre-modern Japanese countryside of the author's youth, a slightly magical world where ancestral traditions hold sway over a people in the full vigor of life, struggling to survive the harsh seasons and the difficult life of manual laborers and farmers. While the world they inhabit has faded into memory and myth, the universal fundamental emotions of the human heart prevail at the center of these tender stories.</em></p><p><em>Susumu Katsumata began publishing comic strips in the legendary avant-garde magazine Garo (which also published his contemporaries Yoshihiro Tatsumi and Yoshiharu Tsuge) in 1965 while enrolled in the faculty of Science in Tokyo. He abandoned his studies in 1971 to become a professional comics artist, alternating the short humorous strips, upon which he built his reputation, with stories of a more personal nature in which he tenderly depicted the lives of peasants and farmers from his native region. In 2006, Susumu Katsumata won the 35th Japanese Cartoonists Association Award Grand prize for Red Snow.</em></p>",

All 144 full-color pages - including paintings, maps, sketches, comics, and more - are dedicated to Forest Island: the wild, hyperchromatic paradise Spoons has been constructing with his art for several years. The denizens of this mind-bending island include sweet whale-gators, boozy super-cicadas, arrow-slinging, basket-weaving bearded love tribes, an ex-hobo mushroom farmer, and one brutally intense bat who plays drums in a proto-metal band and would do just about anything to make a bagel relinquish its jelly filling!</em></p>",

Moriarty's painted comics offer slice-of-life vignettes that express a somehow fanciful yet deadpan take on the humor inherent in everyday moments. Since Jack Survives first appeared in Art Spiegelman's groundbreaking anthology RAW in the 80's, it has been lauded for Moriarty's innovative use of the comics medium.

Cette disparition inquiète au plus haut point le Vatican qui comprend que ce vol spectaculaire a un lien avec un secret qui remonte au XIIIème siècle... Cet objet, récupéré par les Templiers, peut tout simplement remettre en question les fondements de la chrétienté ! Un agent du FBI, associé à une jeune archéologue, part à la recherche de l'objet : une enquête de tous les dangers... Le Dernier Templier a d'abord été un roman de M. Khoury devenu un best-seller international et qui sera adapté en une série télé (sur M6 en 2009). Mais il s'agit surtout d'un récit d'aventure haletant à travers les âges !</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>This gorgeous grimoire is part alchemy, part art book, part storybook, part comic book, and part conceptual art from the pen of Al Columbia, a longtime fan favorite contributor to comics anthologies like Zero Zero, Blab!, and more recently, Mome. Collecting over a decades worth of artifacts, excavations, comic strips, animation stills, storybook covers, and much more, this broken jigsaw puzzle of a book tells the story of Pim &amp; Francie, a pair of childlike, male and female imps whose irresponsible antics get them into horrific, fantastic trouble. Their loosely defined relationship only contributes to the existential fear that lingers underneath the various perils they are subjected to. Columbias brilliant, fairytale-like backdrops hint at further layers of reality lurking under every gingerbread house or behind every sunny afternoon. Never have such colorful, imaginative vistas instilled such an atmosphere of dread, and with such a wicked sense of humor.</em></p><p><em>This is a comprehensive collection of Columbias Pim &amp; Francie work, including paintings, comics, character designs, and much more, all woven into something greater than the sum of its parts, with Pim &amp; Francie careening from danger to danger, threaded together through text and notes by the artist.</em></p><p><em>This is the first book collection by Columbia, a well-regarded talent amongst longtime fans of the alternative comic book scene, and one who will thrill an entirely new audience with the singular, inspired, fully-realized fantasies within Pim &amp; Francie.</em></p><h4>The Stories</h4><ul><li>Cinnamon Jack: The Tree of Life</li><li>The Lad of Broken Hearts: The Golden Faun</li><li>The Adventures of Pim and Francie</li><li>Funny Incest Stories #6</li><li>The Golden Bear Days</li><li>The Kitty Murders</li><li>The Exploding Eyes</li><li>Cinnamon Jack: Eyepoppers</li><li>Tales of the Haunted Forest</li><li>The Forest that Grandpa Built</li><li>Prickear the Imp</li><li>The Changeling</li><li>The Ghost of Belljar Jefferson</li><li>Tales of the Bloody Bloody Killers the Six-Six-Sixers</li><li>Pim and Francie Comics #1 (Cover)</li><li>Trixie the Wonder Dog</li><li>Pim and Francie #6 (Cover)</li><li>Grandpa's Laboratory</li><li>Black Magic Zombies</li><li>Goodbye Grandma</li><li>Greenfly Pie</li><li>Jellybeans</li><li>Tales of Ruthy and Lucy</li><li>The Body of Emily White</li><li>Dudley Town</li><li>Sparkleberries</li><li>Cinnamon Jack: Sweet Child Pie</li><li>Candyface the Clown: Camp Candyface</li><li>Candyface the Clown: Marshmallow Surprise</li><li>The Origin of Mayor Murder</li><li>Pim and Francie Visit the Vatican</li><li>Coventry</li><li>Francie's Revenge</li><li>The Heart of Love</li><li>In the House of Mayor Murder</li><li>O Death</li><li>Podsnappers</li><li>Pandemonium</li><li>Blackholebenny</li><li>Salmon Falls</li><li>Run, Run, Rabbit, Run</li><li>Pim and Francie Comics #2 (Cover)</li><li>Psycho the Cyclops</li><li>Requiem</li><li>Revelation</li><li>The Familiar</li><li>The Ferryman</li><li>Nightmare</li><li>The Forest that Grandpa Built Part II</li><li>Fun with the Groovy Gus</li><li>Pim and Francie in Toyland</li><li>Elysium </li><li>The Forest That Grandpa Built Part III</li><li>The Preacher's Mother</li><li>Grandpa's Laboratory Part II</li><li>The Ouija Board</li><li>Pim and Francie Comics (Covers)</li><li>The Golden Faun Part II</li><li>The Wünderkind</li><li>Zequiel the Imp</li><li>The Birthday Party</li><li>Requiem Part II</li><li>The Possession of Emily White</li><li>Tales of the Bloody Bloody Killer: The Devonshire Strangler</li><li>Cinnamon Jack's Bloody Daisies</li><li>Fun with Chopped Up Charlie</li><li>Into the Black</li><li>Revelation II</li><li>Goodbye Francie</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><em>You know MAD. Do you know Humbug? Harvey Kurtzman changed the face of American humor when he created the legendary MAD comic. As editor and chief writer from its inception in 1952, through its transformation into a slick magazine, and until he left MAD in 1956, he influenced an entire generation of cartoonists, comedians, and filmmakers. In 1962, he co-created the long-running Little Annie Fanny with his long-time artistic partner Will Elder forPlayboy, which he continued to produce until his virtual retirement in 1988. Between MAD and Annie Fanny, Kurtzman’s biographical summaries will note that he created and edited three other magazines―Trump, Humbug, and Help!―but, whereas his MAD and Annie Fanny are readily available in reprint form, his major satirical work in the interim period is virtually unknown. Humbug, which had poor distribution, may be the least known, but to those who treasure the rare original copies, it equals or even exceeds MAD in displaying Kurtzman’s creative genius. Humbug was unique in that it was actually published by the artists who created it: Kurtzman and his cohorts from MAD, Will Elder, Jack Davis, and Al Jaffee, were joined by universally acclaimed cartoonist Arnold Roth. With no publisher above them to rein them in, this little band of creators produced some of the most trenchant and engaging satire of American culture ever to appear on American newsstands.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The essential collection of Dan Brereton's groundbreaking Nocturnals graphic novels and stories continues in this second hardcover volume, presenting over 250 pages of material we couldn't fit into Volume 1! Doc Horror's inhuman crew of avengers, including his spirited daughter, Evening, and her pumpkin full of haunted toys, tackle creatures hiding in the roughest hidden towns, the depths of the Earth, even the bottom of the sea. The nighttime world is teeming with dangers the sleeping populace is dimly aware of and only the Nocturnals are equipped to fight. This handsome, must-have volume — for newcomers and completists alike — includes two mini-series: The Dark Forever, with story and art by Dan Brereton, and Gunwitch: Outskirts of Doom, with story by Brereton with art by Ted Naifeh (Courtney Crumrin, Death Jr.), as well as the Halloween special Troll Bridge, and the stories Spectres and Beasts. Extras include an afterword by creator Dan Brereton with Nocturnals insights and inspirations.</em></p>",

Super-hero sidekicks unite when Captain America's pal, Bucky and his Sentinels of Liberty team up with the Human Torch's protégé, Toro, and take on the Axis! And they won't waste a second getting down to business. Right from issue #1 they take the fight straight to Berlin and, rest assured, the Red Skull, and even Hitler himself, won't be walking out of this one without a bloody nose. Next up, the Black Talon returns from the pages of CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS to terrorize the Young Allies, or maybe that should be the other way around? There are 5th Columnists, Nazis, Imperial generals, spies, and action galore in each of these Timely classics.</em></p><p><em>Collects Young Allies (1941) #1-4.</em></p>",

First performed under the title All Is True in 1613, Henry VIII traces the ups and downs of fortune that rule over human affairs – in the corridors of power and behind closed doors. But who is pulling the strings in this epoch-making period of English history? And how do we know that any history is 'true'? Published in association with Historic Royal Palaces to mark the 500th anniversary of the real King Henry's accession, Henry VIII is part of Manga Shakespeare, a series of graphic novel adaptations of William Shakespeare's plays. Drawing inspiration from Japan and using Shakespeare's original texts, this series – adapted by Richard Appignanesi and illustrated by leading manga artists – brings to life the great Bard's words for students, Shakespeare enthusiasts and manga fans.</em></p>",

Antonio (his fat-cat friend in the City) is on hand to oblige – but there's a problem with cash-flow, so an interest-free loan is secured from the sinister banker Shylock, whose sole terms require the forfeit of a pound of Antonio's flesh in the ludicrous event of its non-repayment. And now the credit crunch begins to bite, and it is left to Portia to test 'the quality of mercy'...

Nor can Beatrice, when she hears her friends say that Benedick is hopelessly pining for her. Nor can Claudio, when he overhears his fiancée Hero in another man's bedroom. And now Hero is reported dead. It all adds up to another case for Constable Dogberry, perhaps the stupidest policeman on record. This manga recreation of Shakespeare's tricksiest comedy plays out its serial deceptions and counterfeits against the operatic backdrop of a later Italian landscape. But don't believe everything you hear... Much Ado About Nothing is part of Manga Shakespeare, a series of graphic novel adaptations of William Shakespeare's plays. Drawing inspiration from Japan and using Shakespeare's original texts, this series – adapted by Richard Appignanesi and illustrated by leading manga artists – brings to life the great Bard's words for students, Shakespeare enthusiasts and manga fans.</em></p>",

Her lovelorn suitor pines for her in vain; her puritanical butler spreads chilly disapproval on her drunken uncle; and even her jester is sad. But when a set of twins are shipwrecked on separate parts of the coast, the comedy of confused identity and true love that follows melts the ice and warms things up.

            "description": "<p><em>\"I realised I was leading a double life...\" Robert Louis Stevenson liked to tell the story of how The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886) came to him one night in a dream, while staying, for the sake of his health, in the provincial English seaside town of Bournemouth. He wrote the first draft in three days – then burned it when his wife suggested some changes. The second version was finished by the end of the week, and has scarcely been out of print since. The 'double life' that the book's hero (the respectable doctor Henry Jekyll) finds himself leading was something that Stevenson himself knew all about: the confined invalid who pioneered the art of travel writing; the clergyman's grandson who decadently slummed it in Edinburgh's fleshpots; the Scottish writer spuriously known by a French middle name... Well, we all have something to hide – though few of our secrets are as dreadful as Dr. Jekyll's. This dynamic graphic novel adaptation by Andrzej Klimowski and Danusia Schejbal stays eerily faithful to the creeping chill of the London streets where Stevenson's story was originally set.</em></p>",
