Over a million species of undersea life forms exist under the surface, some dating back over four hundred million years old. Aspen Matthews, marine-biologist, has researched many of them in her past. Yet, nothing in her education could have prepared her for the recent discovery of the mysterious Church of the Eternal Depths. Along with the help of her new ally Galit, Aspen must prevent this ancient order from exerting their nefarious influence over the rest of the world. Something that will become infinitely more complicated as she discovers the Church has aligned itself with the Japanese government, which has learned to apply all of the technology it has recovered over the years-much of it from none other than the race of the Blue! For the legions of FATHOM fans who have been waiting to see Aspen in her element and taking control of her life, now is the time to jump on in-the water's just fine!</i></p>",

They begin by finding a group of snake themed thugs breaking into a chemical supplies warehouse. Hawkeye quickly knocks them out using electric arrows and Spider-Man has to wait for the thugs to wake up before interrogating them as to what they were doing.</p><p>When they intercept a vehicle driven by more snake themed thugs, Hawkeye shoots arrows into the vehicle’s tyres, causing it to crash. Spider-Man has to wait for the thug to wake up again to interrogate him as well.</p><p>Using information from the thugs, Spider-Man and Hawkeye discover and imminent gas attack planned by the Serpent Society. They travel to Grand Central Station where Spider-Man watches the surrounding area to try and find the Serpent Society. While the two Avengers talk, they are ambushed by multiple Serpent Society thugs.</p><p>While Hawkeye fights the thugs, Spider-Man swings towards Sidewinder. In an attempt to defeat Sidewinder himself, Hawkeye shoots an arrow seven hundred yards but just falls short. Realizing that this could severely harm Hawkeye’s morale, Spider-Man picks up the arrow and hits Sidewinder with it. When Hawkeye arrives at the scene he begins to boast and mock Spider-Man, irritating him as well.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Book Four of Abuli and Bernet’s masterpiece, Torpedo, continues Luca Torelli’s adventures in the stinking, crime-infested waters known as New York City. There Luca and his crony pal, Rascal, maneuver their way through a black comedy of murders, mayhem and an assorted series of misadventures, all the while breathing in the most authentic version of 1930s New York ever portrayed on the comics page!</i></p><h2>Back Blurb</h2><p><i>This is the story Luca Torelli, a poor immigrant from Italy who came to New York to find a better life. Instead of a land of milk and honey he found a filthy city that was long on corruption and short on morality, a place filled with predators and human vermin. To survive in such a place, young Luca adapted to his surroundings, lived off his wits, prospered with coldhearted cunning... until he eventually became Torpedo.</i></p><p><i>Enrique Sánchez Abuli and Jordi Bernet's masterpiece is a darkly humorous exploration of the criminal underbelly in 1930s New York City. Abduli's distinctive narrative builds the story over time and Bernet's masterful renditions of the title character and the city he inhabits are stunningly cinematic.</i></p><h2>Story Titles</h2><ul><li>The Cat's Nine Lives</li><li>The Dove of Peace</li><li>All That Glitters Is Not Gold</li><li>I'll Spit On Your Grave</li><li>The Inning</li><li>Sodom and Gamorrah</li><li>The Harder They Fall</li><li>A Stop Along The Way</li><li>Coyote</li><li>The Deafened</li><li>The Godmother</li><li>The Binger</li><li>Guess Who Bites It Tonight</li><li>Who Is Afraid Of The Big, Bad Wolf?</li><li>One, And Two, And Three</li><li>The Front</li></ul>",

The space-born super hero rose to greatness in under the stewardship of Jim Starlin – and now Steve Englehart and Al Milgrom are here to take the good Captain to the next level.</i></p><p><i>Beginning with pivotal first appearance of Nitro and the fight for Compound 13, the action jumps into the Negative Zone where Annihilus confronts Marv’s other half, Rick Jones. Then it’s off to the Blue Area of the Moon where the Lunatic Legion and the Watcher want the Kree Captain dead. It’s a fight that will forever change our Nega-Band-bound combo.</i></p><p><i>Next comes a trip to the Watcher’s homeworld for trial of Uatu. A return to Hala reveals the Supreme Intelligence’s master plan for Cap and Rick, and the residents of Earth aren’t going to like it one bit. Topped off with menaces including Ronan the Accuser, Drax the Destroyer and the Stranger; team-ups with Ant-Man and the Wasp; and appearances of cosmic Marvel lynchpins the Universal Church of Truth and the Soul Gem, these are the intergalactic adventures that made Captain Marvel a legend!</i></p><p><i>Collecting CAPTAIN MARVEL #34-46</i></p>",

His big chance to be a superhero alongside his idol, Zenith, has turned into a nightmare that saw several people die right in front of him. Hoping to get perspective from his mentor, Adam soon finds that the fantasy veil of Zenith's public persona has been wiped away and he is getting a painful peek behind the curtain. When questions about motivation and responsibility turn to violence, Adam soon finds that the Zenith Corporation has a very tight hold on the media and what is presented as \"the truth.\" With the government stepping in to the picture it is only a matter of time before everything crumbles into chaos. This year's blockbuster superhero story belongs to Zak Penn, Scott Murphy, and Michael Dipascale! Available with a Regular, Wraparound, and a special Heroic Incentive cover by Michael Dipascale.</i></p>",

And in 'Highland Laddie' (the complete 6-issue mini-series), Hughie heads home to Scotland. But our hero's luck has always been more cloud than silver lining, and the familiar surroundings he craves are not all they might be.

            "description": "<p><em>Hairbutt the Hippo stars an anthropomorphic hippopotamus named Hairbutt, who works as a private detective. This issue tells a two-fisted tale of crime noir fiction entitled \"The Stress Test\". Brought to you by the decidedly-twisted good folks at Rat Race Comix Bodine Amerikah and Jason Paulos. Here comes the thundering saga of a Down Under private dick who does not go gently into that good night. You know him, you love him! Yes, it's HAIRBUTT THE HIPPO, he of the nasty temperament and even nastier personal grooming habits. Like one of the covers boasts, \"Uncut! Uncensored! Unashamed! Unhygenic!\"</em></p>",
