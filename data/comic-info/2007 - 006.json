If you like quirky B-list villains (C-list maybe?) this issue is for you. Luke Cage and Iron Fist move over, \"Heroes For Hire\" is under new management.</p><p>In this issue Humbug fights the Headmen (Arthur Nagan, Chondu The Mystic, Ruby Thursday and Jerry Morgan).

Three men arrive to become farmhands for the upcoming harvest.</p><p>Later Clark is having lunch with Lana Lang and Pete Ross. He voices his suspicions on the new additions to the farm. He also ponders whether he should stay in Smallville or move on to Metropolis to pursue his journalist career.</p><p>Clark soon realizes that the three farmhands have superpowers and an \"action suit\" just like his. The three introduce themselves as part of the Superman Squad, a team of Supermen from different eras that help protect the structure of spacetime. Kal Kent reveals himself as a future descendant of Clark's from the year A.D. 853,500. Klyzyzk Klzntplkz is the Superman from the 5th Dimension and the third, bandaged Superman is the Unknown Superman from A.D. 4500.</p><p>Just then the Chronovore, a being that ages everything it touches, arrives. The three members of the Superman Squad tell Clark to stand back as they handle the threat. Being young and arrogant, Clark insists on defending his own world.</p><p>With the help of Krypto, Clark manages to break free of Kal's grasp and heads off to fight the Chronovore. During this time, the Unknown Superman is back at the farm talking with Pa. As Clark continues to fight the Chronovore with Klyzyzk, Kal says that the Chornovore will eat a precious three minutes of Clark's life. The three minutes in which Pa suffers a fatal heart attack.</p><p>At Pa's funeral, Clark speaks on how his father taught him right from wrong and how to dream of a better world.</p><p>Clark is in tears as he prepares to leave Ma and the farm. At the other end of the farm, three more members of the Superman Squad arrive (including the Golden Superman from DC 1.000.000 and Superman 2 aka Secundus) as the Unknown Superman reveals himself to be a future incarnation of Superman, happy to have had one more chance to visit with Pa.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The Black Tarantula lays a trap, Mad Dog takes aim and Spider-Girl battles the Hobgoblin for the life of a counterfeit web-stunner! Plus: Mayday Parker also confronts her parents and finally answers the question, \"Whatever happened to the daughter of Spider-Man?\"</em></p><p>Peter Parker busts into May's room holding the latest copy of the Daily Bugle. He is outraged that she is appearing as Spider-Girl at a comic store since she was supposed to hang up her webs. Relieved that she hadn't actually been called out, she tells him that it's just a publicity stunt that her friends, Jimmy Yama and Wes Westin, set up to promote their comic book. Peter apologizes as she heads out for school. Mary Jane had overheard the entire conversation and tells May she's going to have come clean with him soon, including dropping out of the student council race. She thinks about all this plus wonders what she should do with the Kingpin's disk that the Hobgoblin is after.</p><p>At the Midtown Police Station, Detective Drasco continues to question Mona Carlo about the disk. She tells him that she gave it to Spider-Girl and is actually glad to be rid of it. Drasco calls the Hobgoblin and tells him what he discovered. He says he believes Carlo. The Hobgoblin isn't ready to completely believe her yet but plans on confronting Spider-Girl for himself.</p><p>At Midtown High, May finds that someone has written \"Quitter\" on her locker. She thought the defacing would be over now that she was out of the election. She is soon joined by Felicity who is assuming that May's dropout means she's going to spend more time as Spider-Girl. She offers her help if she needs it. May takes her up and tells her that she needs help accessing the disk. Felicity is unable to open it.</p><p>In South America, Black Tarantula recieves a call from Chesbro telling him that his source in the police department says Spider-Girl may have the disk that he and Hobgoblin wants. Black Tarantula doesn't wish to confront her just now so he plans to leave it be. But he does want to send Hobgoblin a message.</p><p>At the Deacon's Den comic shop, Heather prepares to put on the Spider-Girl costume Jimmy and Wes have provided. There is a big crowd waiting as Hobgoblin crashes through and grabs Heather. Not having a choice, May has to run out and change to save her. Hobgoblin has figured out that Heather wasn't really Spider-Girl. She was going to be bait for her. Still not possessing web fluid, May has to fight without spinning webs. SHe tells Hobgoblin that she destroyed the disk when she couldn't open it. Soon she is able to get Hobgoblin to release Heather by using a stinger. As they land, she slightly injures her ankle. Spider-Girl prepares to go on the offensive in order to surprise Hobgoblin when a string of bullets is fired and damages his glider. Hobgoblin can assume that this is from Black Tarantula. Not prepared to face him just now, he leaves. He also assumes that Spider-Girl gave the disk to Black Tarantula in exchange for protection.</p><p>Spider-Girl later meets with Detective Drasco. She hands the disk over to him, not knowing that he works for the Hobgoblin. She figures he's one of \"New York's Finest\" and will do the right thing with it. As she arrives at home, she tells her father everything. She says that she did not choose to be a hero. It chose her. Mary Jane also admits that she gave May back her costume. With everything out, May says she needs to get some air. Not entirely angry, Peter tells her that the conversation is not over. Outside, May is relieved that it is out. She feels this is a new beginning for her.</p>",

A brutal tale of honor, love and, above all, vengeance.</em></p><p>Flowers For The Sun does not pick up at the end of issue #5 of the series. It takes place in what may be an alternate reality or the past. No real explanation is given for the setting.</p><p>In feudal Japan, a man that seems to be a version of Midnighter sits on a hill in a dead forest. There are bones of many dead men around the base of the hill and a group of armed nobles and samurai around the bones. \"Midnighter\" tells them that he's invited them to listen to a story. As soon as they're ready to hear it, he tells them.</p><p>One morning, Midnighter awoke with no memory of who he was. He was wearing black armor and had two swords. People assumed he was a ronin, but Midnighter could never remember having a master or even being trained to fight. He found himself walking near a castle when he was attacked by more than 60 guards. He killed them all and, amazingly, came out untouched. The shogun, impressed by his skill, hired him to work for him.</p><p>While Midnighter worked on protecting the shogun's territories and the shogun tried to help Midnighter by uncovering his past, the shogun's senior minister plotted a way to get rid of Midnighter.</p><p>One day, the shogun and Midnighter were walking through the market when a man in white (Apollo) came into town. He was harassed by some drunk men who wanted to fight. Crying, Apollo tried to get them to leave him alone. They wouldn't, so Apollo raised his sword and killed them all in one single strike. The shogun sends Midnighter to talk to the man in white and he does. Apollo comes to work for the shogun and he and Midnighter soon fall in love. However, it's not meant to last.</p><p>Midnighter alone was a problem for the shogun's senior minister, but now with Apollo there, he wasn't getting enough attention. While Apollo and Midnighter are sleeping, he sends over 200 ninjas to kill them. The fight is long and hard but Midnighter survives. Unfortunately, Apollo does not. Midnighter tortures the only surviving ninja until he finds out who was responsible. He leaves the shogun's palace for a year to mourn and bury his love, but when he comes back, he drowns the minister in his own bath.</p><p>Back on the hill, which is also Apollo's grave, Midnighter tells the men gathered that every year he brings his lover flowers. Then he tells them to defend themselves. The fight is quick and at the end, a dozen hearts are resting on Apollo's grave.</p>",

And a Perfect Place for New Readers to Jump On!</i></p><p><i>That’s right, if you’ve been missing out on Criminal up until now, this is your chance to see why the critics have hailed it as Brubaker and Phillips best work! Pick up the first trade collection, for the story of Leo, and then join us in issue #6 for a new beginning as we meet Tracy Lawless, the last surviving son of a once-famous family of crooks (who have been lurking in the background of Criminal since the first issue).</i></p><p><i>Twenty years ago, Tracy Lawless traded the crime-ridden streets of the city for a life in the military, and it’s a decision he’s rarely regretted. But now he’s walking out of the deserts of Afghanistan and Iraq and back into the world he grew up in, to find out who killed his brother Rick, and why. But truth is one of the few things uglier than family history, and the only thing Tracy has in his favor as he unravels the twisted strands of the criminal life his brother led, is that no one knows who the hell he is. And what they don’t know, just might kill them. Don’t miss the hard-hitting debut of the next Criminal lead character, in “Lawless” Part 1! And remember, every issue of Criminal is crammed cover to cover with content, including text pieces, back-up stories and noir articles by Brubaker and many other crime writers!</i></p>",

Matt picks up a blood-covered letter next to the book and asks her what it says since the blood prevents him from reading it. Laura says it was a letter her mother gave to her, but she can’t read it either because the blood washed the words away. Captain America gets back to his questioning and asks what happened at the Xavier Institute. X-23 tells him.</p><p>At first she couldn’t find Wolverine because there were too many scents from other mutants. When she finally did find him, ten days later, he was with someone else. By day twenty-four she had been able to get close to him, avoiding the schools telepaths by waiting until they were focused on other people. She didn’t actually reach him though, because the wind shifted and gave her away. That night, he left the school and she followed him. She tracked him (or he led her) all the way to the US/Canadian border where he set up a campfire and waited. She got in close, but he already knew she was there. He told her to stop messing around and she attacked. He tried to talk her down, but she kept coming at him. At first, he didn’t fight back, just avoided all her attempts to slash and stab him. She managed to cut him with the claw in her foot and he tried to tell her that he’d just heal like she would, but she used her other claws to cut his throat. After that, he got mad and unsheathed his own claws, telling her that he’d <strong>make</strong> her listen. They traded slashes but every time X-23 stabbed Wolverine, she took some dirt and smeared it in his wound. After a few stabs, Wolverine realized what she was doing.</p><p>She was using the dirt to stop the wounds from fully healing so he would bleed out. By the time he figured it out though, he was feeling the effects of the blood loss and he was slow and disoriented. She got him down and had claws to his throat and her own head. She told him that they were <em>both</em> weapons and that they had to be destroyed. In response, Logan said that if she wanted to kill him, that was fine, but he wouldn’t let her kill herself. He moved her other hand from her head to his own but she kept saying that they both had to die. He said that he might, but that she had had no choice in her actions and they weren’t her fault. He also said that Laura’s mother had sent him a letter telling him everything that had happened, and that it wasn’t her fault. Laura stood up and bought away her claws and started to cry and told Logan that they made her kill her mother, and he got up off the ground and said he was sorry.</p><p>A little later, Laura had stopped trying to kill Logan and they were sitting by the campfire and talking. Logan told her that her mother had sent the letter in case she didn’t make it out, and by the time he’d gotten it, Laura was already gone from the facility. He told her that she had a choice, the letter her mother had sent was in Logan’s jacket. She could find out what her mother had said if she wanted. Logan then told her that she could stay at the Xavier Institute and that Professor X could help her like he’d helped Logan. As they were talking, they both heard the sound of helicopters and immediately sprang to their feet. X-23 thought it was the facility, but Wolverine knew better. It was SHIELD. Wolverine jumped into the line of fire and took some bullets for X-23 while telling her to run. She ran, but not fast or far enough. Captain America took her down with his shield and placed her under arrest. In New York City, Daredevil swung into his house just as the phone rang. Captain America was calling Matt Murdock and asking him for a favor.</p><p>Back in the present, where X-23 is being questioned, Matt Murdock tells Captain America that he should have left the girl with Wolverine and that by arresting her, he had taken away her best chance for some sort of normal life. Captain America justifies his actions by pointing out that Laura has killed hundreds of people. Matt lifts up the letter that Logan had given X-23 from her mother and tells Captain America that in the letter Sarah takes the blame for everything, all the murders, even the executions of other guilty parties at the facility. Steve says that means nothing, but Matt says that it does because everyone Steve is after is dead and Laura is just as much of victim as the people she killed. Steve says that X-23 has to be held accountable and Matt responds by saying that SHIELD won’t hold her accountable. They won’t put her on trial or in jail, they’ll just use her like a weapon. Steve says that the conversation is over but Matt tries to stop him from taking X-23 in. Steve says that he only needed Matt to see if the girl was lying and now that she’s confessed, he can make her face justice.</p><p>Twelve hours later, Captain America is driving X-23 to a SHIELD substation and telling her that he <em>has</em> to take her in. Along the way though, he realizes that Daredevil was right and has a change of heart. At a greyhound bus station, Laura asks him why he’s letting her go and he tells her that he doesn’t want people to keep using her as a weapon and he wants her to try to build a normal life if that’s possible. He tells her to get on the bus and go to Logan so he can help. On the bus, Laura overhears a mother looking at animal flash cards with her son. The mother holds up a picture of an eagle’s claw and asks the boy what it’s called. The boy says, “talon.” X-23 opens her bag and pulls out her mother’s letter so she can read it.</p>",

What horrible evil will rise that will plague the world for a thousand years, and how will the combined might of the Justice League and the Justice Society stop it?</p><p>The Legion have left. Superman recalls a time when he and the Legion (in his youth) were willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. They were more than just a team.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Legion are flying off to their destination. They feel bad that they couldn't tell Superman what they have to do. They were to arrive in this time, complete their mission, and then return to their time. As they talk to each other, they comment on Starman's unstableness. Because of his schizoprenia, Brainiac 5 didn't give him clearance to travel back in time. Starman tricked Colossal Boy and took his place. The time beam wasn't set for him so that could have added to his problems. He seems to have been affected by the Mutlitverse too. When he first arrived at this time, he ended up in a parallel Earth (which Starman mutters Earth-22).</p><p>The Legion see that they are not the first to arrive at their destination. Wonder Woman, Liberty Belle, Black Lightning, Hourman, and Damage are walking through the jungle. They have detected a signal from a Legion flight ring. It is coming from inside of the Secret Society's old headquarters. As they blast it open, they find Triplicate Gril inside. There is a giant computer that needs to be destroyed. It is in this computer that the world's first \"psychopathic artificial intelligence\" is born. It can calculate the destruction of super-heroes. Hiding in the shadows, appears to be another Legion member.</p><p>The computer becomes activated and begins attacking. The rest of the Legion reveal themselves, along with the rest of the JLA and JSA. Dawnstar finds the Legion that is hiding and says they did a good job and can stop. Uttering an alien phrase, the last Legion member is restored. One of the Triplicate Girl's bodies seems to be incinerated.</p><p>Suddenly Superman tells everyone to stop. He tells Power Girl to use her x-ray vision to see that everything is an illusion. Superman tells them that Triplicate Girl wasn't even there. He says it was a member named Sensor Girl.</p><p>The Legion fly away. They each have the coordinates for where they each need to go. They say their goodbyes and split up.</p>",

But, since his family had had their share of problems while Chris was growing up, there were times when Chris <i>disliked</i> being compared to him. Chris' father had been a police officer, who'd always seen the worst in people and believed that the bad always maintained an upper hand over the good. He had sacrificed a lot to try and even that balance over the years, even at the expense of Chris's family's happiness. Because of this, Chris was resentful of his father. But, as Chris got older, he realized exactly why his father did what he did. He had hoped to tip the scales so that the good side would have a brighter future, and once Chris stumbled across the Darkhawk amulet, he found himself following in his father's footsteps. But, he's had to stop... for his own safety.</p><p>The Darkhawk amulet had given him all kinds of different powers and different armors over the years, but the more he's used it the greater a mystery it has become. Chris used to believe that the amulet only affected him on a physical level, but more and more these days, it's psychological. And not in a good way. The less he uses it... the better. Chris worries about all the trouble knocking at their door. Mickey (Turbo) is always stressed and seems constantly pissed at him. Julie (Lightspeed) has been lying about who and what she is. No one ever trusted Mattie (Spider-Woman III) and Johnny (Ricochet) seems like he doesn't even care anymore. Out of all of Excelsior, Chris strongly dislikes Phil (Green Goblin), because he knows Phil still carries a torch for Mickey. He's starting to become the most unhinged... but what can you expect from a former Green Goblin?</p><p>Chris has seen his real family pulled apart once before. He doesn't like seeing his 'family' here suffering through the same thing, so it's up to him to fight to keep them together... just like his father would.</p><p>(The apartment of Mickey Musashi)</p><p>As Chris recovers from the blow he received with the flower vase, he remembers how he learned most of what he knows about life from his dad. He had helped open Chris's eyes to the way the world really works. As a cop with too many years under his belt, he had believed that the good guys were the underdogs. \"If only our side had an edge,\" is what he used to say. As Chris gets up, he is stunned to see that his Darkhawk amulet is gone from his chest and horrified to see that Phil, or the Green Goblin, is under the guise of Darkhawk. Right now, Chris could sure as hell use an edge.</p><p>Hollow, frightened, attacks Phil who promptly knocks her out, laughing the maniacal laugh of a Green Goblin. The Goblin grabs Mickey before she attempts to escape using a grappling hook. Darkly, he asks Mickey if this is what she had always secretly wanted - both loves of her life (Darkhawk and \"Phil\") put into one being. He asks her for a kiss, but this is when Chris gets up with a baseball bat in his hands. The Green Goblin laughs again. Chris, the knight without his shining armor. The Goblin taunts Chris; a baseball bat against the Darkhawk armor? That blow must have knocked him senseless. Chris, enraged, attacks the Goblin with the bat and roars about how he knows what his amulet is capable of. Chris touches the glowing amulet on the Goblin's chest, and within seconds, he becomes Darkhawk as well.</p><p>Darkhawk immediately throws the Green Goblin out through Mickey's roof. Julie, carrying Namie, flies overhead just in time to see the Green Goblin blasted into the air. Thinking the Goblin is Darkhawk, Julie attempts to help him. The Goblin, however, snaps and rams the both of them into a nearby pool. It is at this point where the real Darkhawk flies out through Mickey's roof and mutters about how he should have <i>known</i> Phil was crazy. The Goblin, in a fit of rage, screams about how he's nothing like the other Goblins. Darkhawk finally realizes that it was Phil who wasn't really listening at their meetings. He shouldn't deny his problem - he should open his eyes and accept it. And with that, both Darkhawk and the Green Goblin begin battling... in a fight that takes them through the streets of Los Angeles.</p><p>Julie and Namie, sopping wet, climb out of the pool and rush up to Mickey's apartment, finding her on the floor with Hollow standing over her. As Julie helps Mickey, Namie, stunned, freezes when she recognizes Hollow. Hollow instantly rushes over to Namie and hugs her, prompting Julie to wonder why she isn't surprised that they both know each other - both Namie and Hollow were Fujikawa escapees. Namie apologizes for Hollow's behavior, but Mickey cuts her off by saying Hollow attempted to protect her from that psycho. Mickey quickly recounts the events of what happened with Darkhawk and the Green Goblin. Julie wonders how two Darkhawks is even possible, leading Mickey to wonder how Chris's amulet works. Darkhawk had a couple of different armors over the years... and they always just assumed it was Chris inside. And it hits Julie: what if it wasn't Chris inside? That could explain his freak-outs...</p><p>Before she goes on, Johnny and Mattie both arrive. Mattie instantly understands that a couple guests 'in costume' have shown up. Mickey, sour, confirms it. She walks to her bedroom, and tells Julie, Namie, Hollow, Johnny and Mattie that she is tired of sitting on the sidelines. What good has it done her? She's been lied to, betrayed, and almost killed. Enough is enough! As she takes out a box from under her bed, she realizes that maybe the Goblin was right... maybe she <i>is</i> scared. But, there's nothing like a little fear to remind her what her responsibilities in life are. So to hell with their rules for the time being! As of now... the gloves are back on! And with that, Mickey puts on her Turbo gloves!</p><p>Darkhawk and the Green Goblin continue their battle, but are suddenly blasted away from one another. As it turns out, the rest of Excelsior has arrived: Turbo, Spider-Woman, Namie, Hollow, Lightspeed and Ricochet rush to Darkhawk's side, with Turbo proud of her costume. She blasts the Green Goblin off his feet while battling him at the same time. The Goblin attempts to escape, but Spider-Woman uses her many legs to pin him down. Ricochet blasts several of his discs at the Goblin while Hollow claws at him. Lightspeed then rams him into the ground, the same way he rammed her into the pool. Finally, one of Ricochet's discs hits the Goblin in his armored eyes. The Goblin screams his lungs out, but Namie tells him that blindness should be the least of his worries. The red laser-like dagger appears at the band on her wrist. Using it, she picks the Darkhawk amulet off the Goblin's chest. The Darkhawk armor disappears from the Green Goblin's skin, leaving him in a fit of despair.</p><p>Hollow attacks the possessed Phil, but Darkhawk tells her to stop. Instead, he attacks the Goblin... man-to-man. Turning off the Darkhawk armor, Chris holds the Goblin around the throat. Turbo tells Chris to stop. Instead, she attacks the Goblin, woman-to-man. She punches the Goblin to the ground, where he lands right beside the Darkhawk amulet. Turbo snatches it from him and hands it to Chris, telling him that he was right. Their powers, no matter where they got them from, are part of who they all are. It's time she started accepting that. Chris, taking his amulet back, thanks her.</p><p>The Goblin, still on the ground, laughs his wild laugh. He tells Turbo that he knew she had it in her; she just needed a little help bringing her demons back out. He knew she wasn't ready to give up her costume. He tells her that there is still hope for them. Turbo, disgusted, tells him that the only hope she has is that he get help with all his romantic delusions. And, once she makes sure he's taken care of, the costume is going back into the closet. The Goblin grins, telling her that Miss Fujikawa is going to be <i>disappointed</i>. Turbo, confused, asks him what he means by that. The Goblin reveals that he also cut a deal with Miss Fujikawa, and Miss Fujikawa was more than happy to tell him all about their little arrangement - about how she was planning on selling out Excelsior! Turbo roars at him to shut up, but Spider-Woman, taking off her mask, urges the Goblin to continue talking. If someone is bargaining with their lives, they'd all want to know about it. \"Personalizing our problem is the first step in confronting it,\" Mattie quotes. Turbo snarls about how it's none of Mattie's business.</p><p>Mattie tells Turbo to let her be the judge of that. The Goblin maliciously taunts Turbo, who gives him a hard, solid smack across the face. Hollow rushes in and protects the Goblin. Someone always has to get hurt when the truth comes out. Turbo, angry, asks the Goblin how Hollow can defend him even after all this. Getting up, the Goblin tells her that maybe Hollow knows who her true friends really <i>are</i>. Or, maybe her memories are finally coming back. Lightspeed prompts the Goblin to reveal what Miss Fujikawa had said to him. Laughing, the Goblin informs her that for now, it's his secret. She, of all people, can respect that. Ricochet is disgusted with Phil's betrayal; he's like the Goblin calling the frog green... if that makes any sense. The Green Goblin moves away from them, and tells them it's his time to make his exit. Darkhawk tells him that he isn't going anywhere after all he's done. The Goblin, laughing, tells him there is no evidence to prove he did anything. He assures Excelsior that Hollow will be going back into good hands, where she will be cared for. Finally, the Goblin tells Excelsior that to hold up her end of the deal, Miss Fujikawa is letting them keep the Red Ronin in exchange for Hollow. Turbo, confused, wonders what Miss Fujikawa expects them to do with a giant robot. The Green Goblin corrects her and reveals that he never meant <i>that</i> Red Ronin. It was decommissioned years ago. Miss Fujikawa had left them the new model, the UJ1-DX... Namie!</p><p>Excelsior is shocked. The Green Goblin tells them that Namie is another lost soul who has no idea of what she truly is. Because of this, she's going to fit perfectly with Mickey's group. If they can ever pull themselves back together and get back on the wagon! And with that, laughing maniacally, the Green Goblin and Hollow leave Excelsior for good. After a short silence, Mattie admits that Phil was right. She herself is sour about how she almost bought into the whole 'doing more good by not using their powers' crock they're selling. Mattie tells Excelsior to count her out from now on. They've been trying so hard to stay out of costume and put their pasts behind them... some of them seem to have forgotten what it means to be a hero in the first place. Finally, she tells Ricochet that she can't believe she actually slept with him. And with that, Mattie also leaves the group as well, leaving a confused Excelsior behind. Namie, still shocked about what she is, sits by herself on the ground. Johnny awkwardly turns away from Julie, while Mickey desperately stares at Chris, wondering's what's next.</p><p>(The apartment of Johnny Gallo - one week later)</p><p>One week later, Excelsior meets in Johnny's apartment. Namie, in different clothes, sits with her head down. Julie has her arms crossed, Mickey sits sternly, but Chris stares at two empty chairs... chairs that should have been filled with Phil Urich and Mattie Franklin. Johnny apologizes for putting the chairs there... he had hoped the other two would come. Wishful thinking, he guesses. Julie bitterly makes a dark remark about how she knows what Johnny was wishing for (Mattie). Mickey then thanks everyone for arriving, especially given what happened the week before. She does feel it's important that they <i>talk</i> about what they're feeling out in the open, now more than ever. Mickey asks if Julie would like to open up to anything; Julie turns her head and says she's still confused about a lot of things. She then asks Chris about the whole double-Darkhawk situation. He says that there are a few things he needs to figure out himself. She asks Namie if she's had any luck with her memories, but Namie bluntly tells her that all her circuits are still busy. Mickey finally asks Johnny, but he tells her he pleads the fifth. Mickey stands up, and tells the group she'll start, as she clearly has the most explaining... and apologizing... to do. Mickey stands up, and introduces herself as a former teenage superhero. Everyone says hi.</p><p>But Chris Powell thinks... when your eyes are opened to the way the world really works, people usually find that they don't like what they see. Especially what they see in themselves. There will always be questions they want answered (Namie), and mysteries they want solved (Phil and Mattie). They have to accept the fact that some secrets will remain hidden (Johnny) and certain truths will remain untold (Julie). But even when trust is shattered and the pain of guilt is almost too much to bear, they have to remember that there's always hope. And no matter how badly things have fallen apart around them, that hope will slowly put the pieces back together again.</p><p>The end... for now.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>At the time these synopses were written, not much has been seen of Excelsior. They next appeared in a story called 'Secret Santa' in Marvel Holiday Special 2007 and then in War of Kings: Darkhawk #1. Darkhawk left Excelsior, registered himself as a super hero and became the Head of Security at Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. He hooked up with Excelsior again in War of Kings: Darkhawk #1.</li><li>The cover is a homage of the movie poster for <em>Sixteen Candles<strong>.</strong></em></li></ul>",

He's caught between two violent groups, beaten and harassed by revenge-hungry policemen, and hounded by a sadistic drug lord who may have ties to Elijah's father. In Hiroki Endo's post-pandemic world, humanity is quickly rebuilding its cities and returning to the comforts and conveniences of large urban environments-but reviving destructive, age-old habits as well. While exploring the crippling vices that have plagued humanity throughout history, Endo also serves up a volume of bittersweet reunions, shifting alliances, and surprising new settings.</em></p><p><em><strong>Eden</strong> volume 6 also includes a bonus section featuring character studies and pinups by Hiroki Endo and Hiroaki Samura (<strong>Blade of the Immortal</strong>)!!</em></p>",

Beginning with a pair of irredeemable uglies, Replicus and the Super-Skrull, the adventure then takes itself up a Norse notch when the evil Loki conspires to have Thor stripped of his power and vanquished to Earth! Stranded there, he must struggle to survive the machinations of his scheming half-brother, while attemping to regain the graces of All-Father Odin.</i></p><p><i>Last, but not least: Enter one of the most beloved baddies in all of the Asgardian entourage: The Wrecker! The decidedly mortal Thor must battle to his very last breath against this crowbar-wielding wingnut, who himself is powered with Asgardian might! And just 'cause we hate to close on a quiet note, it all ends in an action-packed finale with back-to-back battles with the undefeatable Destroyer and Ulik, the invincible!</i></p><p><i>It’s drama as only the Masters of the Marvel Age can make it!</i></p><p><i>Collecting Thor (Vol. 1) #141-152</i></p>",
