But only Carter can see them, causing him to question his own sanity. Can Hawkman unravel the mystery before it consumes him?</i></p><p>Carter begins to see everyone as a zombie, even Emma. Suddenly, his armor begins to manifest and Carter closes his eyes. As he opens them again, the people is back to normal. Emma asks if he is okay, and Carter excuses himself. Manifesting his armor, Hawkman flies away, believing that perhaps the Nth metal is toxic, like mercury.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Digby's Rare Book Emporium, a ghost begins harassing Mr. Digby, the store's owner. The ghost says that he is interested in a book about symbols and hieroglyphics. He also says that he wants to know about the Mortis Orb. Then, the ghost grabs Digby by the neck, saying that he will decipher the book for him.</p><p>Hawkman arrives to his apartment building on the Bronx. Dissipating his armor, Carter meets up with a boy named Singh, who tells him that a girl named Emma came looking for him. Singh also expresses interest in Emma, but Carter ignores him. As he enters his apartment, he gets a call from Professor Ziegler, who has a job for him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Digby tells the mysterious ghost that he did as he asked. The ghost is pleased and says that for once in his life, Digby will make a difference.</p><p>Carter arrives at Professor Ziegler's temporary lab, and Professor Ziegler hands him an ancient text brought to him by a client who wanted it translated.</p><p>Using his translation power, Carter deciphers the book, reliving the battle between a sect of warlock and an army of resurrected corpses capable of phasing between two planes of existence. Using the Mortis Orb, the warlocks were victorious but at a heavy cost. The warlocks gave the orb to a mysterious stranger who sought to hide it forever at the ends of the Earth.</p><p>After finishing the translation, Carter asks to take the book with him, and Professor Ziegler agrees. Then, Carter asks who gave him the book, and Professor Ziegler replies that it was a man named Jim Craddock.</p><p>Later, Carter and Singh investigate Craddock, discovering that Craddock was a notorious British highwayman who lived in the 1800s and was executed. Carter asks about the image from the surveillance camera, and Singh discovers that the man who dropped off the book is named Darius Digby, the owner of a bookshop at Greenwich Village.</p><p>Suddenly, Carter sees zombies trying to break through the window. Tackling Singh to the floor, Carter tries to protect him, but the zombies disappear, revealing it was just an illusion.

The horror does not end there, however, as the repercussions of the dark matter accident have manifested in far-off Greece, where an ancient evil has once again been unleashed upon the world. Aided by the monstrous Harpies, Satheeno has escaped her centuries-long imprisonment, but can Theronia, the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt possibly prevail against the gathering forces of darkness?

In his youth he aspired to be a painter but was rejected from art school. He worked as a day laborer before enlisting in the army and serving in World War I. After the war he became involved in the National Socialist German Worker’s Party (the Nazi Party), expanding its influence and becoming its leader. Hitler’s charismatic oratory garnered many followers and led to his appointment as chancellor. In that position, he disbanded all rival political parties and established a single-party dictatorship. He declared himself the “Fuhrer,” or supreme ruler, and called his reign the “Third Reich.” Germany’s invasion of Poland instigated World War II, while domestically Hitler maintained strict control of the ideology of the citizenry, initiating the genocide of the Jewish people known as the “Holocaust.” Hitler committed suicide in his underground bunker in 1945 after Berlin fell to the Allies.</i></p><p>Chapters Twenty-Five to Thirty.</p>",

Packed full of raw testosterone, fury, and animal lust, Ferals delivers intense character drama with violence that will leave you speechless. David Lapham has combined his trademark flare for creating interesting characters and his hard-edged crime fiction with a cast of violent supernatural killers.</i></p>",

They've spilled blood, drank even more, and left a wake of destruction behind them to span the ages. Now, caught between a past unremembered and a present that seems to shift by the day, these time-tossed titans of the Vampire breed find themselves unable to resist their animal attraction any longer. And as timelines fold and realities crumble before the climax of their union, an old story comes to a painful close... while a new, bloody saga is born!</i></p>",

In the idyllic surroundings of a great house, mingling with the aristocracy, Suttle discovers that the undead curse of the Restless Plague runs ever deeper...</i></p><p>Suttle drives with Bowes to Buckinghamshire to visit the family of Lord Hinchcliffe, one of the murder victims. His son, the new Lord Hinchcliffe, is not particularly interested in the investigation and rather goes out shooting zombies in the country. He goes on to talk to Hinchcliffe's wife who is upset about the death, but also about the cure itself. The shooting party outside unsettles Suttle and reminds him of the war.</p><p>He decides to stay overnight and when he tells Bowes, he meets Lady Celia, Hinchcliffe's daughter. She doesn't mourn her father at all and fought with him over her fight for emancipation of women. She wants to have the right to take the cure, too. Suttle tries to tell her that the cure is not as great as she may think, but she is only concerned that her father's death takes away an important cause for her emancipation movement.</p><p>Suttle finds out that Hinchcliffe and his ancestors were part of a secret society called \"Sons of Adam\". At dinner, a discussion over a new war in the East starts and the guest Lord Falconbridge wonders how wars will be fought without death as the final resolve. Celia starts with her cause but Suttle tells her and everyone again, that he doesn't think the cure is a benefit, but takes away any appetite or hunger, which to him is the point of life.</p><p>Lord Falconbridge talks to Suttle in private and tells him, that the government is very interested in getting the case settled without giving the public the idea, that the cure isn't really working. He even indirectly suggests covering it up with false witnesses and evidence but Suttle gets angry at this proposition. He then tells Suttle that Hinchcliffe's son had a motive for killing his father because with the cure, inheritance doesn't work anymore, making young Hinchcliffe forever an heir without any chance to become a lord. Suttle doesn't trust Falconbridge and is instead interested in the \"Sons of Adam\".</p>",

Normally he spends most of his time teaching teens life lessons. He uses the school of hard knocks technique to open people's hearts. However in this situation the GTO must make an effort to reunite a child with his mother. He must also teach the child that sometimes choosing family is not the right solution.</i></p><p><i>Everyone would like to have a happy household. Being able to sit by the dinner table to discuss the day's highlights is an ideal that is not reality for millions across the globe. And in the case of the teens at the White Swan such realities are generally fictitious because of a variety of reasons. That does not excuse anyone involved from wishing for such a life, but changing the hearts of adults often means changing their lives at their core. Words or fisticuffs will not be enough.</i></p><p><i>So Seiya, a young man, who appears to be on the way to a pleasant self-reliant life, turns to violence to try to get his mother and family life back. But what happens when your very own mother is willing to take a knife at you? Well this is Seiya's reality. And this is one lesson Onizuka will hate to have taught.</i></p><p><i>Then the spotlight turns to Onizuka's employer, Great Vice-Principal Uchiyamada. He's also in Shonan and on the hunt for Onizuka. But out of his element and turf, this educator is now caught up in a wild ride through the Tokyo suburbs.</i></p>",

When Kadam is the victim of a hit-and-run that also claims the life of a street urchin, he goes into a coma for a month. After waking up, he finds a new sense of purpose and pursues the investigation into the identity of the driver on his own, when the police close the case for lack of leads. Kadam finds out that the driver was Balwan Khan, an over-the-hill Bollywood B-Movie actor. This brings him into direct confrontation with his ex-colleagues, who are now de factor gangsters in uniform and use Khan's movies to launder their money. A hardboiled crime-noir tale set in Mumbai and told though the eyes of Arjun Kadam, a washed-out drug-addicted ex-cop.</i></p>",

No one in the Valiant Universe is more terrifying, more dangerous or more experienced in the art of war than the undying Eternal Warrior. After thousands of years on the battlefield, he's a master of strategy and weaponry, an unrelenting force of nature capable of dismantling entire armies with little effort and less conscience. His brother Armstrong, on the other hand, likes to read poetry and drink beer. Maybe that's why they had such a bad falling out? But now - after years apart - the Eternal Warrior has a new mission: destroy young Obadiah Archer, Armstrong's best-est new buddy and teammate in the war against The Sect. And, like it or not, Valiant's history-smashing adventure duo is about to feel the wrath of the Eternal Warrior's fist and steel.</i></p><h4>List of covers and their creators:</h4><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Cover</th><th scope=\"col\">Name</th><th scope=\"col\">Creator(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Sidebar Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reg</td><td>Regular Cover</td><td>Patrick Zircher</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Pull</td><td>Pullbox Exclusive Variant</td><td>Doug Braithwaite</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Var</td><td>Variant Cover A</td><td>Emanuela Lupacchino</td><td>5 (and 4)</td></tr><tr><td>Var</td><td>Variant Cover B</td><td>Emanuela Lupacchino</td><td>6 (and 4)</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>Second Printing Variant Cover</td><td>Patrick Zircher</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>",

            "description": "<p><i>Fully half of this latest volume of Hal Foster’s epic masterpiece — again scanned from superb syndicate proofs — is devoted to the remaining chapters of “The Winning of Aleta,” a 20-month (!) epic in which Valiant obsessively pursues his bride to be. Not surprisingly this is followed by a sequence called “Matrimony,” which ends with a newly wed queen adjusting to the luxurious, exciting court life at Camelot.</i></p><p><i>But Val’s marriage does not signal an end to his adventures, quite the contrary. In “War in the Forest” Val is sent out to spy on encroaching Saxons — unknowingly aided by Aleta, who, disguised as a small knight (and dubbed “Sir Puny”) helps prevent disaster. But the 1946 strips end with Val and Aleta unable to return to Camelot and the displaced couple journeying to Thule…</i></p><p><i>Half the strips in this volume also include the delightful “The Medieval Castle,” Foster’s chronicle of two young boys growing up during the time of the First Crusade — but by the end of the 1945 strips this series has ended and the <b>Valiant</b> portion resume its full-page glory.</i></p><p><i>This volume also features a Foreword by P. Craig Russell, a gallery of Hal Foster's commercial illustration work and an essay titled \"Aleta: Water Nymph of the Misty Isles\" by Brian M. Kane.</i></p><p><i>With stunning art reproduced directly from pristine printer’s proofs, Fantagraphics has introduced a new generation to Foster’s masterpiece, while providing long-time fans with the ultimate, definitive version of the strip.</i></p>",

            "description": "<h2>Nanorigines</h2><p>After the assassination attempts on the dean of FEAH and the revolt of the students, the university resumes its education as normally as possible. For once is seems that everything will go as it should be, at least not until Sablon discovers that the rival school of Saint-Ange has devised yet another plot to shut down FEAH. They have used their polical influence to have the politcal world draw up a bill to reduce the number of superhero-schools. The only solution to save FEAH is to prove that it has existed for over 50 years. While the other students mount protests in the streets to slow down the voting, Chance, Xiong Mao and Ombre plunge into a investigation to reconstruct the history of their university. They seek the aid of a student of the third year to find the former Dean. In the midst of their investigation someone wipes their memory clean and they no longer know who they are. Now they no only need to find the orgins of the school but also themselves. To complicate matters a giant Legofigure wreaks havoc in the streets.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The Happy Prince is arguably the most famous and well loved of Oscar Wilde's nine fairy tales, rivaled only by The Selfish Giant. It is also a very timely tale at a time of controversy over the increasing chasm between rich and poor. The Happy Prince has lived a life of opulence but has died young, and his soul inhabits a beautiful ruby encrusted statue covered all over in gold leaf. From his perch high above the city he is witness to all the poverty, misery, and hopelessness in which his people have been living. When a small barn swallow in flight to the warm south ahead of the approaching winter stops to rest upon the statue the Happy Prince prevails upon him to delay his travels in order to remove his gold leaf a piece at a time and shower it upon the poor citizens. Out of love for the Happy Prince the swallow does his bidding. As the days pass the Prince's beauty is stripped away and as winter sets in the bird's fate is sealed. In the spring the townspeople finding only a dull statue with a broken lead heart and a dead bird consign the worthless objects to the ash heap. Only an emissary of God recognizes them as the most valuable treasures of the city and brings them to the gardens of heaven.</em></p>",
