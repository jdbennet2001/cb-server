            "description": "<p><b><i>Overview</i></b>\"Gifted\" pt. 1 (of 6). Dream-team creators Joss Whedon (creator of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and John Cassady bring readers the explosive #1 issue of the all-new flagship X-Men series. As part of X-Men: Reload, this issue marks a return to classic greatness and the beginning of a brand-new era for the X-Men.</p><p><b><i>Spoilers</i></b></p><p>Upon returning to the Institute, Kitty Pryde finds old memories and faces waiting for her. She also finds herself named as being a member of the senior staff of the Institute during the ceremony welcoming the new student body. The only member of the senior staff not present is Logan, who appears the next morning picking a fight with Cyclops regarding his new intimate relationship with Emma Frost.</p><p>This resumption of old animosities, with members of the student body watching, leads the Beast to call a meeting, during which Cyclops proposes a new direction for their group – returning to their roots as being super heroes, just like the publicly respected Avengers and Fantastic Four. They will gain acceptance from humans through actions they understand, not words they will not hear. Their first mission comes soon, as they leave to respond to a hostage situation caused by an apparent mutant and his gunmen at a benefit of some sort.</p><p>Meanwhile, world-renowned geneticist Dr. Kavita Rao makes a startling announcement at a press conference. She states that the mutant gene is not an evolutionary step but a disease; a disease for which she has found a cure.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>X-MEN: RELOAD ANOTHER CLIP! Jamie Madrox, stabbed, staggering off a bus. Jamie Madrox, setting up a detective agency in the heart of Mutant Town. Jamie Madrox, a peaceful Shaolin priest. Which is the real Jamie Madrox?</em></p><p><u><strong>Issue Summary</strong></u></p><p>It is night in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\">New York City</a>. The street is crowded with vehicles of every type, driving to their destinations under the illumination of their headlights, streetlights and the crescent moon above them. On the sidewalk, walking along it or using it to enter or exit any of the buildings lining the street, are throngs of people. One man among these throngs is a sweating, pale-faced young man, his right hand holding a wound under a bloodstained shirt, half hidden beneath his leather coat.</p><p>Walking among this sea of strangers, he thinks about this song, “Another Hundred People,” about people pouring into New York City by hundreds, into an ever-increasing faceless mass. It’s from a show called “Company.” And, if there’s anything he, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\" href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\">Jamie Madrox</a> – the Multiple Man, knows, it’s company.</p><p>Half-doubled over from his wound, Madrox makes his way to a cab, which another pedestrian has hailed. Despite the man being in mid-sentence to the driver about going to Lincoln Center, Jamie knocks him aside, entering the cab without a word. When the man protests, Madrox simply pushes him back, again without a word. Incredulous at being manhandled, the man beings to protest again, until he noticed a red handprint on his white shirt. As he stares down in disbelief, he finally receives an articulation from Madrox, who simply instructs him to close the door of the cab. When the dumbfounded man asks Madrox if it’s blood, he replies with a repeat of his order. <em>Close the door</em>. Then asked by the man if it’s <em>his</em> blood, Madrox sarcastically replies that it won’t be for much longer, then repeats his order for him to close the door, to which the man complies.</p><p>Now turning his attention to the cab driver, Madrox speaks the name of his destination. <em>Mutant Town</em>. Rather than acting on this, the driver replies with a “what,” causing Madrox to repeat his destination. As the driver begins to ask a new question, the irritated Madrox leans forward, asking if he has to say everything three times. Having been able to see what he suspected, that his fare is bleeding, <em>in his cab</em>, the driver grows angry, asking Madrox if he has ANY idea of the paperwork… If he dies, Madrox asks. Receiving an affirmative, Madrox asks for clarification: <em>Die in your cab</em>, he means. Exactly, the driver exclaims. To this, he suggests that he let him take him to the hospital…</p><p>Nipping this idea in the bud, Madrox informs the driver that it’s too late for that… so how about he take him to Mutant Town… and then he just has a fare… instead of a murder scene on wheels. When the driver points out that he could die en route, Madrox counters that so could the driver. If he gets his meaning. Declaring that he does, loud and clear, the driver speeds off. His immediate problem solved, Madrox takes a moment to once again ponder the city of New York, the Great Melting Pot. What a crock, he thinks. Get it? he thinks to himself.</p><p>Continuing, he ponders how there’s no real “melting.” Assorted groups cluster in different areas for mutual support and protection. There’s Chinatown… Little Italy… Christopher Street… and then there’s “<a data-ref-id=\"4020-42359\" href=\"/mutant-town/4020-42359/\">Mutant Town</a>.” Difference is, they don’t get tourists… unless they’re looking for trouble… or are just dumb. Or both.</p><p>On a dark street in Mutant Town, two youths sit on the steps to their building. After a redheaded young woman walks by, one of them whistles out. Gaining no response, the two begin to follow, the first calling out to her. The redhead pauses briefly, glancing out of her peripheral vision. Grinning devilishly, the first asks her to slow down and give them a kiss. She’s not mad, he asks. Hasn’t she ever heard a wolf whistle? Stating that, <em>aye</em>, she has, the redhead spins around. Now no longer a girl, she is a werewolf. Baring her fangs and claws and spitting saliva, she asks in a Scottish brogue, <em>Have ye</em>? As the two stare in disbelief, Rahne Sinclair aka <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\" href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>, asks the two of them to give her a kiss. Moments after the two turn tail and run, Rahne returns to her normal form and sighs. <em>Americans</em>.</p><p>Continuing on her way, Rahne approaches a lone, four-story building and enters it. Climbing up the stairs, she arrives on the floor in question and heads toward a nearby door. Calling out to Jamie, Rahne lets slip her Scottish brogue – temporarily eliminating her carefully crafted American accent, as a result of her annoyance at her situation. Having received no reply, Rahne comes upon the door, finding a hand-written sign taped to its window: <em>XXX Investigators</em>, followed by <em>J. Madrox, Pres.</em>. Not bothering to knock, Rahne twists the doorknob, announcing her entrance with the advice to Jamie that he might want to splurge on a professional stencil on the… Rahne’s words trail, as her view into the office reveals the collapsed and sweaty form of Jamie Madrox, his eyes rolled back into his head and drool dripping from his mouth.</p><p>Quickly bending to her former teammate and cradling his head, Rahne calls out to him, demanding to know who did this to him and swearing that they’ll pay for… Suddenly, Jamie regains consciousness and promptly thanks Rahne for coming; he knows how busy she is… teaching up at the school. Still concerned, Rahne asks Jamie if he’s all right. To this, Jamie smiles goofily, replying that he’s fine… feeling noooo pain… In a moment of clarity of the situation, Rahne rhetorically asks Jamie if he’s drunk. Jamie’s response – kinda, yeah – causes Rahne to drop his head, allowing it to violently impact on the unforgiving linoleum floor.</p><p>As is his lot – from his mutant power – the impact causes Jamie to spontaneously generate a duplicate of himself, exact in every form, including his clothes. In a way, he thinks, he is his own parade. His own best friend. And the only drunk who can legitimately see double. As the two Jamies begin to gather their senses, Rahne walks to the kitchen, taking off her coat, and announces that she’ll be making him some coffee. Upon her initial inspection of his kitchen, Rahne quantifies that she will, presuming that this swill counts as coffee. It looks like somethin’ the witches of Endor would’ve brewed, she opines – then suggests that they should scan it with Cerebra. Mutant lifeforms might be growing in it.</p><p>Still sitting on the floor, the Jamies begin to re-merge with each other, one pushing the other into his body – disappearing into him as if he were being immersed into a pool of water. Still sweating, the remaining Jamie asks Rahne to give him a break, okay? It’s not like he drank himself into a stupor. Did she smell any booze on him? Thinking about this, Rahne admits that she did not, now that he mentions it. Rising to his feet and pulling out a drawer from his desk, Jamie replies that, yeah, last night he waffled on staying in or going out, so he sent a dupe out to have a good time for him.</p><p>Taking this in, Rahne repeats <em>last night</em>, and asks if he was gone for… Twenty-four hours, Jamie replies. Yeah, apparently he had <em>too good</em> a time. Ripping open a moist towelette that he found in the desk, Jamie begins to wipe his forehead. Seeing this, Rahne tells Jamie that she thought he didn’t reabsorb damage that dupes sustained… Like elevated blood alcohol? he asks. No, but mental synapses, yes. And since the dupe’s brain was pickled, well…</p><p>How’s the coffee coming, he asks, changing the subject. Bringing to steaming cups to the couch upon which Jamie has collapsed, Rahne hands it to him, joking that she carved him a slice. Now changing the subject on her own, she asks him about the whole “detective” thing… why? And how’d he get a license? Answering the last question first, Jamie replies through an old FBI contact. As for the why… ‘cause, dumb as it sounds, he still wants to help people. Plus, he continues, with a wry <em>y’know</em>, he gets to meet gorgeous women.</p><p>Unconvinced, Rahne retorts that he’s been watching too many old movies. Plus, he knows bloody jack-all about detection. He… Rahne stops in surprise as Jamie sits up from the couch and grabs her chin by his right hand, examining her open mouth. Next, he grabs her ankle, lifting up her foot to examine the sole of her shoe, all despite her protestations. Reclining back, Jamie informs her that, on the way there, she stopped for a hot dog and relish at Nathan’s, gave a dollar to a homeless man, stopped by Midtown Comics to look at Muppet toys, stepped in a puddle at 32nd and 5th, and bought a copy of the <em>Daily News</em> but wound up giving it to another homeless man.</p><p>As Rahne takes this in, Jamie smiles inwardly, noting that his “Sherlock Holmes” riff should impress her. Finally managing to speak, Rahne stammers in question, <em>H-How did he…</em>? Sipping his coffee in satisfaction, Jamie merely replies that it’s a trade secret. Yep, he thinks to himself. Worked like a charm.</p><p>With the opening of the door once again, a new voice makes his presence known, with a simple “I’m back.” Turning to view the new arrival, Rahne is once again taken aback, as Jamie stands there. Unlike the Jamie Madrox still sitting on the couch, this Jamie is dressed in a monk’s robe, his head clean-shaven and a simple walking stick in his hand. Seeing that his “Kwai Chang” dupe has made his triumphant return, Jamie notes that he’s a week ahead of schedule.</p><p>Approaching the still-astonished Rahne, the monk Madrox addresses her, telling her that it has been several years. Receiving a startled <em>it has?</em>, Monk Madrox tells Rahne that she has grown into a fine young woman. Is she assisting with the office? Still startled but able to speak more coherently, Rahne replies just part-time, just to help… set up.</p><p>Deftly taking the mug from her hand, Jamie informs Rahne that there’s a bar downstairs across the street, called the Power Plant. Guido, he tells her, should be in about this time. He’d love to see her. When Rahne begins to protest, Jamie walks her to the door, telling her that he’ll be right down after he’s reabsorbed the dupe. As the monk Madrox bows in respect, telling Rahne for peace to be with her, Rahne tells Jamie that this is weird – doesn’t he see that? Closing the door in front of her, Jamie pretends to think aloud for a moment, before finally settling on the decision that it is not. Nope, no, not seeing that.</p><p>As the door comes to a close, Jamie recalls to himself that there’s a reason they’re called “private eyes.” It’s because they always keep aspects of themselves private; locked away so that no one… even their most trusted friends… can ever fully know them. Either that or no one wants to be seen in public with them. Yeah, he decides – that’s it.</p><p>Upon entering the Power Plant, Rahne is immediately addressed as “jailbait.” Looking to the bartender, Rahne sees a grey-skinned woman, with green octopus-like tentacles coming from her back. When Rahne asks her if she meant her, the bartender confirms it, lamenting that the liquor authority doesn’t hassle her enough for being a mutant bat. Now she has to worry about underage booze hounds?</p><p>Telling “<a data-ref-id=\"4005-59220\" href=\"/lefty/4005-59220/\">Lefty</a>,” to ease up, a hulking figure with monstrous-sized hands states that he’ll vouch for her. Turning around, Rahne finds herself engulfed in the gigantic arms of Guido Carosella. Hearing her call him by his former yet humorous nom de guerre of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7599\" href=\"/strong-guy/4005-7599/\">Strong Guy</a>, Guido winces. Make one joke at a press conference, he states, and you’re stuck with a name for life. Now calling out to Lefty, Guido orders a scotch and soda to his regular table. Same for the lady, he the adds, ‘cept hold the scotch.</p><p>A few steps later, the two make themselves comfortable at Guido’s special table – built on two scales. One side is regular in size, for the average-sized person, while the other side is constructed on a larger scale, conforming to his Brobdingnagian form. Craning her neck to look at Guido, Rahne asks him how things are going with Lila. She heard he and she were an item… Shrugging this off, Guido replies simply an “eh,” adding that he doesn’t like to talk about it. Surprised, Rahne asks “really,” stating that the word was the two of them were… Cutting Rahne off, Guido snarls his lip, repeating slowly and vehemently that he doesn’t. like. t’talk about it. Okay?</p><p>Getting the point, Rahne quickly asks if they can talk about Jamie. Hearing this, Guido’s stern countenance instantly transforms into a broad grin. Replying that, sure, <em>him</em> he’ll talk about, Guido states that he’s his best friend in the world. Well… he thinks to add, ‘sides himself. Frowning at this, Rahne looks downwards, replying that that’s her point. First he quit his job at X-Corp in Paris. Paris! Who’d want t’leave Paris? In response to this, Guido replies that, nowadays?, who wouldn’t? Ignoring this, Rahne adds that now he’s so… distracted. Distant.</p><p>Still smiles, Guido tells Rahne that she’s gotta keep something in mind. Jamie’s raised “keeping to himself” to an art form. His parents kept him isolated on a small farm, wearing a special control suit so he wouldn’t keep churnin’ out duplicates every time he <em>hit</em> something, or something hit <em>him</em>. Then, they died in an accident, and the kid was stuck on his own for months, ‘fore anybody found out. That’s gotta screw you up a bit. Plus, Guido continues, she knows about the dupes he’s been sending around, right?</p><p>Seeing that she doesn’t Guido tells Rahne that the detective thing’s a recent development. Before that, Jamie couldn’t decide what direction to go in his life, so he went in all directions at once. He’s been sending dupes the past few years to learn about various stuff. Then they come back and he reabsorbs them… and gains their knowledge. Thing is, he flakes out anywhere from a minute to an hour while his brain processes it. He <em>saw</em> it once, Guido states. It’s terrifying but fascinating…</p><p>Guido’s explanation draws to a close as he sees someone entering the bar. Recognizing him instantly, but detecting something amiss, Guido belts out an inquisitive <em>Madrox</em>? Stumbling to Guido’s table, a sweating and bleeding Jamie Madrox states, through barely coherent words, that he couldn’t make it… upstairs… to office… Though Guido still doesn’t know what is wrong, Rahne knows immediately, telling Guido that she smells blood on him. A lot! His own blood. Stepping forward, Rahne manages to catch the collapsing Jamie. Finally able to examine him more closely, Rahne tells Guido that there’s blood everywhere… she thinks he’s been stabbed.</p><p>Cradled by her, Jamie tries to sort things out through his delirious mind, asking Rahne what she’s doing there. At first, Rahne is confused, as he told her to wait there, until she realizes it’s a dupe. Understanding that as well, Guido runs to the street, stating that he’s on it. Rahne’s statement to go get the real Jamie, draws panicked ire from Guido, who repeats loudly that he’s <em>on it</em>! Approaching the door, he calls back to Rahne, telling her to cover her ears. Just as she begins to ask why, Guido stands at the door, his hands funneling his booming voice in a cupping motion, and yells out into the night sky toward Jamie’s building: <em>Maaaadrooooox</em>!!</p><p>Quickly making his way across the street and to the bar, Jamie thinks to himself that Guido sounded freaked… and he can’t even think about what could possibly freak Guido. Arriving at the door, Jamie finds himself pushed in by the massive Guido, to his dying duplicate inside. Finally seeing the reason why Guido was freaked, he decides that he doesn’t want to think about it any more.</p><p>Sitting next to the unconscious form of the duplicate, Rahne calls out to Jamie, telling him to hurry, and to reabsorb him. Hearing a stammering reply that he can’t, Rahne replies that she doesn’t understand. Likewise in the dark, Guido points out that the dupe is unconscious… it’s the only way. Hearing the real Madrox reply that he doesn’t care, Guido points out that if he dies without him taking his memories… “Still <em>not</em> caring!!!” Jamie retorts.</p><p>As the moments pass, Jamie tries to assess the situation. How can he explain to them that it’s happened to him before? A dupe, right on the edge… and he takes him… It’s like dying himself. Like… his soul’s being torn in half. He doesn’t absorb the wound… but the trauma of what he feels… felt… it’s… He just can’t.</p><p>Lost in thought, Jamie is returned to the present by Rahne’s pleas. He’s been stabbed, she tells him. A killer’s out there! If he doesn’t stop him…! His arms wide in feigned helplessness, Jamie asks if he does stop him - so what? <em>Another’ll</em> take his place! There’s always more killers, he states. That’s what humans do! Produce killers in endless supply. Fine, Rahne spits back. He can explain <em>that</em> to the families of his future victims.</p><p>Finding Rahne’s words biting, Jamie thinks that he hates that she’s right. He also hates that there’s another likelihood she hasn’t even considered: that this wasn’t a random assault. That someone’s targeted him, and they hit a dupe now. but next time… they might get him. Reaching down, Jamie places his forefinger to his duplicate, which begins to shimmer as it is reabsorbed.</p><p>(flashback)</p><p>A pain shoots/shot through Jamie. A scream cries/cried out. Drops of blood splatter/splattered. An elevated train speeds/sped. A picture of a brunette smiles/smiled up from a newspaper, dated March 24th. A skyscraper rises/rose into the air. A knife, bloodied.</p><p>Jamie smiles, dressed only in his trousers, and laughs at the night air, rain pouring down on him and the rock upon which he stands. He’s… alone. Truly alone. Just him… and God… and inner peace. No infinite number of dupes knocking around inside him, waiting their turn. Just a man… And his dog, he adds, as a collie begins to lick him. Okay. A dog. Dogs are good. Looking away, almost at someone else, the collie states that he’s coming around.</p><p>(present)</p><p>Jamie Madrox rubs his eyes. It’s no longer a dog hovering over him, but Rahne, a wet washcloth in hand. Taking stock of his new reality, as well as the one he just left, Jamie asks a flabbergasted Rahne if she was just licking his face just now. Replying defensively that she was not, she presents the washcloth. Right, fine, whatever, Jamie replies, managing to sit up on his couch. It figures, he thinks to himself. Bogart has Mary Astor. Russell Crowe has Kim Basinger. He has Lassie.</p><p>Sitting on the other end of the couch and reading newspaper, Guido welcomes Jamie back to the land of the living. When the befuddled Jamie asks how long he was out, Guido answers seventeen years. The U.S., he informs Jamie, was bought by the Swiss. The national bird is now the cuckoo, but the chocolate’s better. Now turning the Rahne, Jamie asks the same questions, this time receiving the more believable answer of twenty minutes – though it felt like seventeen years.</p><p>Helping Jamie to his feet, Rahne asks if he sees anything. The killer? No to either, Jamie replies. The dupe didn’t see his face, or it was so traumatic that he blocked it out. Taking a moment to lift his nose out of the paper, Guido asks nonchalantly if it was a random killing. Placing his jacket on, Jamie replies that he’s thinking not. His guess is that someone targeted him. The dupe’s thoughts were screwed-up… but they were also focused… on Chicago, he thinks. He saw the Sears Tower… and the El. And some woman. Of course, Guido confirms, there’s <em>always</em> a woman. Hearing this, Rahne congratulates Jamie. He got his wish. She hopes she’s gorgeous enough t’die for. Me too, he replies.</p><p>Rising from the couch, Guido asks Jamie what their next move is. There’s no “our,” Jamie replies. He’s doing this on his own. He takes being murdered pretty personally. With this, Jamie hits his fist against the wall, creating a duplicate. Addressing the dupe, as well as Rahne and Guido, Jamie tells them to stay there. He expects the attacker’ll be looking to make sure he finished the job… or even kill every Jamie Madrox there is. Hearing this, the newly created dupe realizes he’s bait – oh, joy.</p><p>Pausing at the door before leaving, Jamie turns back to Rahne and states that she never said – what does she think of the company name? Replying bluntly, Rahne states that it sounded like he investigates pornography. Closing the door to XXX Investigations behind him, Jamie thinks to himself that he can live with that.</p>",

Then, one day, an apocalyptic attack killed every man, woman and child, and reduced an entire society to rubble within hours. Now, Professor Charles Xavier -- legendary founder of the X-Men, and the man who dreams of peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants -- has come to Genosha with one intention: to rebuild a nation from its ashes. This brand-new X-Men: Reload series features stories and art from the creative team that brought you X-Treme X-Men.</em></p><p><b><i>Spoilers</i></b></p><p>In Genosha, Xavier thinks back about the destruction that his twin sister, Cassandra Nova, caused. Resolving his emotions, Xavier opens a secret compartment on the bottom of the coffin near him. He removes an outfit that seems more soldier-like and a handful of electronic devices, including weapons. Trying to pick the coffin off the ground, he is embarrassingly thrown to the ground by his own momentum. A ghostly Moira MacTaggert appears near him and questions him of his intentions in Genosha. Xavier tells the mirage that he plans to figure out what has caused the large spike in mutant births. Elsewhere, Unus watches Xavier from afar and commands his three lackeys nearby him to go to Xavier and teach him a lesson. Back with Xavier, Moira has disappeared and Xavier finds a new mutant named Wicked.</p><p>Talking to Wicked and seeing her powers in action, Xavier is stopped by Unus and his group as they show up to attack him. Xavier stops the three lackeys, while a new comer named Freakshow easily dispatches Unus. Xavier thanks the two mutants, Freakshow and Wicked, telling them that he would like to teach them, as he once taught the X-Men. After arriving at his destination, he psychically urges Freakshow and Wicked to go to bed. As the two of them walk away, Xavier turns around to meet an old ally, who has been waiting for him to arrive, the man named Magneto.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Whether she's going to school or hanging out with her friends at the Coffee Bean, Mary Jane Watson is always the life of the party. But what no one knows is that this gorgeous redhead's exuberant personality is a shell designed to make her forget about life's harsh realities. From her social life to her undying interest in becoming an actress to her crush on that costumed crime-fighter who swings along the New York City rooftops, it's clear that Mary Jane just wants to escape. Join MJ, Harry Osborn, Liz Allan, Flash Thompson and Harry's nerdy friend, Peter Parker, as they experience the thrilling highs and the crushing lows of high-school existence!</em></p><p>Queens, New York.</p><p>Liz Allan is trying to convince Mary Jane to go to the Homecoming Dance with Harry Osborn. Mary Jane protests, and says that Harry is like a brother to her and that she's looking for something more exciting. Liz tells Mary Jane that she's being unrealistic, but MJ already has someone in mind. As Mary Jane is called down to dinner, we get a glimpse of her bedroom wall which is covered in photos of Spiderman.</p><p>The next day in school, Liz Allan rushes up to MJ, complaining about her boyfriend Flash. Liz is extremely excited about the Homecoming Dance and really wants to be Queen, with Flash as her King. Flash, unfortunately, doesn't share the same ambitions.</p><p>Liz tells MJ that Flash missed the deadline for signing up, but that she managed to pull some strings and get him in. After she's done ranting, Liz begs MJ to reconsider going with Harry, so that they can all double date. Liz, MJ, Flash and Harry have known each other since they were children.</p><p>Just as Liz leaves, Harry pops up behind MJ, scaring her. Harry asks MJ if she's running for Homecoming Queen, and is relieved when she says no, fearing that it would drive a wedge between the four friends.</p><p>After school the four meet at a cafe, the Coffee Bean. Peter Parker approaches Harry, and asks him if they're still doing their science project together. Flash insults Peter, telling him to get a life. Flash asks MJ who she's going to the Homecoming Dance with, and Liz whisks him away, leaving MJ and Harry alone to talk. Harry gets up and goes over to Peter's table, where he consoles the insulted Parker. Impressed with his sensitive ways, MJ asks Harry out to dinner.</p><p>In gym class, while playing badminton, MJ spills the beans to Liz, who is absolutely ecstatic. Liz is happy that her friend has finally stopped fantasizing about Spiderman.</p><p>Friday Night.</p><p>Harry takes MJ to an expensive restaurant, where she feels awkward and underdressed. The menu is in french, and MJ is overwhelmed, but Harry says he's been to this restaurant many times before and orders for both of them.</p><p>After the restaurant, Harry takes MJ on a carriage ride through Central Park and the two reminisce about their childhood. Harry tells MJ that he never wants to hide anything from her, and wants to tell her everything. Mary Jane becomes uncomfortable and decides to go home.</p><p>Suddenly, the back of the subway car MJ is in bursts open and she is almost sucked out. MJ holds on and dangles out of the back as Electro and Spiderman tussle inside the car. Just as MJ loses her grip, she is saved by Spiderman. Spiderman disables Electro and takes MJ home, dropping her right outside her house. MJ asks Spidey how he knew where she lived, leaving Spiderman to give an awkward excuse and swing away.</p><p>The next day at the Coffee Bean, MJ tells Liz all about her brush with death. Liz, however, is more interested in how MJ's date with Harry went. MJ says that she doesn't feel like Harry is the right guy for her, and says that she'd really like to go to Homecoming with Spiderman.</p>",

Just because Peter Parker wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider doesn't mean he didn't do battle with a madman named Norman Osborn. Matt Murdock? Blinded, yes - but with no heightened senses.

Morgan (<strong><em>Altered Carbon</em></strong> and <strong><em>Broken Angels</em></strong>) and legend Bill Sienkiewicz (<strong><em>Elektra: Assassin</em></strong>, <strong><em>Stray Toasters</em></strong>) bring you old ghosts and new revelations about the original Black Widow -- Natasha Romanova -- in this hardboiled noir tale. The deadliest agent in the Marvel Universe has finally gotten out of the spy game, and she’s not asking for much, just a life of her own. When a sudden assassination attempt provides a harsh reality check, the former Soviet agent tracks a string of international killings that will lead her back to a Russia she can barely recognize.</i>",

            "description": "<p><i>In an arid world filled with decay and despair - where the faith of the people rests in a thirst for something to believe in - a mysterious girl with mystical powers of sight tries to find a way forward for her tribe.</i></p><p>The book begins with a history of the earth. We are informed that a giant sea creature called Stone destroyed five continents and drank the seas. From space the earth now looks brown, as all the oceans have been replaced by the Sakai or \"sand sea\": sort of like liquid sand.</p><p>On the Sakai, a gang of youths are on what appears to be an old oil derrick. They are anxious, because one of them named Zizi has been in the Sakai for over ten minutes. Suddenly, she comes bursting out of the sand riding what seems to be a mutant dolphin called a \"devourer\". They disappear back into the sand, and we get our first look inside the Sakai. It's full of floating half-skyscrapers and other ruins of civilization. Zizi comes up once more, this time with the dead devourer in tow. The youths congratulate her, but want to hurry up and return home. Zizi calls them cowards and tells them that the \"Black Current\" is straight ahead. It's revealed that Zizi is the only one with the ability to see the Black Current. The teens prepare to get in their boat and head home, but are interrupted by a roguish stranger passing by in his vessel. The stranger asks them if they know anything about a nearby \"treasure island\". Zizi sarcastically asks him if he's supposed to be some kind of pirate. The stranger responds that he prefers \"aggressively persuasive merchant\" and tells the group that he heard it was possible to catch lots of sand whales near the island.</p><p>Meanwhile, a tall tatooed man named Gaira is returning home from an unsuccessful hunting mission with his crew. They live on an ancient aircraft carrier, and the people are despondent. It's been three months without a whale being caught. As he disembarks from his hunting vessel, Gaira talks to an elder named Thunder. Gaira tells the elder that the lord of the Sakai appears to be deserting them, but Thunder tells him not to blaspheme. They go on to discuss Zizi and her ability to see the Black Current; Gaira is suspicious and considers them children's stories. It's also revealed that it's impossible for a normal human to see inside the Sakai. As they walk and talk, they're shocked to see a devourer hanging from a hook.</p><p>Nene and Zizi are deep within the carrier, bathing in the lake that surrounds the tree of hope. Nene notices the wounds on Zizi's arm and asks her how she got them. Zizi makes up an excuse and says that she fell, however Gaira enters and says they look like devourer bitemarks. We can tell that Nene has a crush on Gaira because her word balloon has a tiny heart inside it. Anyways, Gaira asks Zizi if she was really the one that killed the devourer. Zizi remains silent, and then he asks her if she can actually see inside the Sakai. He tells her of their people's history. Of how they came to their \"island\" 300 years ago riding on the back of a great sand whale. He tells her that she is different; no one else could have killed a devourer within the Sakai. Zizi stares at the tattoo on the back of her hand and her interior thoughts reveal that her parents had came to the island while they were pregnant with her. They never told her where they were from originally.</p><p>Zizi and Gaira walk up to the deck and continue talking. He asks her if she can see into the Black Current. Zizi sarcastically asks him why he wants to know. Gaira grabs her and tells her that the Black Current destroyed the ancient civilizations; if it comes they island it and everybody aboard would be destroyed. Zizi says that the last time she felt the Black Current was on \"Lighthouse Island\", about 10km west. She sticks her hand into the sand and tells Gaira that Black Current is not coming their way; however pirates ARE.</p><p>Captain Suv(the roguish stranger Zizi met earlier) hears from his crew that they're nearing the bountiful island. They ask for permission to land, but Suv denies the request. He tells the crew that the island is supposedly full of savage natives, and he wants to do some \"sightseeing\" first. At that moment, something attacks Suv's ship and destroys the stern. Suv asks what just happened, and a giant mutant whale called a leviathan jumps out of the water and takes another bite out of his ship. Suv pulls out a gun and shoots the creature, to no effect. Then Zizi appears in the sky with a harpoon in her hand. She pierces the monster and rides it away from Suv's ship. The leviathan attempts to dive, and creates a whirlpool in the sand. The leviathan surfaces again, this time Zizi is victorious. She has killed the monster. Suv is awestruck, and decides that he picked the wrong week to quit drinking.</p><p>Zizi reboards her island, while the other natives use their equipment to drag the sand whale aboard ship. The crowd celebrates her becoming a true whale-huntress. Later, she and her gang of youths take a raft over to Suv's sinking ship. She manages to persuade him to come aboard, while they tow Suv's vessel back to their island for repairs. The natives consider Suv to be lucky for bringing them the whale. Suv tells them that he heard the island was brimming with whales and wants to know if he can buy some. Gaira angrily tells him that the whales are sacred; and they have no intention of selling any to pirates. Zizi comes between them before matters can get anymore heated.</p><p>The natives hold a funeral ceremony for this killed by the leviathan. Zizi asks Suv where he comes from. He responds that he came from a long way south, and then asks Zizi why she wants to know. Zizi tells Suv to repair his ship as soon as possible, and she'll even help because she's going to come too. And she WON'T take no for an answer.</p><p>The natives have cut the whale open and extracted it's giant heart. To Suv's bemusement, they perform a ceremony and give the heart back to the Sakai. Afterwards, Suv comes across Zizi sitting next to a skimmer. She repeats that she's going with him, but Suv won't hear of it. She tells him that she can catch lots of whales for him, but Suv scoffs and tells her that she just got lucky. Zizi says that it was lucky for him, or he and his crew would have died. Suv reiterates that there's no way in hell that he's going to let Zizi leave with them. Zizi grunts and walks away. Later, Suv visits the location where the leviathan is being processed. He tries to speak to Gaira, but Gaira angrily tells him that he doesn't consort with pirates.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zizi is being prepared for her crimson tide ceremony the next day. Nene and her grandmother are excited because this ceremony will mark Zizi's transition to womanhood. Zizi, for her part, is annoyed.</p><p>Back at the whale processing station, the natives are shocked and horrified when a whale fetus or \"child treasure\" comes spilling out of the corpse. It's a major taboo in their culture to kill a pregnant leviathan. One of the workers becomes enraged and attacks Suv, blaming him for bringing the leviathan to them. Suddenly, another monstrous leviathan comes bursting out of the Sakai. Suv is excited, but Garai informs him that the whale is seeking revenge on the humans for killing his mate and unborn child. Suv is skeptical, until the whale starts to attack. Garai asks Suv if he's ready to fight, but Suv runs off. With his craft not ready yet, Suv and his crew board skimmers and hope to flee before the leviathan kills them. The whale starts to come after them, but suddenly Zizi comes rushing by on her own skimmer heading straight for the beast. She yells to Suv that if she kills this second whale that it will be skill and not luck. Suv yells back that she's crazy, but Zizi doesn't care. To Nene and Gaira's horror, she drives her skimmer straight into the creature's gaping maw and disappears. Suddenly the leviathan blows up like big balloon until **. Pieces of the whale go flying everywhere. Zizi emerges from the sand, covered in gore, but otherwise unhurt.</p><p>While Garai pulls Zizi out of the sand, and the other natives celebrate, Nene and Grandmother discuss the child treasure. The old woman tells Nene that ,for killing the pregnant whale, Zizi must be exiled. Nene protests, but her grandmother tells her that they cannot defy the will of the lord of the Sakai. Nene goes up to Zizi and tearfully gives her a hug. Zizi wonders what's wrong, but Nene won't tell her. Zizi declares to Nene that she needs to know where she comes form. Zizi swears that she will find it, even if she has to cross the whole Sakai.</p><p>The island natives throw their double celebration; celebrating both rescue from the leviathan, and Zizi's crimson tide ceremony. Zizi wears the ritual gown and enters the sacred room where men aren't allowed. She is told by a two attendants to step into a circle, as she does so she realizes that the circle is made of sand. Then, in a not-so subtle metaphor for menstruation, she is covered in whale's blood and her uterus begins to glow.</p><p>Meanwhile, Suv and his crew have returned to the island and face Gaira's scorn. Their vessel is almost repaired, but the natives have locked it up due to Suv's fleeing during the leviathan attack.</p><p>Back at the crimson tide ceremony, Zizi enters the tree of life. She sees a large group of stones, and a disembodied voice tells her to pick one. She wonders which one to pick, and eventually she chooses a small, black, smooth stone. The stone is warm to the touch. As she picks it up, she has a vision of a faraway rocky and cragged island. The voice tells Zizi that the stone is a part of her mother and father; it is her birthright. As the voice speaks, the stone is tied around Zizi's navel. She is told to carry the stone around her at all times because it will assure her safety.</p><p>The assembled crowd cheers as Zizi exits from the crimson tide ceremony. She tries to speak, but is interrupted by the grandmother. The old lady shouts that Zizi killed a treasure child and must be banished from the island. The crowd shouts their discontent, but Grandmother says the law is absolute. Suv and his crew sense the displeasure amongst the crowd and decide it's time they made their exit.</p><p>Nico manages to pick the locks holding their ship, and they prepare to shove off. Suv expresses some regret at Zizi's fate... until he realizes that she has also come aboard their vessel. He tries to force her to leave, but Zizi informs him that he abandoned his ship while trying to flee from the sand whale; therefore this is now HER ship. Nene comes running alongside the departing vessel, and manages to jump aboard; she is coming also, to keep an eye on Zizi. Frustrated, Suv allows them to stay. Suddenly, there's a loud clanging noise. Gaira has thrown his favorite harpoon at the moving vessel. Zizi sees him, and she realizes that he wasn't attacking them, he was giving her the harpoon.</p><p>As Suv's ship travels over the horizon, Grandma declares that Zizi may not have been born on the island, but she is their child.</p><p>It's been three days since they left the island, and ever since Zizi joined up, the ship has been followed by all manner of sand-sea creatures. Zizi loves it, but Nene is seasick, and Suv is annoyed. Suv tries to blast some of the creatures, but Zizi refuses to let him and blocks his shot. Suv asks her if the fish are ever going to leave them alone, but Zizi doesn't answer. Instead, she asks him about the Forgotten Continent where her parents were supposedly from. Suv tells her that if she wants to find it so bad, she should get off his ship and go jump on a whale. At that moment, a plume of sand rises causing the crew to think it's a sand geyser... until they become covered in whale blood. A whale explodes; Suv commands his crew to man their battlestations.</p><p>Aboard an ominous vessel, there stands a short, bald man dressed all in black. He is Commander Jango of the Imperial Fleet. An officer informs Jango that the whale pod has not altered course, and there also appears to be a fishing vessel amongst the pod. Jango wonders what a fishing vessel is doing way out there, and decides to teach them a lesson. His ship charges right at Suv's, but is slowed down when Zizi manages to hit it with a missile-spike(much to Suv's chagrin). Jango continues to plow towards them, but thanks to Nico's quick steering, they miss. As the ships pass each other, Jango drops several organic looking pods onto Suv's deck. Afraid that they're bombs, Suv orders his crew to throw them overboard, but the pods prove too heavy to move. Suddenly, the pods hatch and transform into lobster-men Crustaceans. Suv and his crew are outmatched and brought aboard Jango's vessel.</p><p>Suv tries to smooth-talk his way out of trouble, but Jango doesn't buy it. He tells Suv that he believes he and his crew to be enemies of the empire planning an uprising. Jango orders his men to kill their captives and scuttle their ship. Fortunately, Zizi(who had been hiding) jumps out and starts charging at Jango with Gaira's harpoon. A Crustacean steps in front of Jango to protect him; Zizi and the Crustacean battle. In all the confusion, Suv, Zizi, and the Crustacean are all knocked overboard. The Crustacean activates it's sand sensors, and prepares for an easy kill. It's shocked, however, when Zizi reveals that she can see inside the Sakai.</p><p>Jango rejoices as blood comes rising to the surface. He prepares to offer Nene to his crew as entertainment... until the dead lobster-man is thrown onboard. Zizi comes climbing out of the Sakai, carrying a passed-out Suv. She boastfully tells Jango that his Crustacean wouldn't have lasted five minutes as a whale hunter.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Episode 1: ZIZI The Witch With Pink Hair</li><li>Episode 2: The Magnificent Black Whale</li><li>Episode 3: Crimson Tide</li><li>Episode 4: Yellow-SUV-Marine</li></ul>",

Teaming with Cary Nord, whose stunning art redefines sword and sorcery with every panel, Busiek presents Conan's story from day one, in the manner it was meant to be told. Drawing largely from the original Robert E. Howard stories, the legend of Conan is brought to vivid life for the modern audience. Decades ahead of its time, Howard's stories can finally get the graphic treatment they deserve in this on going series.</p><p>Growing restless of village life, and thirsting for adventure, Conan travels north to snowy regions of Asgard. There he comes across an Aesir villages being plundered by Vanirmen. When he intervenes to rescue an Aesir woman, Conan finds himself single-handedly fighting off the Vanir invaders.</p>",

The front of their cells are not bars but a clear window. Harley taps on her cell to get Ivy's attention. She then holds up a sign that says I'm Sorry XOXXO. Ivy looks at her and cut the bud off the top of a rose she has in her cell. Ivy then plans her escape by cutting her thumb and dropping her blood in the flower pot. She then calls to a guard screaming about her cut hand. When the guard walks in she is attacked but Ivy's mutant rose plant. She grabs the guards gun and takes off down the leaving a confused Harley locked in her cell. Ivy goes a short way down the hall and kisses a guard who become brainwashed and lets her go.

            "description": "<p><em>WOLF AT THE DOOR PART 1</em></p><p><em>Comics’ First Family faces their most personal and unpredictable crisis yet in this edgy Marvel Knights series. Writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and superstar artist Steve McNiven pit the Fantastic Four against a challenge the likes of which they’ve never faced, and to overcome it they’ll need to call on the same humor, determination and family bonds that have delivered them from danger time and time again. This is the FF, the 4, like you've never seen them before!</em></p><p>It's a sunny day in New York and little Francklin Richards celebrates his 8th birthday in a special event organized by the Fantastic Four in the terrace of the Baxter building. His father Reed Richards gives him his own kid wagon which is a family heirloom and has a big meaning for him that the little kid cannot understand. Suddenly Mr Schultz the family's account enters the scene and interrupts the festivities. He has to explain that the Fantastic Four are from now on officially broke!</p><p>As the four heroes gather, he explains them that due to budget cuts the Government officials have decided to suspend their budget. Not only that, but their money manager was in fact a fraud who stole large amounts from high profile targets (like SHIELD and Osbourn Corporation). He suggests that they should change their current lifestyle and find suitable jobs.</p><p>The next morning our loving heroes try to find the new jobs that will support them and their loved ones. Sue asks Alicia for help and she manages to help her find a teaching position on a class full of problematic kids. Johnny visits his agent and tries to find an acting job with absolutely no success. The Thing gets a job as a construction worker when he saves the manager from being buried under ton of rubble. Mr Fantastic tries to explain the whole situation to Franklin.</p><p>But the most shocking thing happens in the ending. The Fantastic Four are being... evicted from the Baxter Building!</p>",

Continuing with the tradition begun in <i>Star Wars: Infinities— A New Hope</i>, we now give <i>Return of the Jedi</i> the Infinities treatment! When the plan to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt falls apart, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, and Chewbacca embark on another rescue mission that puts them into direct conflict with Boba Fett. Meanwhile, Luke’s late arrival on Dagobah ends with him being captured by Darth Vader and the Emperor, just as the second Death Star is about to go on-line! Will the <i>return</i> of the Jedi become the <i>end</i> of the Jedi? The surprising climax is as exciting as that of the film on which it is based, but different from anything <i>Star Wars</i> fans have seen before! Collecting the four-issue miniseries.</p>",

One day, he finds an old bloodstained Go board in his grandfather's attic--and that's when things get really interesting. Trapped inside the Go board is Fujiwara-no-Sai, the ghost of an ancient Go master who taught the strategically complex board game to the Emperor of Japan many centuries ago. In one fateful moment, Sai becomes a part of Hikaru's consciousness and together, through thick and thin, they make an unstoppable Go-playing team. Will they be able to defeat Go players who have dedicated their lives to the game? Will Sai achieve the \"Divine Move\" so he'll finally be able to rest in peace?

Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia--who is slowly regaining her powers--it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 1: Death &amp; Strawberry</li><li>Chapter 2: Starter</li><li>Chapter 3: Head-Hittin'</li><li>Chapter 4: Why Do You Eat It?</li><li>Chapter 5: Binda Blinda</li><li>Chapter 6: Microcrack.</li><li>Chapter 7: The Pink Cheeked Parakeet</li></ul>",

Kotarou's aloof cousin Tatsuki Oohira, also living with Grandpa, immediately gives Kotarou a hard time due to the fact that Kotarou unknowingly gave Tatsuki an unsettling postcognition when the two of them were children. Along with the help of Yuuto, a friendly classmate with the ability to see emotional auras around others, the three end up finding themselves in some dangerous mysteries surrounding their school and members of the community. Tatsuki and Yuuto find out their respective ESP abilities are heightened when they touch Kotarou, so they don't hesitate to do so when tracking down kidnappers and the like. Since Kotarou isn't informed that Tatsuki and Yuuto have psychic powers, he reacts like most teenage boys to the physical contact -- he screams, and hits, and tells them where they can put their slimy hands. And so our story is born...</i></p><p>Act 1 - 3.</p>",

Originally presented in LaLa DX magazine from Hakusensha between 1998 to 2004, the 9-volume LAND OF THE BLINDFOLDED is the story of high school student Outsuka Kanade who can sometimes see a person's future with a touch, and transfer student Naitou Arou, whose ESP is limited to past events. When Kanade glimpses an unfortunate incident coming, can she change it? She soon befriends Arou, who's no novice — he can turn his ability on or off at will, even using it to see an object's \"memories.\" Are these teenaged seers of the past and future made for each other? And who's right: Arou with his \"hands off\" policy about meddling in people's lives, or Kanade whose more proactive stance has already had unhappy consequences?</i></p><p>Chapter 1 - 3.</p><h2>Additional Stories</h2><ul><li>After the Festival</li><li>The Mistaken Man</li></ul>",

Jealous of her beautiful sister, Lady Akane savagely mutilates Orin's face, beginning a spiral of despair that ends in the suicides of both lovers at Lake Amada. The evil Akane, as fickle fate would have it, becomes the mystical caretaker of the lake, now brimming with a strange power. Thus begins a complicated web of revenge and redemption that spans two centuries. Jung's lush, expressive artwork, action-filled sequences, and expert sense of timing brings to life this suspense-filled tale, packed with ghostly encounters, samurai swordplay, undead armies, beautiful landscapes, and strange demons. The lost spirits of these two unlucky lovers may still find freedom, but their hope now rests on the supernatural birth of a granddaughter...and her ability to unravel the secrets of the restless ghosts that haunt her, the Kwaïdan.</i></p>",

The screams of his lady friends from several blocks away!</em></p><p><em>SMELL! Fred the Clown's scientifically improbable collection of fungal infections!</em></p><p><em>The signature creation of cartoonist Roger Langridge, Fred the Clown is the thinking man's idiot. Fred has an eye for the ladies, as well as several other organs, but the only part of themselves they're willing to share with him is a carefully placed kneecap...</em></p><p><em>Fred the Clown's misadventures are a curious balance of bleakness and joyful absurdism; the universe may dump on Fred from a great height, but he never gives up. More often than not, they involve the pursuit of a lady—any lady will do, it seems, but bearded ladies are at the top of the list. Disappointment seems inevitable, and it usually is; yet, almost despite himself, Langridge will occasionally give Fred a happy ending out of nowhere...</em></p><p><em>Langridge's comics betray a restless stylistic playfulness, a pessimism about human nature, and an absurdist perspective on human folly that can be traced back through Monty Python, The Goon Show and even as far back as Lewis Carroll. Fred the Clown's visual look often harks back to earlier eras, evoking the styles of (among others) Max Fleischer cartoons, classic newspaper strips, 19th-century illustration, the children's books of Maurice Sendak and Doctor Seuss, and more. The sensibility, though, is thoroughly modern—no classic style goes unsubverted, no narrative is left without ending in emotional ambiguity or a pomposity-puncturing ironic gag. Underlying it all is Langridge's own meticulous brush style. According to another New Zealand cartoonist, Hicksville creator Dylan Horrocks, \"If Samuel Beckett had teamed up with the Goons and learned to draw like Tex Avery, the result would have been something very like the comics of Roger Langridge.\"</em></p>",

The Avalon Chronicles were the perfect tuck-in tale and her parents enjoyed reading the fantastic fables as much as she liked listening to them. But one day, the book shifted tones. The unbelievably brave Dragon Knight and her courageous Prince faced an evil Wizard that threatened the entire land. But before they could finish the chapter, Aeslin's parents left on a business trip. When her father died on that trip, it was time for Aeslin to stop living in a fantasy world. Aeslin's mom never read from the tome again. Now Aeslin's a teenager and living a fairly ordinary life. She has a crush on Michael, the most popular boy in school, and her best friend Samantha loves to trade secrets and share gossip. It's a fine, if not extraordinary, existence until Samantha happens on a new book - Once In A Blue Moon. It's a sequel to the novel Aeslin loved as a child. The new pages catch up on the denizens of Avalon and their miserable eight-year existence since the defeat of the Dragon Knight. Aeslin can't believe it. She wishes she could be there to defend all of the creatures and common folk she loved as a child. And then out of nowhere, she is... Now Aeslin has the opportunity to be the hero she always admired. But Avalon is a much more dangerous place than she remembered and there's no instruction manual she can read to figure out what to do or how to get home.</em></p>",

His manic, spontaneous line, and his eye for facial expression, gesture, and detail make his cartoons more than one-shot gags. His humor is both erudite and puerile, as personally revealing as a drunken blackout and as politically trenchant as a lone gunman. Kreider's work has been likened to the foul result of inbreeding between Ralph Steadman and B. Kliban. The wide range of subject matter in this collection covers religion and politics to Nietzsche and pie, from sex and violence to the sheer pointlessness of it all.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>An anthropomorphic hipster cockroach is on the cutting-edge of American comic-strip humor. La Cucaracha (aka Cuco Rocha) and his pals voice the concerns and observations of the Latino-American community with an edgy, insightful wit. Through La Cucaracha, creator Lalo Alcaraz makes blunt social commentary both hard-hitting and hilarious. The result is not just a pleasure, but also a craving. The strong undercurrent of modern Latino themes and issues adds a sharp layer of meaning to the humor. In one strip, an immigrant bartender has listened to two customers rant, \"I'm telling ya, there's too many immigrants pouring into this country.\" When one of the customers asks for another drink the bartender declares, \"I'm an immigrant, and guess what? I'm not pouring!\" This first of perceptive La Cucaracha humor will delight and gratify all audiences that appreciate intelligent, progressive, deeply amusing comics.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Why are readers so dedicated to this simple comic about a boy and his dog? That simplicity itself is one of the best-loved characteristics of the strip. Ten-year-old Red and his lab-mix mutt, Rover, are a metaphor for friendship, and their shared adventures hearken back to a simpler time that holds a strong nostalgic appeal for modern readers. The other feature of Red and Rover that draws fans to the strip is the realness of its character. Rover is not a talking dog; he and Red communicate through thought bubbles. Moreover, Rover's facial expressions and body language are drawn with an authenticity, recognized and lauded by dog lovers, that communicates volumes about what he's thinking and feeling. As proclaimed on the popular family-oriented Web site infodad.com, \"Well focused, well thought out, and well drawn in something of a 'retro' style, Red and Rover is the most heartwarmingly funny new comic strip in years. Cynics, go elsewhere. Red and Rover is for the rest of us.\"</em></p>",

Lauren Moore is a brilliant young scientist and the creator of Cloudburst: a massive satellite designed to control rainfall on dry planets. Onboard a new colony ship carrying several hundred families, soldiers and cryogenically stored animal embryos, Lauren has been commissioned to use Cloudburst to terraform the planet. What Lauren doesn't know is the soldiers escorting the ship have been sent to remove the existing colonists to make room for the new ones. The corporate term is eviction.

Emily should be thrilled but instead she's terrified. You see, ever since she was a young girl, Emily has been somewhat of a hostel for ghosts. Visitors from the ether would drop in for a few days or a month or even years and from those specters Emily would draw inspiration. But lately the ghosts have disappeared, leaving Emily alone and unable to touch a canvas. When Simon's consciousness first shows up inside Emily's skull she's relieved, but before long she's fallen into the same web of mystics and murder that ended Simon's life. Can the unlikely pair discover the truth about Simon's gruesome death or will Emily join the spirits she's played host to all these years?</em></p>",

Known and loved the world over, the monster-smashing sci-fi superstar comes to Dark Horse courtesy of writer Tony Wong and Khoo Fuk Lung (Hong Kong's <strong>Solar Lord</strong>), with dynamic new covers by UDON.</em></p><p><em>This incarnation of Ultraman, now called \"Tiga,\" finds the 100-foot-tall hero revived in the year 2049 and facing a world ill-equipped to handle the onslaught of gigantic beasts that are peppering the globe. Relying on his martial-arts prowess and his three modes of combat, Tiga goes toe-to-toe with the most terrifying collection of monstrous giants and alien invaders ever to plague the planet. This volume collects issues #1-#4 of the series.</em></p>",
