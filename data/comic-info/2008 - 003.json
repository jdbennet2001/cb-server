            "description": "<p><i>\"Sex, Lies, and DVD\" continues with \"SIBLINGS\" -- the true(?) origin of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch! What horrible secret have these two shared and how is it now exposed? Does it hold a clue to solving the murder at the Ultimates' mansion? This issue guest stars Wolverine and uncovers the past...marching us closer to ULTIMATUM! The all-new epic saga of the Ultimates continues with superstars Jeph Loeb, Joe Madureira, and Chris Lichtner leading the way!</i></p><p>Wolverine is at Stark's Mansion and asks why they would simply let the murdered corpse of the Scarlet Witch be taken by the Brotherhood without asking why.  When they finally do ask why, he says that Pietro must have called his daddy.  Hawkeye is quick to defend Pietro saying that they've worked on several missions together.  Then he mentions that Wolverine used to be in the Brotherhood himself.  Wolverine counters with the fact that Hawkeye used to have a wife and kids.  Hawkeye is set off, calls him a \"mutie\" and begins shooting at Wolverine point blank.  Claws out, Wolverine pins him to the wall.  Hawkeye tells him to go ahead and do it.  The others asks Hawkeye what his problem is but he tells them to $@%&amp; off.  It takes Thor's booming voice to quiet everyone down.</p><p>Wolverine asks them how much do they really know about Pietro and Wanda.  He says they need to find out who killed her. Wasp asks why and Wolverine says because she's Magneto's daughter and could have been his.</p><p>He tells them about his time after the war and didn't have any place to go.  Hiking through the Balkan Mountains, he finally finds Wundagore.  He collapses before he gets there and is saved by Magda.  Years later he noticed the resemblance to Wanda.  Wolverine was looking for the Witch of Wundagore to help end his life.  They began getting intimate when an angry Erick Lensherr arrived.  Magda was his and he sends Wolverine flying down the mountain.  He couldn't find Wundagore again.</p><p>Years later he is called to the Brotherhood by Magneto.  That is where he meets Wanda and Pietro Lensherr.  When they are alone, Magneto tells Wolverine that his son is pathetic and weak.  He wants Wolverine to kill him.  Pietro and Wanda are off on a walk.  Pietro mentions that he wishes they could return to the Balkans, to their mother.  He mentions how she looks more like her everyday and they begin holding hands.  Wolverine takes this moment to jump at him.  He puts his claw tips into his chest so that he can't run away at high speed.  He just wanted to scare him off and give him a chance to get away from Magneto.  Wanda reacts to protect her brother and conjures up several dinosaurs out of nowhere.  Wolverine has no choice but to run from the stampede.<br /></p><p>Wanda mentions her concern to Pietro about not being able to control her powers.  Pietro says he will always be by her side to protect her.</p><p>The Ultimates and Wolverine decide to split up.  Wasp says she wants Captain America and Iron Man to stay in New York.  She says Tony is the best to figure out who designed the DNA bullet and Cap to be there when the story gets out to the public.<br /></p><p>They get ready to leave.  When Black Panther arrives, Wasp asks where he's been and where is Captain America.   Wolverine notices something is off with Black Panther but doesn't tell the others.  Iron Man arrives and Wasp asks where he's been.  He says he was going over the crime scene. The bullet was designed to only kill the Scarlet Witch and was made by Stark Enterprises.  He then removes his face mask to reveal what is underneath.</p><p>In the Savage Land, the Ultimates meet up with Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu.</p>",

            "description": "<b><i></i></b><h3><b><i>Overview</i></b></h3><b><i></i></b><p>The newly formed Teen Titans must face off against the possessed Justice League of America to the death! And in this battle, there are no winners. </p><p>Wonder Girl finds Wonder Woman surrounded by the police.   Confused, she asks Diana if she can help.  Wonder Woman says she doesn't need her little sister tagging along and pushes her away.  She then makes a move against the police and they have no choice but to fire on her.  Wonder Woman grabs a giant monument and throws it at them.  It would've been the end of them if Wonder Girl hadn't caught it in time.</p><p>Donna goes to Robin, Kid Flash, and Aqualad's secret cave.  She begins crying and they try to figure out how why their mentors are acting mean.  Robin decides that they need to stop them so that no one else gets hurt.  He comes up with the plan that they can work together to take them out one by one.  He also says that they can't go up against their own mentor since they would know them too well and how to fight them.</p><p>Robin, Kid Flash and Aqualad go after Wonder Woman.  Kid Flash narrowly saves Aqualad from a flying column thrown by Wonder Woman.  She walks towards them as they argue.  Robin uses this distraction to throw knock-out gas at her and ties her up with her own lasso.</p><p>Speedy and Wonder Girl go after Flash.  Speedy shoots an arrow at a neon sign to distract Barry and Donna punches him.  Aquaman and Green Arrow are taken out next.  They bring them all to the old JLA headquarters.</p><p>The only one left now is Batman.  Robin says that he's going along on this even though it was his idea that they shouldn't face their mentors.  He says he has to do this.</p><p>Before they can leave, a being calling itself the Antithesis appears.  It is not happy that they are ruining its plans.  He has been influencing the mentors to do bad things.  The more they do, the stronger he gets.  Batman then arrives.  Robin tries talking to him about the being's influence but Batman is as cold as ever.  The others figure they can take out Batman.</p><p>With the kids taken care of, Batman tells them they are all worthless.  Robin is the only one left.  Again he tries talking to Batman.  He tells him that he's become what he's been fighting all these years...a criminal.</p><p>Struggling, Batman manages to kick the demon out of him.  The Antithesis says it will not forget Robin as it disperses away.   All of the mentors are proud of what their sidekicks have done.  Except for Batman. He tells Robin he should've figured things out earlier.  The others comment on how great they did and how good it felt.  Aqualad says they should have a name.  Donna suggests the Titans after the Greek Rulers.  Aqualad throws in Teen in front and the others approve.  Wally mentions that Robin did a good job leading them.<br /></p><p>Before anything else can be said, Batman tells Robin to say goodbye to his friends because they are needed in Gotham.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>AMAZING FANTASY #15 introduced us to Spider-Man…and as it said in those pages, “As his first TV spectacular ends, Peter Parker breathes the first sweet scent of fame and success!” Now for the first time ever, writer Dave Lapham (TERROR, INC.) and artist Tony Harris (Ex Machina) explore the story of Peter’s heady days and sleepless nights living the celebrity life! As a wrestling superstar, show-stopping sensation and major moneymaker, this dweeb’s hit it big! But even before being forced to discover that with great power must come great responsibility, will the ol’ Parker luck rear its ugly head? How could it not?</em></p><p>Everyone seems to love the Amazing Spider-Man. Too bad J. Jonah Jameson isn't everyone. Sure, the rest of the press is filled with good news about Spidey, but Jameson thinks the web-head isn't all he's cracked up to be. What's he got to hide behind that mask? His wants his news team to bring him some dirt on Spider-Man.</p><p>Spider-Man is out on a date with a woman who's name he can't even remember. Not that it matters because he could care less what her name is. They're eating on a rooftop, watching the Fantastic Four fight some monster. Nameless date thinks the FF are pretty cool. Spidey says sure, if you're into fighting monsters and all that jazz. She gives him some lip service as the fight continues.</p><p>Spidey was supposed to spend some quality time with Tiffany Lebeck and she's none to pleased about his being late. She even knows about his date with the nameless groupie. Spidey apologizes and agrees to celebrating with her after his TV interview is over.</p><p>His first TV interview and Spider-Man isn't nervous at all. As cool as a cucumber, he makes with the jokes and the audience laughs. While Spidey shows off for the crowd, the people who handle the money at the studio look like they could have a problem on there hands. There's a fellow with shifty eyes sneaking around with a gun so if I had to guess, I'd say he was into some negative business.</p><p>Spidey's interview ends and he waits for the elevator door to open where he's just seconds away from a moment that he will regret for the rest of his life. A security guard shouts for Spider-Man to stop a thief, but what does he do? He lets him go. The security guard tells Spidey all he had to do was hold him up for a minute or trip him. Spidey says that's not his job and he's only looking out for number one--himself.</p><p>At a Club Mayhem, Monty and Tiffany are out celebrating Spidey's first TV spot. Tiffany tells Monty that he was a loser before Spider-Man came to boost his business and he'll be a loser when he's gone. Monty realizes that Tiffany wants in on the action. Threatening to fire her, Spidey shows up and says that if Tiffany goes, he goes. With that, Tiffany is made Spidey's official agent and manager.</p><p>Things aren't going so well on the home front. Uncle Ben gets a letter from Peter's school mentioning his absences and declining grades. He thinks Peter won't end up in a good school if he keeps going in the direction he's headed. Aunt May says Ben has always been like a father to Peter and maybe the time has come for him to start acting like a father would.</p><p>In the school halls Liz asks Peter if they're still going to study after school. Flash sees the two talking and he is one unhappy camper. He tells Peter if he sees him talking to Liz again he'll rearrange his face. Peter isn't intimidated by Flash's threat in the least.</p><p>Peter talks Liz into ditching their study session at the library and going to Club Mayhem. At the Bugle Jameson asks Ben Urich if he has anything on Spider-Man but he tells him he's got zilch. Jonah is convinced that something is there. As Peter and Liz leave the club, they get busted by uncle Ben. Liz breaks out the waterworks while Peter stays nice and calm. Just as uncle Ben is about to lay down the law, Peter's spider-sense goes off. He quickly pushes uncle Ben aside, saving him from some falling rubble. Why is it raining building slabs? There's a freak show attacking the city. Well that's one away to avoid getting in trouble with the folks.</p>",

Iron Man then demanded to know what was said, and ordered Maria to find someone who could decipher it immediately.</p><p>Meanwhile, the new abomination calling himself A-bomb, who is actually Rick Jones though it has not been revealed how he has become this new abomination, continued in heated battle with the red hulk. The red hulk started taunting A-bomb and kept calling him Rick Jones. A-bomb asked why the red Hulk was calling him that, and said he hates rick because he keeps him \"in the dark place\". They had then battled themselves right onto the base that was holding Bruce. After they crossed the gate, the defense measures of the base began, first with a large gattling gun that the red hulk tore out of the ground, and commenced fire on A-bomb. This did not hurt A-bomb much though, because he got right back up, and punched red hulk in the face. The next defense measure were robotic harpies with Betties face, though they also, were useless as both adversaries took care of them easily.</p><p>During the fight, the base began to come down, and the area around Bruce's cage began to crumble. Bruce started to bang on the glass, followed by sleeping gas coming out of the wall to subdue him. This doesn't work though, as on one panel you see Bruce's fist turn big and green.</p><p>A-bomb and the red Hulk continue to fight fight as the Hulk, yes the REAL hulk grabs the red Hulk by his shoulder who then said \"I'm gonna love this\".</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Your name is Nathan Summers. You’ve just met a nice Jersey girl. She’s blonde, soft-spoken, and she doesn’t mind the fact that you have a kid…or a bullet in your chest…or a big scary guy with a robot arm that wants to kill you. But you can’t stay here. The future of mutantkind is resting on your shoulders and the longer you stick around, playing house, the bigger the risk. Especially when an old friend comes blasting out of the past...</i></p><p>The issue begins with the lorry falling from the sky at Cable and the Baby, while Cable inner-monologues re-caping about what happened in the past two issues. The truck plunges into the road and destroys the front of the car Cable and the Baby were hiding behind.</p><p>Back to Bishop, and he's praying that this is the end. He then throws-up, apparantly because his \"Stomach's a wreck from jumping\". He tries pulling it together but he's hit on the head with the back of a gun by one of the gang members. The gang members talk about what Bishop did (levitating the lorry), and they realise that he is a mutant, and another member says that there hasn't been a mutant around since he was a kid. The leader realises if he is a mutant, that they'll get a lot of money for him, and they drag him off.</p><p>As the gang drag Bishop away, the waitress Bishop met last issue (Sophie Pettis) panics about the two who'd been supposedly crushed. Luckily, Cable's forcefield protected the two (Cable and the Baby), and he stumbles out from underneath the lorry carrying the child. Sophie grabs Cable's arm, trying to help him stand, and she tells him to come with her, she can take them somewhere safe.</p><p>He later lies, presumambly sleeping, on the floor of her apartment with the Mutant Baby clutched closely. Sophie tries to touch her but he opens his eyes and tells her no. Sophie tells him he passed out and she didn't mean anything by it. He tells her that nobabdy holds her but him, and she says fine. She then insists on getting him to a doctor because he's hurt so badly. Cable says there's no time for that, and tries to sit up but it causes pain. Sophie says that if she can't get him to a doctor, can she at least clean his wounds?</p><p>He asks if she's ever pulled a bullt out of a person, and she says she's held a gun before, and Cable replies saying that's close enough. He reminds her that he's the only one allowed to touch the baby, and she asks if he's going to stay awake through this? He tells her it's the only way to walk her through it.</p><p>Back with Bishop, and he's strapped and chained to a wall, and he inner-monologues. He realies that he's in one hell of a mess, and if he'd waited a few more seconds at the scene and he would've known if they were dead. He is being watched by several members of the gang. He also realises that he's followed Cable into a future that is possibly worse than his own, and that he needs to recharge, and there's only one way to do this. He begins to shout at the members, calling one \"mullet-head\" to begin, and talling him it must be tough patrolling the streets as a \"cop\" in those \"cute little ponchos\". The mullet-man tells him to shut up, but Bishop keeps going, asking if the bosses pick the outfits and do they come in pink? The mullet-man pounds him in the face with the gun, telling him to shout up again. Bishop asks another man if his wife loves a man in uniform? And then replying by saying that he probably loves a man in uniform. The all begin to beat him, and in his monologue, Bishop says for them to give him all they've got.</p><p>Back with Cable, and his wounds have been covered with bandages, and Sophie tells him that he should get some rest, but he insists that he has to get out of there. In his monologue, he realises that he'll have to go by foot until he fixes his time machine. But Sophie tells him that he has to rest, and he says fine, but only for a minute. He asks her about what happened, while the baby plays with a remote next to him. She tells him that the Turnpike Authority are suppsoed to keep them \"safe\". She tells him that when the big flood happened, the rich were prepared, and that they'd been stockpiling for years, and that they had secuity to keep others away, especially the hungry. Cable asks about the goverment, but she tells him that the rich became the govermentcalling themselves the \"New State Assembly\", and now the Turnpike Authority are free to do what they want. Cable asks what they want, and she tells him the usual such as taxes, complience and fear, and in exchange they let them have electricity and water and stuff, most of thetime. She tells him that there isn't much difference to what it wa like before, except now they kill, steak and rape.</p><p>As she continues to talk, we see a flashback where a man stands up the Turnpikes, and in return he gets shot in the head in front of his daughter. She tells Cable that there aren't many good men left, except for him.</p><p>Back with Bishop, and some fancy dressed men have come to seehim, the man telling him that he knows that he can do something, so why doesn't he show them? Bishop spits blood in his face, but it's whiped off by an accosiate and one of the gang members punches Bishop. Another fancy dressed man explains that they've taken time out to get there, and if he doesn't impress them they'll put bullets in his head. Bishop insults him, and the man gives instructions for the gang to beat him up, which they do. The man talks to him as a gang member strangles him, and after the man finishes, he asks if he's ready to co-operate? Bishop tells him that the man convinced him, and says that he'll show them what he can do, and at that moment a blue aura of energy begins to glow around him.</p><p>Back with Cable, and he says that normally he'd beat the crap out of these guys, but at this moment, the baby is his priority. Sophie understands, and says he should stay and rest, but he tells her that he isn't the man for the job. She says that he's a good father, a good man, and good men don't run, and he says that sometimes, running is the only option. She says he doesn't understand, the only reason she has the job as a waitress is because her brother used to be one of them, and that people are starving. The baby suddenly begins to cry. CAble says she needs milk, but Sophie says that you don't feed a baby cow's milk, but luckily she has \"vitamin-fortified protein water\", something she snuck home from the diner. They introduce themselves to each other (Cable calling himself Nathan not Cable) and he says that he's trying to prevent all of this, but she tells him that he's a bit to late.</p><p>Bishop breaks free of his bonds, and using the metal tentcles (see #2) he breaks one of the gang members neck's and grabs his gun and shoots at another. A man tries to hit him from behind, but using his robotic arm he slams him into a wall. He monologues about how none of this future will exist after the baby's gone. He believes he should bandage his wounds, but there's no time for that, not if Cable and the baby are still alive.</p><p>Cable and Sophie hear a craft flying overhead, and Cable asks if the Turnpike Authority have any aircrafts? She tells him no, and he hides the baby behind him, but Sophie tells him not to jump to concluions. He pulls a gun out, and as Sophie approaches the window she hears a large noise. Cable, believing it's Bishop, aims his gun for the door, knowing that Bishop is very resourceful. Cable coughs up blood, and drops his gun, and realises that hell has come knocking. Suddenly, the door is blown off it's hinges, and an older Cannonball enters, holding a gigantic gun, saying \"Damn, Cable. You look like $@%&amp;.\"</p>",

            "description": "<p>Wolverine lands, after being thrown through the air by Warren. A battle ensues with Warren, in firey-ash form, until he thrusts his hand into Wolverine's stomach. This causes Logan to have a flashback of him in a bathtub with Atsuko. He talk's of bringing her back the the States with him when he leaves Japan the following night. She says that she was born in Hiroshima, and will be proud to die in Hiroshima. He then pictures her bleeding, Warren with a sword, and the Nuke dropping. Back in the present, Logan is bleeding heavily from his stomach, while Warren is holding the heart he has just ripped from Wolverine's chest. Warren proceeds to swallow the heart and take Logan's coat. As Warren turns to leave, thinking Wolverine is dead, a gravely 'rrrr' comes from behind him. Warren attacks Wolverine, but to no avail as he is decapitated by the ol' Canucklehead. Things go white, and Logan is with Atsuko under a shade tree. She says that she can take away all his pain, but he will have to forfeit all memories of her. In doing so, this will sacrifice him of the pain of losing her. Out of the dream state, Logan regains consciousness as melting snow hits his face. He rises to find a beautiful sunset...alone in the woods.</p>",

With 72% of their multi-billion dollar, liquid metal Beta suit missing, and Julie Martin as the prime suspect, Raven is on the hunt and Julie is her prey! Don't miss this 3rd chapter of the exciting new series from SiP creator Terry Moore!</i></p><p>A fast-paced, exciting tale, ECHO begins literally with a bang and moves along quickly, dispersing just enough information and introducing new characters along the way to keep you interested and wondering what will happen next.</p><p>Issue #3 opens with a page recounting the story thus far, then plunges headlong into events. Julie is still confused as to what's going on with this metallic breastplate thing and is trying to figure out how to get it off. She's seen a doctor who, upon touching it, was shocked and wound up losing a fingernail. The doctor, feeling that Julie was playing some sort of prank, threw her out of the hospital. (This business was not entirely convincing; what kind of device would someone wear that would shock you and make your fingernail fall off? And why would a seemingly ordinary woman who is in obvious distress do that? Other than that, I was able to accept most of the plot points thus far.) As the breastplate stays on Julie longer, though, it gives her an almost soothing feeling.</p><p>In the middle of all this craziness, she's also in divorce proceedings. She's been trying to get in contact with her husband, Rick, but he doesn't want to have anything to do with her. Finally, she tracks him down outside his job and practically implores him to touch her breastplate, which, understandably, confuses him. She had previously met with her sister, now in a mental ward. While definitely suffering from major psychological problems–whose exact origins are yet undisclosed, but which have something to do with the seeming loss of her family--, the sister appears to have an intuitive sense about Julie. She even touches the breastplate and is not shocked. Julie wants to find out why she has no bad reaction to it, which is why she tries to get her husband to touch it as well. She wants to know why some people are immune to it, but with Rick even refusing to touch it, she's left wondering.</p><p>All the while she's trying to figure out what's going on with herself, the military is searching for her and their $2.5 billion experiment. They have gotten a satellite photo of the test site and she’s in it. They have also discovered that someone else was near the site as well, though they have no clear photo of them. As we discover, though, this other person might not possess good intentions with regard to the powers he or she has been given by the suit's fallout.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Written by Mike Costa; Art by Fiona Staples; Cover by Cully Hamner</p><p>Jack confronts the man responsible for last issue's horrific attack and finds a link to his own past. And there's something buried in the dead man's house that was specifically put there to throw Jack off the scent. But who put it there? </p><p><em>Includes Wildcats World's End special sneak preview.</em></p><p>Jack Hawksmoor awakes suddenly from a nightmare of strange computer signals, police reports, images of a woman at the Golden Gate bridge and horrific machines doing things to him while he’s trapped in a tank. When he jumps up from bed a nearby lamp explodes and a window breaks. Across from him he can see Juliet sitting on a chair drinking coffee and she’s already complaining, talking about how he’s destroyed her car and now her apartment. He repairs her window with a thought and apologizes. He goes on to explain about his sleep cycle, how he only needs rest once every few months and when he does sleep, it’s not good. He figures that getting blown up was enough for him to need an early recharge though. He looks under the sheets and asks if they did anything and she tosses him some clothes and tells him they didn’t. He passed out a couple of minutes after he arrived the night before. He gets on his clothes and prepares to leave when she throws her mug at the back of his head for not saying “thank you”. She’s mad because he spent two days asleep in her bed while she took the couch and she doesn’t even know who he is. She says that if he had been there one more night she would have called Stormwatch and he says it’s a good thing he woke up. He doesn’t like the people in Stormwatch and has so far been successful at staying under their radar. After that he decides to fill her in on who he is so he tells her his name and that he can talk to cities. She asks if it’s like Wilbur and Mr. Ed and he says it’s more like a TV and a broadcast antennae. He receives a huge amount of information and knows how to interpret it. She asks how he came to be like that, if he’s genactive and he tells her that no, he used to be a normal person until some people, bad people, kidnapped him as a child and re-built him. Juliet asks if they were the same kind of bad people that killed Ben and Jack says that it wasn’t, and that his bad people were gone a long time ago. Jack gets ready to leave so he can figure out what’s going on and she tries to go with. He turns her down saying he works alone, always. She asks why he came to her then and when he says it was a mistake she tells him she thinks it was a mad tired of being alone. She gets closer to him but Jack pushes her away telling her that she doesn’t know what they did to him. She takes out a cigarette and tells him that everyone has scars but love saves everyone. She turns her back on him and goes to the bed, dropping her clothes along the way. Jack follows.</p><p>Afterwards, Juliet is asleep and Jack is smoking and thinking. Talking to cities is as natural to him seeing and he realizes that explaining it was hard. However, discussing it had made him think and he discovered that there was something he had overlooked. There was also something she had said about the bad people that he couldn’t stop thinking about. While Juliet is asleep, or so he thinks, Jack sneaks out of the apartment. </p><p>Back at Ben’s house Hawksmoor is trying to locate something. In his mind he pictures entire city as a two dimensional disc and on that disc he can feel a hole like a gravity well. He goes into the house and his thoughts are jumbled into meaninglessness but he keeps walking, he knows what he’s looking for. In the room with the blueprints he feels something in the ceiling and breaks it loose. A golden hexagon falls loose and he crushes it. He thinks afterwards that it would have been best to be able examine it in a single piece but it was already causing enough informational interference that he could barely form thoughts. With it broken now he can see things clearly. The object had been lodged in the roof for a long time, whatever is going on isn’t new. Jack looks at the blueprints and figures out where the building was going to be built and heads out to look at the future site which just happens to be where the train exploded. When he gets over to the area he can see the hole in the ground and feels it aching like a scar. Before he can do anything though, one of the men from the other night reveals his presence and the fact that he has a shotgun. Jack turns to him and gets shot in the chest at point blank. The man says he knows it hurts but he also knows it won’t kill him. Jack gets up and after the man shoots him again he says he knows because he’s one of the people that built Jack. Hawksmoor flashes back to when he was being experimented on and changed and his rage brings him to his feet. He grabs the barrel of the gun and twists it but the man shoots anyway and is knocked back. Jack walks over to him and stomps on his chest before starting to question the man, asking him why he’s there, why he’s come back. Jack promises to kill all the people that come back for him and doesn’t know that behind him a wrecking ball has started swinging towards him. The ball hits him in the back and flings him through the air. When he lands he realizes that the man had one of the hexagons on a necklace and that’s why he had been totally blinded to the wrecking ball. The man runs and Jack goes after him. He sees that the man is hurt but thinks he’ll be able to catch him anyway. Instead, the mystery man runs up an electrical pole and surfs a power line to escape. Jack knows that without his powers he can’t follow or stop him. He sees that the chase has taken them to a bridge so he looks down and thinks about jumping. He can’t feel the traffic like he should be able to, can’t distort gravity like he usually can, and knows San Francisco won’t catch him, but he goes for it anyway. He lands on a truck and jumps onto another one but trips and falls onto a car. He tells the driver to drive, threatening to kill him if he doesn’t, and tells him where to go. Jack can’t talk to the city but he still has the map in his head and he can figure out where the man is going. It isn’t until he gets there though, that he realizes why. When the car nears the Golden Gate Bridge Jack sees the man getting into the robot that Hawksmoor had fought there days before. Jack’s driver brakes and tosses Jack before getting away and the man Jack was chasing greets him from inside the robot. The man taunts him saying, “City can’t help you now, pal.”</p>",

Is Tony Stark really a- -? And who's that guy with an eye patch coming to save the day?? And, oh man, who did he bring with him?</i></p><p>The S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier is floating in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. Commander Hill tries getting her crew to figure out where they are. Going up top she gets a surprise visitor. \"Jarvis\" is there asking for her complete surrender.</p><p>At Thunderbolt Mountain, Venom goes flying out the side courtesy of Captain Marvel. He holds Swordsman in his grip and prepares to deliver a fatal blow when Norman Osborn comes up to him, amidst the wreckage. He introduces himself and asks if he'd like to talk over what he's doing over a drink.</p><p>At Camp Hammond, Gauntlet, Taskmaster, and Diamondback prepare to move the recruits to their barracks since all their tech is down and they have no contact with the outside world. Yellowjacket staggers to them and informs them that the city's under attack by aliens. He says they need to get all the cadets suited up.</p><p>In Times Square, the Young Avengers are trying to save people and fight the super-Skrulls. Hulkling figures that perhaps he can talk to them since he is half Skrull and the son of Princess Anelle. Whether they understand him or not, they simply blast away at him. Things don't look good until the Initiative arrives.</p><p>In the Savage Land, \"Spider-Woman\" attacks Echo. Echo tells her she's not a Skrull and Spider-Woman says, \"I know\" and takes her down. She makes her way to where Tony Stark is trying to fix his armor and fight off the virus. Spider-Woman tells him he can relax, his work is done. She proceeds to tell him he's been such a brave warrior and will always have the love of his Queen. Tony has no idea what she's talking about and denies that he is a Skrull. She tells him that the truth had to be hidden from him. Tony doesn't know what to say.</p><p>Back in Times Square, the Skrulls don't seem bothered by the arrival of the Initiative. There are casualties as Vision feels their full wraith. It appears that the heroes have lost until everything around them begins to vibrate. A Skrull explodes as Nick Fury arrives with his Commandos.</p>",

            "description": "<p>It’s the Young X-Men vs. the new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants! A traitor is revealed and the casualties mount as the team goes to battle. We hope there are Young X-Men left when the smoke clears.</p> <p>*<strong><em>SPOLERS*</em></strong></p> <p>In the wake of the X-Men disbanding, Cyclops recruited a new team of heroes, made up of the last generation of mutants: Wolf Cub, Dust, Blindfold, Rockslide, and a previously undiscovered mutant, Eric Gitter, codenamed Ink. He gathered them in the ruins of the Xavier Institute and charged them with hunting the new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, whose members consist of Cannonball, Magma, Sunspot and Dani Moonstar, the former New Mutants. On their first mission, Rockslide, Wolf Cub and Dust ambushed Magma, while Ink and Blindfold tracked Dani Moonstar to her home in Colorado. After subduing Moonstar, Ink wheeled on Blindfold without warning and knocked her unconscious.</p> <p>What happened:</p> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li> <p>Manhattan, New York: Ink brings the unconscious Blindfold and Dani Moonstar to his mysterious employer. It appears that Eric works as mercenary, not taking part in any mutant factions. Meanwhile in L.A., the remaining Young X-Men's fight with Magma doesn't go well: She makes Dust into a glass statue. Rockslide remains intact despite her attack, but only Wolf Cub's cut from behind – risking a burn – scratches Magma and gives them a win.</p></li> <li> <p>Cannonball and Sunspot watch a newscast about the events in L.A. They know the X-Men are back and after them, meaning the surprise element is no more on the Young X-Men's side.</p></li> <li> <p>In the Young X-Men headquarters, Cyclops is spying on Sam and Roberto, listening to their conversation via a bug. Ink is back and tells Scott that Dani got her powers back and surprised Blindfold and him, and then took his partner as a hostage.</p></li> <li> <p>Above, in the ruins of the mansion, hides a mysterious kid. He watches Cyclops and Ink and talks to himself. Eventually the kid comes to a conclusion: He should kill Cyclops.</p></li> <li> <p>In an unknown location, Blindfold wakes up. Dani is standing above her and ready to beat her and get answers.</p></li> <li> <p>Santo and Wolf Cub tell Ink that Blindfold can't be dead, because she had a vision of the team – including her – fighting Donald Pierce. Eric is surprised to hear that he too will be part of the fight. Santo also says that Dust will be okay, as seen in Blindfold's vision.</p></li> <li> <p>Wolf Cub watches Magma in her cell, glad she is not dead. He tells Cyclops that at first he was okay with allegedly killing her, but later he felt bad. Scott says that he shouldn't feel bad, because there are not many options to deal with threats on Mutantkind post M-Day or the destruction of Genosha.</p></li> <li> <p>The use of the Danger Cave's recordings of people with medical knowledge to help Dust proves a failure. Rockslide says there is a need for someone smarter to cure her.</p></li> <li> <p>A Californian prison, the place is under attack. One of the cells is being breached from the outside by a guy who looks like Eric Gitter and shares the same abilities, but answers to the name Carlos. He came to free the prisoner residing in the breached cell.</p></li> <li> <p>Back to the unknown location, Dani still hits Blindfold. The latter says the name of Donald Pierce, who then shows up from behind Dani.</p></li></ul>",

When her teammates awake to find their nameless friend missing, there’s no way they can just let the matter go, no matter what the school’s headmasters say! Continuing the story of the offspring of the X-Men we know from writer who made the X-Men what they are today, Chris Claremont!</em></p><p>Also contains a back up by Kurt Busiek and Kyle Baker.</p><p>*<strong><em>SPOILERS*</em></strong></p><p> Ok, bekka awakens to an empty room and no name has completely vanished.

After this they only know she is still missing and the team may try something, Scott hopes not and wants to put pressure on them not to. Hank sees this as an x-men moment much like when they were kids but Scott cant as the x-men are disbanded and this is literally a school with no super heroics he laments that he cant have the kids do anything outlandish as if something goes wrong then the reality of the mistakes will have to be dealt with by him. Emma is attacked telepathically and seemingly taken over.</p><p>Bekka is being tested in the control and use of her power x23 cause her to lose control, Emma doppelganger makes her collapse and hank takes them all to the infirmary so he can check her vitals as a student finds Emma body all decked out in black.

            "description": "<p>(Tarnax VII, many months ago) <br/> Xavin continues his training under the tuition of Commander Chrell. Xavin is under pressure and sweats profusely. Chrell says, \"He loves you, Xavin, but you will fail him.\" He adds that he will fail the Skrull Empire. He will die and his loved ones will die because of him. He tells Xavin to try again. The young Skrull leaps into the air, forming his fist into that resembling the Thing's. As he punches, Chrell moves and Xavin's fist shatters the ground underneath. \"Too slow, my pupil,\" gloats Chrell. Xavin immediately creates a flame from the same fist and unleashes it at his teacher. Chrell is far too experienced to get caught out by that maneuver, and he reminds Xavin that his mind is his weapon. He should use it to out-think his opponent. He should win the battle before it <em>starts</em>.<br/><br/> </p><p>Xavin forms an invisible hammer, utilizing yet another of the Fantastic Four's powers. He brings it down hard at Chrell, but his teacher blocks the attack with his staff. \"No... that's not possible,\" gasps the young prince. Chrell replies that, even if he hadn't taught him everything he knows, Xavin is still telegraphing his attacks... even the invisible ones. He smacks Xavin to the ground with the staff and stands over him. He hopes Xavin makes a better groom than he does a warrior.</p> <p>Xavin admits that he is a failure. He is a disgrace to the great Kl'rt's name. Chrell informs him that Kl'rt fared no better when he faced him during <em>his</em> training. Even when he learned to use all of his powers together. Xavin should always remember that when you face a superior opponent, learn their weakness. Exploit them. \"That is the Skrull way,\" he adds with a wink.</p> <p>(Earth, New York City, Invasion   49 minutes) <br/> X'iv watches over the city from high on a ledge about two thirds up the Empire State Building. She hears the screams and panicking of the populous below, and finally hears Dorrek's name mentioned. She informs Chrell by radio that her target has been re-acquired. \"Prepare to receive.\"</p> <p>Down below, Speed rockets from a subway station past the running crowd, having decided not to take a trip on Xavin's invisible discs. Xavin is annoyed. \"I said <strong>low profile</strong>! Is he <em>insane</em>,\" she asks Teddy. Possibly, he replies. Probably, adds Wiccan. Tommy runs off, telling them that he's going to check on the others. Wiccan calls after him but it's too late. Xavin says they should forget him and keep moving, but Teddy asks where to. Speed is right. They have to get back to their team. Xavin turns and asks if he's been listening. Doesn't he understand? He can't help them by <em>dying</em>!</p> <p>Teddy asks what he's supposed to do. If he's this big savior, what is he supposed to do? Xavin doesn't have an answer for that particular question. She thinks that they should broadcast to the entire Skrull armada. They have to know that he is alive and that he is there. They have to know that their prophecy is a lie and that there is a different way. They ought to know that this invasion is the work of mad Skrulls and not the love of Gods. They need to find a satellite uplink; some kind of communications center. Teddy informs her that there is a TV network on Rockefeller Plaza. It's close by so they can broadcast from there. As he speaks, Tommy returns and tells them that they have to go. Nick Fury is in Times Square. \"Vision is...\" Before he can say what has happened to their friend, a circle appears around them. It’s too late for Xavin to warn them as they disappear into thin air.</p> <p>They reappear in a heap, some distance away in a large plaza. Xavin and Dorrek are deposited a short distance away from where X'iv appears. She is carrying Tommy in one half of her cloak and Billy in the other. Teddy warns her to let them go. Xavin says that he knows her. She is X'iv, right? They trained together on Tarnax. She asks her not to do this. The prophecy is wrong. She <em>has</em> to listen. A voice behind them says that X'iv <em>did</em> listen. Xavin turns and gasps. Standing there is her old tutor, Commander Chrell. He stands with one foot on Old Lace's neck, as Klara looks over the sleeping Molly. He has Chase, Victor and Nico trapped inside invisible forcefields and his elasticized arm wrapped around Karolina - his fingers gripping her throat. Chrell tells Xavin that he has always liked her. He always has. She did her duty for the Empire and he respects that. Now she can do her duty for her God.</p> <p>Xavin pleads with him not to do this. She says that he said he didn't believe in the prophecies. Chrell admits that he doesn't, but what is happening here is divine right. He tells Xavin that she can have her bride back, and together, she and her Majesdanian tramp can go anywhere in the universe. But first, she will kill Dorrek for him, because the Skrulls do not need a savior. They have Earth. Meanwhile, Klara tells a recovering Molly that she doesn't know what to do. She starts to cry and wishes she was elsewhere. Xavin's fist bursts into flames, and Chase asks her not to do this. They can take them together. Xavin replies that she cannot. Chrell trained her. She cannot defeat him. She tells Teddy that she is sorry. Klara grinds her fingers into the dirt and wishes she could go to the City of Angels. \"Make it go away.\" All of a sudden, a huge tree shoots up from the ground and slams into Chrell, whose hold over his four captives and Wiccan is loosened.</p> <p>Instinctively, Nico starts formulating a plan as soon as she lands. She tells Victor and Chase to help Tommy and Billy. She and Karolina will... Nico can't even complete her sentence before Karolina is up and pouring her rainbow-colored energies on Chrell. She is furious and swears at him. \"Leave my fiancé <em>alone</em>. Do you hear me?!\" she cries. \"And I am not a tramp, you chauvinistic $*@!!\" Molly is impressed. She didn't even know Karolina knew words like that. Chase is awestruck at her ferocity. Victor attacks X'iv. \"Let them go, lagarto!\" he warns, as he slams into her torso. X'iv responds with a solid right hand punch which knocks Victor backwards. Chase uses his new gauntlets to fire missiles at her. Chrell gets up and informs Xavin that her choice was poor, but it's no surprise to him. She was never a particularly good student. He begins speaking in Skrullian. \"Oh, no!\" exclaims Molly. \"He's a parseltongue!\" Nico asks Xavin for a translation. \"Enough games. Kill them all,\" she replies.</p> <p>They look up to see that X'iv has taken to the air and is preparing to strike. Xavin asks Nico which part of 'run away' did she not understand before. Nico quips that she's all for trying again. As X'iv prepares to fire, Hulkling puts himself between them and takes the brunt of the blast. Xavin then dashes towards Chrell and asks Dorrek to stay alive. X'iv grabs a sai and hurls it at Teddy, but he manages to avoid it and he asks Nico if she's okay. Did she hit her? Nico's cheek is cut, and she replies that she is, but it's only fun and games when she gets hurt. She utters the magic words, \"When blood is shed, let the Staff of One emerge.\" The staff shoots from her chest and into her hand.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Xavin and Chrell begin their battle. Xavin fires a burst of flame at him, but, as he did in the past, he avoids it easily. He warns Xavin that Dorrek will die, and that any Skrulls foolish enough to believe in him will see the truth. Their 'savior' will never be found. He protects himself against shards of invisible forcefield thrown by Xavin and then becomes entangled as they both use their elasticity to try and place each other in a stranglehold. Chrell grins as he believes he is superior. He warns Xavin that the invasion is done. This is as it is written. No Skrull or man can change that. He attacks Xavin with spikes of forcefield energy that hurt, and follows this up by punching Xavin in the face with his 'Thing' fist which is now on fire. Xavin falls to the ground, hurt. She tells Chrell that she doesn't want to fight him, but Chrell replies that he would hardly call this a fight. She still can't even use her powers concurrently. How is she going to beat him?</p> <p>Chrell picks Xavin up by the throat and holds her high above him. Xavin tells him that she is a Skrull. She knows his weakness and will exploit it. \"And what is my weakness?\" asks Chrell, defiantly. Xavin replies that his beliefs are empty and filled with hate, yet <em>she</em> believes in her friends. From behind, Karolina attacks Chrell once again and he is forced to drop Xavin.</p> <p>Elsewhere, X'iv blasts Old Lace with a beam of energy fired from her eyes as Chase leaps at Wiccan, saving him from a blast of darkforce. Speed grabs Molly and Klara and deposits them safely several hundred miles away. Molly shakes her fist as he returns to the battleground. Klara is in awe at the sight presented before her. \"Mr. President!\" she exclaims. Speed rushes back to Manhattan just in time to get hit by a darkforce blast from X'iv. Nico is winded by a burst of light from X'iv's other hand. Chase is hurt by a billy club. X'iv is using her powers well. Hulkling punches X'iv, but she gets up quickly and warns him that his friends will not save him. Their powers dwarf theirs. All he has to do is die. She attacks him with her sais, but Teddy replies, as he tries to avoid being pierced, that he is the son of Princess Annelle and the Kree named Mar-Vell. It is his destiny to save the Skrull Empire and to unite their people. He tells her that she knows the prophecies. She has read them. But there is only one truth and it is he. \"I was chosen by out God. He speaks to me,\" he adds, \"And he told me he does <em>not</em> love you.\" X'iv's eyes widen upon hearing this, and this momentary lapse in concentration allows Dorrek to headbutt her which knocks her out cold. \"Sucker,\" says Teddy as he stands over her defeated body.</p> <p>Teddy asks if everyone's okay. Chase can't believe that the Skrull's secret alien weakness was getting head-butted. Nico asks where Xavin is and Billy asks where Karolina is. Teddy turns and sees Karolina and Xavin in a fierce battle with Commander Chrell. \"Over there... fighting my fight,\" replies Teddy.\"</p> <p>Chrell warns them that they can send a thousand children. It will not matter. Xavin asks Karolina to keep pouring it on. Chrell creates a forcefield to hold them off, and Xavin begins to sweat. Karolina asks what' wrong. Xavin replies that Chrell is going nova. They have to get out of there, now! Chrell's body becomes hotter and hotter. He tells Xavin that despite her failure, '<em>he</em>' still loves her. Xavin surrounds Chrell with a forcefield and struggles as the strain takes its toll. She must hold the field in place. Chrell's face suddenly shows concern and he asks what Xavin is doing. Her powers are not strong enough to beat him. As he goes nova, he cries out before exploding into a pile of Skrullian bones.</p> <p>Xavin releases the forcefield and collapses, only to be held up by Karolina. \"He was right,\" she gasps, \"My weakness beat him. I cannot use my powers together... but it has made me stronger... individually... I did it... I... saved...\" Karolina lays her down and hopes that she is okay. Xavin turns to her and says she is better for seeing how scared she was for her. Now Karolina knows that Xavin is okay, she asks how she could tell Nico to <em>leave</em> her like that. \"Don't ever do that again, do you understand me?\"</p> <p>Watching them, Dorrek reckons that was kinda harsh, but Billy just says she was worried about him. \"Can we never come to New York again?\" Chase asks Nico. \"Done,\" she replies. Karolina asks what now. Billy tells them that they have to get back to Times Square. The rest of their team is there and they have to help. Teddy tells Xavin that she risked her life for him, despite him turning his back on all his responsibilities. She still believes in him. Why? Xavin tells him that to <em>not</em> believe in him; in the savior and the uniter, is to not believe in hope. She chooses to believe in hope.</p> <p>Teddy kneels before her and tells Xavin that she is his savior. He thanks her. Nico places her hand on Billy's shoulder and tells him that they are the super heroes. Do they have a handbook for this? What's the next step in the 'alien invasion' chapter? Billy asks her to get out of there. They're heading back in. Nico thinks not. No more running. They're <em>in</em> this. Billy replies that it's not running. It's prevention of suicide. He asks her to take a look at her team. Even their dinosaur is trashed. Besides, he adds, if they lose, they've gotta come and save them. Nico resigns herself to acknowledging that Billy is right. She asks him to win. They've lost enough friends.</p><p><br/></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The Anti-Life Equation has infected Gotham City, turning friend, foe and family into mindless slaves of Darkseid, and the might of the Spear of Destiny has left The Spectre powerless. Can The Question find the answer to restoring hope inside the one being capable of saving the world?</i></p><p>The issue begins with Mercy retelling what god gave all of us, the choice to sin an the choice not to. Those who sinned were cast away and those who didn't were saved. Then she comes to her senses as the Anti-Life controlled citizens of Gotham slam onto the three heroes. Spectre,and Mercy huddled together in a force field created by the Spectre. As Mercy tells how she died Sister Clarice she attempts to calm the citizens, yet to no avail. She comments that it should have worked and Spectre tells her it happened to him when he confronted Libra that its God's idea of a joke. Mercy barks at Spectre telling him that God doesn't joke with life. Commenting to herself that she speaks to him with authority she does not feel.</p><p>Outside the Question tries to defend herself from Batwoman. The woman she once loved under the control of Darkseids Anti-Life equation, Batwoman continues to beat the life out of Question. Question tries to beg an reason with Kate(Batwoman) but to no avail, she strikes Question down slamming her fist into her back. The pain is almost too much for Question. All the time Mercy can feel the pain from Question, and soon the fight is stopped with Spectre screaming \"ENOUGH!\" as he blasts Batwoman. Spectre believes if god wont allow him to restore Kate then she shall be ended by his hands. Question jumps in front of Batwoman telling him that she cant control the evil she is committing that she is under control of the Anti-Life, Spectre comments thats even worse. Mercy does not want to see anymore bloodshed and she teleports Question,Spectre and herself out of the area for the safety of them an the ones around them.</p><p>Cain and his followers continue their trek towards Spectre, Cain stops and comments on the work he has done already that his father would be proud. His followers commenting on what he has already done, he tells them that its almost over that this is nothing that awaits once he is revenged upon god.</p><p>Back with Spectre an company he comments that this is what God wanted. That he has abandoned them, leaving them powerless to do anything against what they are fighting against. Soon the Questions wounds become too much for her an Spectre points out the damage, soon afterward Mercy places her hand on Question and heals her. Spectre then grows angered that god allows Mercy to heal Question while his power is bit by bit whittling away, that he was unable to stop Libra because god wouldn't allow it. That why was she spared and not his brother Jake.</p><p>Soon more people come to the church they are in looking for help, as Question helps them in Mercy in her human form gasps in surprise. Spectre now in human form comments that the people outside who are being controlled are stopped cause they are protected, but Mercy interjects saying that they are waiting. Spectre asks waiting for what ?. Question tells them both she already told them, it was all in the Crime bible. The people are waiting for Cain that he has the spear and is coming for Spectre. Mercy continues with what Question was saying, telling Spectre that Cain is after him because he was the one who took him down that Cain is coming back for revenge....revenge upon god by killing Spectre. Mercy finally seeing something is up with their powers pointing out three men in the church asking if Spectre feels anything if god is pointing them out, when Spectre says no she tells him that they were the three that killed her. She walks up to them turning into Mercy asking if they remember her to look at what they did to her. They plead to her telling her sorry and asking for forgiveness, she replies \"I don't know how to.\" then Questions gaze turns to the door as she tells them \"HE'S HERE\".</p><p>Cain is outside goading Spectre to come out an stop being a coward, to come out an fight him. Surrounded by his people who worship him along with the ones controlled by the Anti-Life. Soon Spectre does as he is asked an comes out fists swinging, Cain laughs at his attempts at fighting telling him he is using his fists when he has great power at his disposal. That Spectre knows nothing of vengeance and gouging out Spectre's eye out, as Spectre writhes in pain Cain tells him \"I birthed murder...allow me to demonstrate.\" And plunges the Spear of Destiny into Spectre.</p>",

As he fiddles with a pair of pliers, firey laser shoots from the glove, destroying the radio. This surprises Chase, but Molly appears at that moment asking what he's doing. Although Chase attempts to hide the out-of-control glove, Molly picks Chase up and carries him to the Runaways' team meeting.</p><p>(moments later)</p><p>Carrying Chase over her head, Molly enters the lounge. Nico begins the meeting with her first issue - the Majesdanians are returning, seeing as their ship must have went to pick them up. Sitting in the middle of the living room is vaDanti, who won't cooperate with the Runaways. He reminds Karolina that she cannot hide from Majesdane's soldiers. They tracked her across light years. Navigating a planet is nothing.</p><p>Victor tells him that they don't want to hide; they want to avoid any more fighting and work out a peaceful resolution between them and Karolina. Nico immediately attacks vaDanti with a ream of questions; she wants to know where they are and when they will arrive, whether he can communicate with them and what they can do to stop them from attacking. Her final question is, \"What they we do to avoid a fight?\" Smiling maliciously, vaDanti barks \"Surrender,\" immediately angering Chase. Victor and Xavin restrain him. Karolina shouts for everyone to stop it; they're not getting anywhere with violence and anger.</p><p>Karolina begins to speak, but this doesn't get vaDanti to cooperate. Finally, Chase suggests they should just load up the Leapfrog and find the Majesdanians themselves; they can get the jump on them. Xavin, however, suggests she can make a speech and bring truce between Karolina and the Majesdanians. Molly suggests they build a fort. Klara suggests she give them flowers. Nico suggests a spell to make vaDanti speak... but a silent Karolina watches as the others all make suggestions and excuses for her, and suggests her own solution: give herself up.</p><p>Finally, vaDanti agrees with her - he tells her she is finally making sense. This causes the other Runaways to angrily turn to him and tell him to shut up. But fed up, Chase storms off for work. Xavin stalks off to make her speech - she will save them with diplomacy. Molly and Klara angrily run out to build their fort. This only leaves Nico, Victor, Karolina and Old Lace with vaDanti. Nico is stunned with how the others just walked away. It is at this point where even Old Lace leaves the room. \"Perfect,\" groans Nico. Karolina leaves as well.</p><p>(the Antarctic)</p><p>deHalle is freezing. A penguin stands there, as if it's interested in what she is doing there. The spacecraft appears above her and her powers kick in. With a beautiful rainbow lightshow, she takes off and enters the craft from underneath, rejoining the General who is at the controls. He asks if she is okay. deHalle replies that she is fine, but can't wait to get her hands on that little witch. The General says they have one more stop and then she will get her chance.</p><p>(Malibu)</p><p>Molly and Klara take their suitcase to build a fort on a hill in Malibu. Lying on the grass, Klara asks why the sky is so brown - back in 1907 New York, it wasn't this dirty. Molly assumes it is pollution. Molly looks out over the sea and says that any minute now, she's gonna see way more than pollution up there - the Majesdanians will be arriving, but they will be safe in their own fort, like the second raptor in Jurassic Park. As Molly crushes a rock into powder, a smiling Klara looks up at the sky. \"Ships that sail in the sky. Parks filled with dinosaurs. I'm never going to get used to this century.\"</p><p>(KZIT)</p><p>At KZIT radio station, Chase arrives for work to find that Val Rhymin is exhausted. Val, who doesn't seem to be in the right mind, asks Chase to come closer to his face. Val asks him to do a favor for him. Chase is eager to hear. After a long pause, Val tells Chase to jump out the window.</p><p>Chase, however, stands up and laughs, assuming Val was joking. At this point, a call comes in from \"Mother\". Val suddenly jerks alert and active and orders Chase to pick up his dry cleaning. Depressed, Chase resigns himself to the task and departs. Val says that if he passes this test, then next time he might try something a little harder, like washing his car. He gets back on the phone to Mother and apologies. He then asks, \"So... Mother... what do you know about zombies?\"</p><p>(the African plains)</p><p>The Majesdanian ship arrives in Africa to pick up vaRikk, whose also picked up a lizard he decided to nickname \"deHalley\", after deHalle. The General tells them to buckle up; he wants to get back to Los Angeles as quickly as possible.</p><p>(Malibu)</p><p>On the beach, the sun sets as Xavin (in her young adult male form) is at a beach party with their neighbors. Nico, shocked that Xavin could be partying at a time like this approaches Xavin, acting as though she is his daughter. As the neighbours watch interested, Nico asks Xavin if she should come back inside the house - they have their \"guests\" arriving. Xavin, deliberately acting dumb, pretends not to know what Nico is talking about. As Nico begins to get infuriated, Xavin tells her she already wrote a speech. Nico can't believe that she's just going to sit there and do nothing. Xavin, covering her eyes from the neighbours, reveals her bright vivid Skrull eyes and tells Nico that has her own plan, and Xavin has hers. Nico storms off, angry.</p><p>Nico heads back to the house calling for Molly and Klara who don't respond. Victor, meeting up with her, reminds her they are building a fort. Chase is at work. Xavin is having a beach party. Molly and Klara are playing. Karolina is writing a letter of surrender... and any second now, a Majesdanian warship is going to arrive and blow their house off the map. Nico doesn't understand why anyone isn't working together... they're falling apart. Going in different directions...and finally, a shocked Victor figures out what their problem is.</p><p>Inside the house, vaDanti watches them through the large windows. With no one to watch over him, he uses his energy powers to destroy his metal bindings. His wrist band beeps and something gluttonous spills out.</p><p>Victor tells Nico that he understands what their problem is. He knows why everyone's acting strange and <b>scatter</b>ed... and Nico finally gets it. Her scatter spell that sent the Majesdanians over the world had side-effects: it appears to have emotionally scattered the Runaways...</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>This issue marks the first mention of \"Mother\", who would actually appear in issue #7 (February 2009). In this issue, something gluttonous and slimy spills from vaDanti's wrist band - this is the infamous bubble that will be the focus of the next issue, #4 (November 2008).</p><p>The 1960 film 'Psycho' is referened by Chase, while the 1993 film 'Jurassic Park' is referenced by Molly. Rocky Balboa from the 'Rocky' films is referenced by Xavin. Chase notes that Val has a Porsche.</p></div></div>",

It was during the chaos of the Bakumatsu that this shining jewel of a city was plunged into violence and bloodshed. The Shinsengumi, an elite corps of deadly warriors, crossed swords with Kenshin more than once in those days, but what has become of their legacy in the new Meiji Era? An old foe, Saitō-Hajime of the Shinsengumi, comes to pay a call at the Kamiya Dojo, but is his visit purely for revenge or a harbinger of much darker schemes to come?</i></p><p><i>Then, on May 14th in the 11th year of Meiji, tragedy strikes. Ōkubo Toshimichi, chief of the Department of Internal Affairs and one of the most powerful men in Japan, is assassinated in broad daylight, but who could be behind such a fiendish plot? It appears that the ghosts of Meiji's bloody past are threatening to wreak havoc on this new age of \"culture and enlightenment\"--personified by Shishio Makoto, the man who took Kenshin's position when he ceased to be Hitokiri Battōsai. Though Kenshin has foresworn the taking of lives, he heeds the call and departs for Kyoto, knowing all too well that Shishio anxiously awaits his arrival!</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Volume 7: In the 11th Year of Meiji, May 14th</h4><ul><li>Act 48: Resurrection of the Wolf</li><li>Act 49: Wolf Without Mercy</li><li>Act 50: Scheme</li><li>Act 51: Confrontation</li><li>Act 52: The Wolf's Fangs</li><li>Act 53: Agreement</li><li>Act 54: The One Who Stops the Two</li><li>Act 55: Enter Ōkubo</li><li>Act 56: Meiji 11, May 14th - Morning</li><li>Act 57: Meiji 11, May 14th - Afternoon</li></ul><h4>Volume 8: On the East Sea Road</h4><ul><li>Act 58: To Kyoto (Part I)</li><li>Act 59: To Kyoto (Part II)</li><li>Act 60: Megumi's Feelings • Kaoru's Feelings</li><li>Act 61: Man Without Emotion</li><li>Act 62: On the East Sea Road</li><li>Act 63: Makimachi Misao</li><li>Act 64: Playing \"It\"</li><li>Act 65: Each to His Own Path</li><li>Act 66: The Abandoned Village</li></ul><h4>Volume 9: Arrival in Kyoto</h4><ul><li>Act 67: Birth of a Small Champion</li><li>Act 68: A Portrait of the Ambitious</li><li>Act 69: The Tactics of Battle</li><li>Act 70: The Sword of Heaven</li><li>Act 71: To Kyoto, Once More</li><li>Act 72: Encounter in the Forest (Part I)</li><li>Act 73: Encounter in the Forest (Part II)</li><li>Act 74: Arrival in Kyoto</li><li>Act 75: Searching for the Sakabatō</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>Our third volume (of six) of the acclaimed hit series collecting the entirety of E.C. Segar's original Popeye (a.k.a. <b>Thimble Theatre</b>) comic strips features work from 1932 to 1934. In addition to the daily and Sunday strips, this volume will present a true collector’s item: Segar’s never-reprinted two-week “World’s Fair” continuity. In 1933, in addition to the normal daily and Sunday continuities, Segar produced a special, two-week sequence of extra-large strips (two to three tiers each) in which Wimpy and Popeye travel to Chicago to take in the World’s Fair. Olive Oyl is left behind on account of “she ain’t wide-minded,” but Olive has other ideas and follows Popeye to make sure he isn’t flirting with any pretty girls. This sequence has never been republished since its original publication 75 years ago.</i></p><p><i>Stories in this volume include \"The Eighth Sea,\" a nautical thriller-diller starring, in his only appearance in the actual Segar Popeye strip, Bluto (plus the shape-shfiting detective Merlock Jones); \"Long Live the King\" and \"Popeye King of Popilania\"; \"Star Reporter,\" in which Popeye juggles his career as a newspaperman and a recent adoptive Dad to the one and only Swee'pea. Plus over a year's worth of great full color Sunday strips, many of them focusing on everyone's favorite glutton Wimpy!</i></p><p><i>This volume also contains the conclusion of Donald Phelps’s incisive and articulate critical essay on Segar’s work “Real People, Real Theatre.”</i></p><p><i>E.C. Segar blended complex narratives, slapstick traditions, brilliant characterization, and an inimitable cartooning style to create the most exciting and profound humor of his era, rivaling the great film comics of his era, such as Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers. Discover this American treasure in this handsomely designed series perfect for all ages.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>1 &amp; 2 Kings and 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles tell the history of Israel and Judah following the Davidic dynasty through the exile in Babylon. Against this historical backdrop of the rise and fall of maneuvering kings and warring empires, the fictional series Kingdoms traces in vivid manga style the saga of the dedicated advisor Iddo and his descendants. As he remains loyal to the memory of the just King Josiah and labors to keep his nation faithful to the Lord, Iddo struggles to protect his own family. Destruction looms from the East… while danger lurks within. When the Lord calls him as the prophet to the nations, Jeremiah doesn’t know that faithfulness to God often results in mistreatment from others. As he proclaims the word of the Lord to Judah, false prophets and royal officials try to silence him. But as Babylon’s army surrounds Jerusalem, the king and people of Judah must choose either to heed God’s instructions, or suffer destruction.</em></p>",

Of course, there’s always Leonie, the terribly gifted girl who doesn't put up with Ducoboo's messing and doesn't believe in sharing knowledge. Of course, there’s also the teacher, whose index finger turns out to be more threatening than ever… No, school life isn’t one long, smooth ride: For some, the school year is perhaps the most dangerous time of all!</em></p>",

Defending wartime America from Nazi airships, ape-men and anything and everything else the Axis can throw at them, the Human Torch and Toro burn up the comic page like it's still 1943. Captain America and Bucky parachute into adventures from mad scientists to buzz-bombing Nazis. Meanwhile, the Destroyer stops at nothing - including a battalion of Hitler impersonators - to stop the Nazi threat. And the Pacific Theatre won't be left waiting, not with the Sub-Mariner around! He takes it straight to the Emperor himself and comes back to clean up the docks while he's at it! But before you speed away, don't miss the Whizzer as he races through maddening mazes and thwarts the plans of kidnapping crooks!</em></p><p><em>Collects All-Winners Comics (1941) #9-14.</em></p>",
