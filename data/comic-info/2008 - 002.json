It’s Captain America vs. Sabretooth, Iron Man vs. Mystique…and Thor vs. Valkyrie?</p><p>Plus: Which mega-popular character (nope, not Spidey) makes a surprise appearance on the last page? The dream team of Jeph Loeb, Joe Madureira, and Christian Lichtner continues to rock the Ultimates!</p><p>Spider-Man is swinging through the city and decides to hitch a ride on top of a passing police car. He becomes slightly distracted when he hears the police radio report shots taking place in the Radio City Music Hall area because Aunt May was supposed to be checking out a show there. Suddenly he feels a sharp pain in his arm and flies off the squad car. Hawkeye appears with guns out in full force, shooting at him. He tells him he should've stayed down. Spider-Man recognizes him as Hawkeye even though his appearance has changed slightly since he last saw him. He asks if the rest of the Ultimates realize that he's crazy. He replies that maybe he is a little crazy ever since he hears a gunshot and starts thinking about his family. He trails off then says maybe it's all an act just to mess with him.</p><p>Spidey starts shooting webs at him. Hawkeye tells him if he wanted him dead, he'd already be so. He was just looking for Black Panther since his buddy Venom just threw him ten blocks in this area. He knows from the S.H.I.E.L.D. files that they are somehow related. Spider-Man then gets the drop on Hawkeye and encases him in webbing. Unfortunately he then passes out from the dart he was hit with. Hawkeye tells him he'll be out for about twenty minutes and points a gun to his head. He tells him if he finds out he had anything to do with Venom visiting them, he'll be taking a permanent nap. Captain America arrives and knocks the gun away. He tells him the mission has been aborted and he is to report back to the mansion, ASAP. As they're walking off, leaving Spider-Man behind, Hawkeye asks what about the Panther. Cap just says he's his responsibility now.</p><p>Just earlier that night, Wasp is by Hank's side after he was found unconscious, surrounded by pills. Pietro arrives with his dead sister. He tells her that he kept radioing for help but no one responded. Wasp claims they never got a message. Pietro whispers, \"My father was right.\" He then tells Wasp that this never would've happened if they stayed in the Brotherhood.</p><p>Their conversation is interrupted by a power failure at the mansion. Tony Stark is barely conscious after having drank so much alcohol. Thor and Valkyrie are in bed. There is a huge explosion at the mansion. The Brotherhood has arrived. The team consists of Mystique, Sabretooth, Blob, Lorelei, and Madrox.</p><p>Tony Stark stumbles to get his armor on in response to the attack. The Black Widow appears at his window. He can't believe she's there since he's been drinking and she's supposed to be dead. She's about to attempt to kill him when she gets zapped by Wasp. As she lies on the floor, she changes and reveals she's really Mystique. Wasp tries telling him about Wanda being dead and that they are under attack. She asks how sober is he. He says \"Sober enough\" and gets dressed.</p><p>Thor and Valkyrie decide to get dressed and join the battle. Lorelei appears behind him and suggest he \"kill the girl.\" He agrees and attacks Valkyrie.</p><p>Blob is in the kitchen raiding the fridge when Wasp tries zapping him. He threatens to eat her too when Iron Man appears from underneath, carrying him through the roof and away from the mansion.</p><p>Captain America and Hawkeye arrive. Cap tells Hawkeye to shoot to wound but Hawkeye notes that with the Multiple Man, there's always more. Sabretooth tries attacking Cap from behind.</p><p>Down below, Magneto arrives. Pietro says he knew it was him when the power went out. He tells him it is now time to be with family. Pietro isn't exactly happy to see him since he shot off his kneecaps the last time they saw each other. Magneto said he healed, Wanda won't. Pietro asks how is supposed to know that he wasn't responsible for her death. Magneto tells him to look inside and asks who would be better at finding the killer, the Ultimates or the Brotherhood.</p><p>Upstairs in the middle of the battle, all of the Brotherhood disappears. They recognize that Pietro must have taken everyone out. Wanda's body is gone too. Wasp says they need to find him even though they don't have a lead.</p><p>Then Wolverine arrives telling them that they have a bigger problem than just trying to solve a murder.</p>",

Its wall-to-wall action and the end of an era for one Avenger and a major defection for another.</em> <em>This double-sized issue ties into or wraps up threads from Civil War, World War Hulk, both Avengers titles and the upcoming Secret Invasion!! Avengers writer Bendis welcomes rising star Carlo Pagulayan on his Avengers debut...</em></p><p>Maria Hill recieves word of the break-<i>in</i> at the Raft. When she sees the list of those missing, she realizes that it's every single person they just brought in from the \"bank think in Jersey.\" The Raft wasn't prepared for a mystical break out.</p><p>In Tigra's apartment, she is visited by the Hood and some of his new teammates. Holding a gun to her head, he demands to know where the \"new\" Avengers are otherwise he will kill her and her mother. She says they are in Dr. Strange's house. Even though it appears to be boarded up, everyone in the Initiative knows that's where they are. They just can't prove it. She tells them in the hopes that they will go and get their butts kicked.</p><p>At Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorium, Jessica, Danielle, and the Night Nurse are enjoying some tea and gossip. The team arrives from a successful mission. They're all beat. Suddenly Dr. Strange collapses and orders no one to touch him. Outside, The Hood and all the bad guys he's gathered stand waiting to attack. They're still not sure if the Avengers are really there. The Hood tries using his powers to peer through the illusion. Then Spider-Man is spotted leaving. As soon as he's out, his spider-sense goes off and he rushes back. Yelling, \"They're Here!\" no one knows who exactly he's talking about. He grabs Danielle and takes off. Luke has no idea what Spider-Man is doing and gets ready to follow him. Clint notices that the protection seal on Strange's place is turning into leaves. Chemistro was able to change the properties of it. Jessica catches up to Spider-Man and her daughter, cursing the whole way. He tells her there was no time to explain. He tells her to take Danielle and get as far away as possible.</p><p>Inside, the Avengers think they are still under Strange's spell that prevents outsiders from seeing or hearing them. The gunshots directed at them tell them otherwise. The Hood enters and shoots Strange several times in the chest as he lies on his bed. Wong takes on the Hood. Jigsaw gets Jessica and Danielle in the sights of a sniper rifle. He is stopped by Spider-Man. Night Nurse tells Wong that Stephen isn't breathing. Luke is outright ticked off that they came after his baby.</p><p>As the fight is setting off fireworks, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents become aware that something is going down. The Hood is about to shoot Iron Fist from behind when he is attacked by Tigra. Night Nurse tells Wong they need to call someone. Stephen is dead. Then his eyes light up. Getting up slowly, he tells them (again) not to touch him. It looks like the Avengers are simply too outnumbered. Strange appears, growing larger and begins chanting some mystical spells. Everyone in the room is frozen in a painful scream. Wong is speechless after witnessing this. Night Nurse tries going to Stephen, who is unresponsive. Wong finds a book he was looking for. Going to each Avenger, he says a chant and touches each one. Painfully, they awaken.</p><p>Stephen begins to explain what he has done. Lately he has used darker magics. He was arrogant and thought he could handle them. He says he has failed them as he had failed helping Bruce Banner. He can no longer be the Sorcerer Supreme. He has to atone for what he's done. Apologizing again, he says he has to leave. WIth some waves of his hands, he disappears.</p><p>Ms. Marvel and her Operation: Lightning Storm agents arrive. She asks where Jessica and the baby are. Luke says he's not sure, out there somewhere. Carol, reluctantly, tells him to go find them. Surprised that she's not going to arrest them, she then calls the helicarrier requesting Brother Voodoo and a clean up crew to take care of all the bad guys. She's asked what about the rebel Avengers. She says they got away. She turns to her agents telling them that's what happened. One argues that he can't go along with it. She reminds him that she's stronger than he is. Luke thanks her. She asks what they'll do next. He has no idea.</p><p>The Hood managed to escape. Talking to himself (or maybe his demon) he says he did everything he was told to do. Then he says that now he knows how to stop them.</p><p>Outside Stark Tower, Jessica, with Danielle crying in her arms, desperately tries to get someone to let her in. She's ready to register in order to protect her daughter.</p>",

But where do you go, what do you do, when everybody you knew is either dead and buried or in old-age homes, and the future you thought you were fighting for turned out to be radically different from what you imagined?</p><p><b>Spoilers!</b></p><p>Several months after the last issue, the Blue Blade is found murdered in an alleyway by the Phantom Reporter. Flashback to earlier events:</p><p>The group ride a bus to their new home. They witness the change in New York as they drive to an estate where they will be allowed to live for the next year free of charge. It is meant to be a gift for their service to the U.S. Government during WWII. They will be allowed to come and go as they please. Laughing Mask asks what's the catch. They are told that it is the hope that they will continue to act as heroes. If so, they are allowed to stay there.</p><p>Dynamic Man is ready to leave. He says he was born for the future.</p><p>Captain Wonder receives some information he requested and leaves. He says he'll be back. For him, sixty years ago he had a wife and kids. His wife died of a heart attack and his kids were killed in Vietnam. When he visits their grave he recalls the day he left to fight in Europe. His wife was concerned for his safety. He promises her he'll be back, saying he's never broken one before. He tells her to believe. On her tombstone, the inscription reads: \"Come the Darkness, I still believe.\" Captain Wonder is left in tears.</p><p>Richard, the Phantom Reporter, walks through the house, checking things out. As he walks by Master Mind Excello's room he notices that he's making a phone call. Richard says he'd be surprised if he didn't have a plan already in place in case this happened. Master Mind asks if Richard can get him some aspirin since the background noise of the city is getting to him. He then asks Black Widow if she needs anything. Something is bothering her. Richard tells here that they can all start with a clean slate so things should be fine. She says that's not the case. Some deals don't have an expiration date.</p><p>Richard continues to wonder what he'll do now. As a reporter, he's been out of the loop for over sixty years. He has no knowledge or contacts. His thoughts are interrupted as a delivery arrives. The Army has brought Electro over in a huge crate. Dynamic Man shows off and easily takes the crate out of the truck. He even makes a point to mention that Richard should be able to find his place even though he doesn't have any real powers.</p><p>Dynamic Man goes out to fight crime. He stops a drive by shooting, saves some people in a fire, stops a convenience store from being robbed, and makes an attempt to stop a man stealing a woman's purse. When he grabs the man he assumed stole the purse, he is told by the woman that he is her husband and they both were trying to stop the thief. Not used to the idea of interracial marriages, Dynamic Man leaves not helping out, saying he has better things to do with his time.</p><p>Back at the estate, Black Widow hears a voice. She says she understands that nothing has changed. She is still the \"instrument of vengeance\" for an unseen entity. It rubs a red...tentacle on her face.</p><p>Richard is now sitting in the living room deep in his thoughts. He says he's a fighter and should be able to find a way to prove Dynamic Man wrong. That he doesn't need super powers to \"make it.\" He hears a noise out in the hall and finds Rockman dragging a mattress down the stairs. He says he's been away from his people for too long and needs to be closer. He says they will be looking for him, <i>she</i> will be looking for him. He takes the mattress down into the basement.</p><p>Later as everyone tries to sleep, Rockman is continuously pounding on the ground.</p>",

So...The Hulk is going after it — and might bring down the Helicarrier instead! The one person standing in the Hulk's path — Iron Man! Also, the return of the LAST person you ever expected to see! Game on!</p><p>On the new S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, Maria Hill shows Tony Stark the kind of gun that was used to kill Emil Blonsky, the Abomination. She-Hulk is there also and wonders why S.H.I.E.L.D. would have such a large gun and how it could have been stolen from them.</p><p>She-Hulk is interrupted as a large red hand tears through the wall and grabs her. Stark wants to know how he got in there and if he's the only one that saw red hands instead of green. There's a lot of noise coming from the other side of the wall so Stark assumes She-Hulk is putting up a good fight. After a big crash, they check it out and find She-Hulk knocked out on the floor.</p><p>Tony orders Maria to get some armor on and to take She-Hulk to sick bay. He calls Agent Quartermain to assess the damage. It seems the Hulk was able to get into the power system. As Iron Man heads towards Quartermain, his scanners pick up more gamma radiation residue on the walls. He finds Clay with Thunderbolt Ross. When he asks where Samson is, it seems he went towards the noise. He doesn't know what happened to him.</p><p>Iron Man continues searching for answers and is about to get some. He comes face to face with the Red Hulk. It growls at him and starts tearing pieces off the helicarrier and is trying to smash him with them. The fact that this Hulk is acting like an animal doesn't make sense that it would use a gun to kill an enemy.</p><p>Going up top, Iron Man finds that the entire helicarrier is about to crash. The Hulk tore out part of the stabilizers and the repairs can't take place for another 15.9 seconds. He activates the \"Iron Man Protocol\" and several automated suits launch.</p><p>She-Hulk is conscious and tells Tony that things are worse than they seem. While the Hulk was there, all of their files on the Hulk have been wiped out and they are about to crash into New York City. Also, it seems that this Hulk spoke to her. It told her that it could kill her any time he wanted. She believed him. Stark gets all the Iron Men to shift the downfall to a field in New Jersey they have reserved for this sort of thing.</p><p>Outside of the Gamma Base in Death Valley, Nevada, Rick Jones gets out of a truck that he hitched a ride in. As the truck drives off, a voice behind him says he thought he was supposed to be dead. Rick just says, \"You thought wrong.\" The voice says it doesn't like being wrong and he should know that by now. A giant red hand smacks him down. It tells him that he's going to have to stay dead. Rick tries getting to his feet and is having trouble thinking clearly. Turning into a <em>BLUE</em> Abomination (and calling himself \"A-Bomb\") he says he has to kill the \"Red Man.\"</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Peter Parker furthers his EWO career with the help of the beautiful Tiffany and his manager, Mr Wendle. Peter also tries to make up with Aunt Msy and Uncle Ben.</em></p><p>At the gym, Crusher Hogan is showing Peter some of his wrestling moves, giving the kid a bit of a scare in the process. Peter asks Crusher if the next move he shows him isn't going to hurt but doesn't get a straight answer. So Peter takes Crusher by surprise by showing him one of his own moves.</p><p>In the office of Monty Caabash, Peter talks about rules he insists they abide by. He wants no one to know his identity so the mask stays on at all times. He wants to be paid in cash. Finally, he's already got a name picked out for himself: Spider-Man. Monty thinks that name will spook the kids so he rattles off some other names but Peter's mind is already made up. The boy wants to be taken seriously so he wants a name that suggests such. Monty settles on his terms and agrees to let him call himself Spider-Man.</p><p>Monty tells Peter that he needs a costume because his current wear makes him look like he's going to rob a corner store. He brings in Tiffany Lebeck, a older woman, who just happens to think Peter is cute, to work on a costume for him. She even offers him a place to stay until he can find his own place (not knowing that he lives with his aunt and uncle) but he declines because he has a test to study for.</p><p>Arriving home late, Peter sneaks in the house, but his efforts to keep his entrance noise-free fail. He hurries to his room, thinking that he should tell off aunt May and uncle Ben for all the times they were never there for him when he was picked on in school. When uncle Ben asks if Peter's awake he just pretends to be sleeping.</p><p>Peter stayed up all night worrying about aunt May and uncle Ben's feelings so he's pretty much dead to the world in science class, not even hearing Liz whispering to him. When class is over, Liz tells Peter that they probably both failed the test. Once again Peter is taken aback by the fact that Liz is talking to him. She notices that Peter is bleeding, but Peter doesn't hear a word she says. He can't even finish what he was going to say to her because he passes out.</p><p>Waking up in a hospital, aunt May and uncle Ben are by Peter's bedside. They say they found out what happened from Liz and they were worried about him. Peter berates them wondering why they weren't worried when he got beat up and picked on. He turns his back to them to get some rest, knowing they'll leave eventually.</p><p>The night of Peter's first pro match and he's all decked out in a new costume (not the familiar red &amp; blue we all know and love, but close). Sensing that Peter is a bit nervous, Tiffany tells him that he'll do wonderful and to show everyone what he can do. Peter wins the match without causing serious injury to his opponent.</p><p>Monty is off having a drink, chatting with some fellows that look like the type your mother would warn you to stay away from. The guy Monty is talking to, Mr. Angel tells him the time has come for him to \"pay off on our investment.\" Sweating up a storm, Monty tells him that Spider-Man will make things nice and even for them. Mr. Angel asks if Spidey is under contract and Monty stutters saying that's he's under contract for life.</p><p>Tiffany talked Spidey into carrying her to the top of the city, something he can't believe he actually did. She tells him he has to push himself in life or else he won't go anywhere. When she begins tugging on his mask, he tells her he isn't ready for her to see his face just yet. She says that she understands but she expects there to be no secrets between them.</p><p>The night of another wrestling match and Monty is freaking out because there's no sign of Spidey. Making a grand entrance in his revamped costume (the classic red &amp; blue), \"the Amazing Spider-Man\" swings into the ring on his newly invented web. Spidey taunts the Mangler with the his trademark witty banter, giving him a few free shots before winning the match.</p><p>Peter patches things up with aunt May and Uncle Ben. He realizes that although they may not understand him, they are good people and he's put them through a lot ever since he got his spider powers. Things seem to be better at school too because he spends the entire lunch period talking with Liz. Life seems to be getting better all the time for Peter.</p>",

The whole place has been blown to pieces.</p> <p>Earrlier, Mathew Rismann didn't shoot Wolfsbane in the head, he just shot her in the knee. Wolfsbane's also been drugged up on heroin. Wolverine is shouting X-23 to stand down, which she does, but as the Purfiers come to tie her up, she pushes a button of a device she's holding, blowing the place to pieces. X-23 pursues Risman and Wolfsbane, and takes down a bunch of Purifiers by shooting them Wolverine helps Warpath out of the rubble, but Risman gets away with Wolfsbane in a helicoptor.</p> <p>Back at Angel's mansion , Wolverine shouts at X-23 for nearly killing Warpath and Wolfsbane. X-23 tells Wolverine that retrieving Wolfsbane wasn't her mission, killing Risman was. Cyclops backs her up, and Angel arrives. Warpath tells them about how Reverand Craig has been thought to join the Purifiers, and how he wasn't just Wolfsbane's guardian, he was her father.</p> <p>Cut to Wolfsbane in a chair, her eyes kept wide open. Reverend Craig comes in and tells her that she's a sin set on earth, and he drugs her again. On the other side of a wall, Risman watches, and Bastion comes to arrives and tells Risman that he's doing everything wrong. He gives him a big lecture about how there is no way to stop the mutant race, but there is actually one chance... Far away a Purifier Submarine relays a message, getting Magus's attention, as he tries to absorb the ship.</p>",

The Ghost Door, though, is only one of Keyhouse's unlikely secrets... the other is the creature who lives in the house's well, a girl who is not a girl... and who would kill to be set free.</i></p><p>The issue opens with a \"WUT I diD THIS SUMMER\" comic by Bode. In it Bode tells of how his father was killed and how his family traveled across the country, and also how he has been turning into a ghost. At the end is a note from Bode's teacher requesting a meeting with Mrs. Locke. Nina discusses with Duncan about Rendell's death and the family. Finally, the topic of the comic is brought up and Duncan recalls how he used to play a game similar to that as a kid. Unknown to them Bode is watching as a ghost, he then thinks about his father. Bode then visits Tyler because Bode thinks about him, and Kinsey because she was thinking of him. Bode decides to tell his siblings about being a ghost, neither believe him. As Bode dredges the Keyhouse pool with his ultimate treasure-finder his mother talks to him about his comic. When she leaves Bode notices an echo from the well house. When he goes in to inspect and asks if it is his echo, the echo answers back that it is. Bode flees and returns with his siblings and again they do not believe him.</p><p>That night Bode dreams of standing with his father, watching a wolf dig up a door with an 11 on it. His father asks him if he wants to hear a knock-knock joke and wakes up when he sees his father’s face.</p><p>Bode decides to visit the echo as a ghost and then in person. The echo explains how it is humanly impossible to climb out of the well and that she can pass through the well house door without fading away. The echo also tells how she knew Bode’s father and about other doors and the Anywhere Key, a key that can open doors to anywhere. Bode then gives the echo a pair of scissors and a hand mirror, in which the echo is reflected as a rotting corpse.</p><p>We then find Sam Lesser in his cell, tattooing himself. The echo then gives him the scissors and mirror and states that they are the keys to his cell.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Sickening violence...just the way you like it. The most screwed-up superhero comic of all time continues in what's sure to be the most exciting launch of 2008. What would happen if you tried to be a super hero? What would happen when an ordinary man in a latex suit comes face-to-face with the criminal underworld? Read about super heroes like you've never seen them before and feel happy that you are living here right now when this book is being published. Your grandchildren will only envy you. Comics just don't get better than this.</em></p><p>Last issue, Dave got his ass kicked and lies in the hospital. Coming to, he worries about what his father must think. Luckily when the ambulance arrived, they found him lying there naked. It seems Dave had the strength to remove his costume despite his broken back and legs.</p><p>They all figure he was mugged. He undergoes several surgeries, metal plates fitted inside his head, months of counseling, and weeks of rehabilitation. He now gets why there aren't real superheroes in the world.</p><p>At home, Dave's dad has set up his room with a dvd player and computer to do his schoolwork. He cries when he realizes the amount of money his dad had to spend over all this. Two months later he is able to go back to school. One night he gets angry and burns all his comics and swears he will never do it again.</p><p>As soon as he gets off his crutches, he's back in costume. Some local girls start accusing him of being a perverted flasher or rapist when they see him walking around in costume. They continue to chastise him as he tries walking away.</p><p>Dave gets knocked down by a man running from something. Some street guys yell at Dave to get out of there since this isn't any of his business and continue to beat the crap out of the guy. Knowing that this is why he is here, he smacks two of the gang dudes in the head with his batons. The third gets it right in the face. Dave yells at the crowd to call the police but they just stand and watch. One of the guys smashes Dave in the back with a garbage can.</p><p>More people arrive. Dave continues to put up a fight and is taking his share of punches too. The crowd just stares in disbelief. Soon they decide to leave figuring he's too crazy and the beating they're getting is not worth it.</p><p>The crowd goes nuts over his heroic act. Dave's teeth are smashed, his ribs are cracked and his eyes are practically swollen shut. The man he saved barely manages to get out a \"Thank you\" to him. During all this, a kid with a cell phone managed to video the whole thing and says it's going straight up on YouTube.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>A new ongoing series spinning out of the decade’s biggest X-Men event! The future of mutantkind continues here!</p><p>There’s only one thing worse than a heavily-armed man with murder on the brain. And that’s several heavily-armed men, none of whom give a damn about Cable’s mission to save mutantkind from total extinction.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cable’s newest enemy—Lucas Bishop—crawls back from bloody oblivion and tracks down his quarry the hard way: one brutal time jump after another. When Bishop finally catches up wit Cable, he’s not going to be in the mood for small talk. It’ll be kill first, ask questions later.</p><p>Cable tries keeping conscious as Bishop stands over him. The baby hasn't been hit but he got shot in the arm. Bishop descends on them with his gun drawn and Cable kicks him back. Bishops new arm sprouts some tentacles that wrap themselves around Cable's neck. Bishop tells him it's over but Cable pulls out his knife and thrusts it into Bishop's side.</p><p>Before things can go further, the local men arrive holding guns at them. They question Bishop's announcement of being a cop since there hasn't been any stupid enough to go there in years. Bishop tells them that this isn't any of their concern and they'll be gone in sixty seconds. Cable decides to use them as a distraction.</p><p>A flashback is shown on how Bishop arrived. After his arm was torn off by Predator X, he woke to find an unconscious but flaming Sunfire lying nearby. Bishop presses his bleeding shoulder up against Sunfire to caughterize his wound. He grabs a gun from a knocked out Scalphunter and tries to shoot Cable as he disappears and hits Xavier instead. After he was knocked away, he made his way back to Forge's place in Texas. Forge has some cybernetics that Bishop is able to attach and uses his time machine technology to search for Nathan. He travels to different times: 2019, 2024, 2037, in search of any sign of Cable and the baby. In 2043, he finds an empty milk can and figures it's too much of a coincidence. Talking to a boatman, Bishop finds out that a month ago, a man and baby traveled across the sea. Bishop uses the tech to find out exactly when Cable arrives at the diner and goes back the day before.</p><p>The men have their weapons trained on Bishop over their dislike of officers. As Bishop pushes them back with his power, Cable tries to weakly make his escape. Hiding and weak, Cable figures he should time-jump out of there. If he does, he won't know how Bishop found them. He doesn't even know if Bishop is working alone. Cable figures he'll time-jump back a day to try to get information. To his shock, he discovers his time mechanism got broke during the fight. Bishop launches a semi towards Cable's hiding spot...</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Written by Mike Costa; Art by Fiona Staples; Cover by Cully Hamner</p><p>There's a man lying dead in his San Francisco house, a mysterious woman with a tragic story, and Jack's powers are on the fritz. When Jack goes looking for answers, things get explosive! </p><p><em>Contains a special sneak preview of Casey Blue.</em></p><p>Still in the house where he found the body of a man apparently named Ben, Jack Hawksmoor is hanging upside down from the roof in a corner where Juliet cannot see him. As she comes more into the house she hangs up her coat and Jack takes a look at the lamp on the table next to her. He can smell that it was made in Shanghai and can see Juliet’s fingerprints on it telling him that she’s turned it on before. He’s fairly certain that Juliet had something to do with the murder so when she goes to turn on the lamp he whispers to it and boosts its output about ten thousand percent and it knocks her out cold.</p><p>When Juliet regains consciousness she’s strapped to a chair hanging off an antennae over the edge of a building several stories off the ground. Jack starts to interrogate her. He finds it strange that he met her earlier that day during a robot attack and now he finds her in the house of a dead man. He asks her to tell him what’s going on. She starts to threaten to break free when she catches his words and asks if he really said “a dead man’s house”. Jack’s eyes glow read and he tells her not to mess around with him. He says he’ll have the concrete swallow her up and then kick her head off like a soccer ball. Juliet’s not hearing any of the threats though, she seems stuck on the idea that Ben is dead. To get her attention Jack lets the antennae lean forward and she drops a little. Juliet isn’t scared by his threats however and says that if he drops her she’ll just get up and have a head start on finding out who killed Ben. Jack decides he believes her and tells the antennae to let her up but instead it snaps and she drops. Jack catches her but only inches away from the ground. After that they take things inside. Jack finds a perch on the wall and it freaks Juliet out so she asks him to sit like a normal person. Jack gets off the wall but he’s becoming impatient. He let her dry herself off and even made her tea but not he wants answers. Juliet says that she and been worked together for years as civil engineers and she had come over that night to talk about the bridge, but she says she doesn’t know anything that could help Jack. He changes the subject and asks about her powers, which seems to unnerve her, but she tells him anyway. Juliet is a grade D powerhouse. She lifts about seven hundred pounds and is exceptionally durable against blunt force damage and can withstand incredible temperatures. She can also jump about fifty feet but she hasn’t practiced in a while. All this comes from being part Kherubim, ninth generation in fact. At eighteen she joined Stormwatch and washed out early on but was put on a watch list so she wouldn’t go out fighting crime on her own. She did it anyway. She went by the name Iron Belle and about a year into her superhero career she got a call from her sister at bank that they were being held up. She went to help and beat the robbers but her sister and three others died in the rescue. After that she hung up her costume and hasn’t used her powers in seven years.</p><p>Jack is climbing on the walls again and he can feel the house’s sympathy for Juliet. He tells her that he knows she didn’t do it but he doesn’t know who did and that doesn’t make sense given his own powers. He tells her basically what he can do, saying that he talks to cities and usually in a situation like this he can just have the TV or a mirror replay what happened or get various clues from other parts of the house, but this murder is different. Something is interfering with that this time and on top of that San Francisco has never really liked him all that much. He asks if there’s anything she can tell him about Ben that might be a clue and all she can do is tell him that he was a civil engineer that worked in a small, boring office and complained about paying for his kid’s college. She says she hardly knew him but Jack notices her clutch at her heart and that tells him that she’s lying. He doesn’t push it though, just tells her to call the police as he leaves the house and takes off into the night to find answers.</p><p>As he moves over and through the city he realizes that things aren’t acting as they should. Antennae don’t move out of the way for him, the spires don’t reach out to him, the power lines don’t even cycle down as he skates across them. San Francisco isn’t giving him much to work with. He makes his way to a train stop in Oakland to see a friend, a man by the name of Sal. Sal is homeless and comes to the Oakland stop so he can beg money and get some sleep, but Jack thinks to himself that he’s never actually seen the old man sleep. As Jack strolls over to the Sal the homeless man says that the city’s mad today. He also says that some kid spat in his cup. Jack offers to find the kid but Sal says he’ll handle it, says he memorized the train by its smell. Jack notices a weird man with a backpack getting on the train but stays and talks with Sal who’s surprised to see Jack in October. Jack lights up a cigarette and says he doesn’t know why he keeps coming back to a city that doesn’t listen to him and never gives him answers. He asks why Sal is always there and the man says that he really has no choice, he’s married to the city, stuck just like Hawksmoor. Jack feels the trains moving and Sal says he and the city are happy to have him back. Just then the train explodes only yards away from them.</p><p>A short time later the fires are put out and Jack is standing over the wreckage. There were 126 causalities but all from the train, no one nearby or in any buildings were hurt as far as he can tell, but he’s still having problems with static keeping him cut off from the city. Jack keeps looking and sees two men on the train tracks and one of them is the guy who with the backpack. They see him and run so he gives chase. As Jack runs he feels the pollution in the air and puts on some more speed but just when he’s catching up the two men leap a superhuman distance off the tracks and onto the roof of a nearby building. Instead of being upset or acting surprised, Jack is happy, he wants to hand out some superhuman punishment tonight. As the men land a huge hand comes up from the building’s roof, grabs one of the men and slams him back down. His friend tries to help him but the first man tells him to go on. He runs and Jack starts to make a second hand when the man holds his hand to his head, looks intently at the hand and it breaks apart. Jack intense pain and realizes that the city isn’t listening to him. It’s ok though, he’s not completely empty-handed. Jack has caught one of the men. He’s about to start with some violent interrogation techniques when the man jumps and attacks him. He’s tougher and faster than Jack assumed he’d be but Jack gets a pipe and starts beating him with it. He asks why the man killed all the people on the train and what he did to Jack’s connection with the city but the man head butts him. Jack choke slams him against the wall and finally gets a response. The man says that he doesn’t know how Jack survived but it’s all over now. Jack is confused and looks down to see the man is carrying another bomb. The building below him is empty but it won’t let him sink it so all he can do is make a run for the edge and hope he makes it over before the bomb goes off. He doesn’t and he gets blown into another building where he interrupts two people in bed in the middle of an affair which he learns about because the man feels guilty and suspects that Jack was sent by his wife. Jack is hurt but takes notice of the man’s comment.</p><p>Soon after, Jack finds himself at Juliet’s door. She asks how he knew where she lived and he tells her that he knows where everyone lives. He asks her why she didn’t tell him she was having an affair with Ben and she looks shocked. She composes herself and says she didn’t know who he was and she was right not to because he’s apparently the kind of man that breaks into people’s homes at night to harass them with questions. She guesses though that that’s not why he came to her this time, that he came because he had nowhere else to go. She sees that he’s hurt but pushes him away saying that she’s not his nurse or his friend. He grabs her and she threatens to put him through a wall but instead they kiss. </p><p>Outside the window someone is watching.</p>",

Can Nightwing, Beast Boy, Raven, Cyborg, Starfire, Red Arrow, and Donna Troy survive long enough to discover the identity of their mysterious foe?</p> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li> <p>Things aren't looking good for former Titan Argent. Not only has a gang of no goodnicks tied her up so her neck is bulging in unnatural ways, but that same gang is ready to feed her to some kind of mutant-shark-monster-demon thing! On the upswing, the demon shark flips on his captors, and before he can move onto an Argent main course, the Titans arrive to save the day. Apparently, they've been on the prowl saving all sorts of former Titans from similar fates, but it's good to know the Justice League is pitching in here and there. </p></li> <li> <p>Back at the base, Beast Boy goes over the incriminating evidence with a Professor X-style floating wheelchair bound Cyborg. While Beasty is trying to remain light about the trauma the team is going through, Cyborg explains he thinks something's fishy about the death of Power Boy. Namely, he never thought the kid was really cut out to be a Titan and is wondering if he had some sinister info or some other such conspiracy thing which he was taken out because of. </p></li> <li> <p>Raven in the meantime is meditating her way to daddy dearest's realm by way of astral projection. Once there she finds a barren wasteland and an aging, ravished Trigon. But even in his weakened state (the result of fending off other-worldly raiders after he mucked around on earth so long), he still has it in him to muck around on Earth a lot, especially when it comes to defeating all those who formerly defeated him: The Titans! </p></li> <li> <p>When Raven tries to escape her father's realm unharmed, it causes some ground-shaking havoc back at HQ. Several members of the team (including Raven's former boyfriend-ish person Wally West) try to jump in and save her, but in the end only a well-placed bomb arrow from Roy can shake Raven loose. And while she ain't too happy about how Red Arrow went about freeing her, Raven's even more worried about the fact that Trigon isn't working alone on earth. In fact, most of the trouble's being caused by some heretofore unseen siblings of Raven—or as the solicitation text for next issue likes to call them: The Sons of Trigon!!!</p></li></ul>",

            "description": "<p>The stories of post-disbanding X-Men members continue in the second and last part of this mini-series:  <br /></p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>\"<u>Lights Out</u>\" - Beast goes to the ruins of the Xavier institute for the last time. He cleans the place, gets rid of detailed documents about every student who ever set foot on the mansion's grounds and sends important files (like the anti-viral to the Legacy virus) to safe places. After collecting remains of Sentinels and packing No-Girl for the ride, Hank makes a final jump over the ruins and leaves the place, perhaps for the last time.</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><p>\"<u>Planting Seeds</u>\" - Old memories lead Illyana Rasputin to her current state: A demon-like creature in Limbo. She refuses to become evil as Belasco – the demon who trapped her in Limbo – wants, even if it'll give her old life back; she won't let anyone else suffer like she did. Illyana realizes that the first step is to regain her heart and she heads to Xavier's mansion to find her brother and friends. The sight of the ruined institute makes her sadder and now she thinks that she can't return home by love only by suffering; but she won't do it alone and everyone who ever hurt her will pay.</p> </li> <li><p>\"<u>The Hole</u>\" - Havok sits in a cell deep in space. His greatest torment is to hear Polaris' screams of pain as she's being tortured by his brother Vulcan's followers. Vulcan shows his face to tell Alex about the fall of the X-Men, death of Xavier – all because of a mutant baby. Despite Vulcan's desire to break his spirit, the news of a newborn mutant actually makes Havok stronger, filled with hope and willing to defeat his brother when the time will come.</p> </li> <li><p>\"<u>Idée Fixe</u>\" - Forge wakes up in a hospital after the attack by Bishop and the disbanding of the X-Men. He channels his thoughts to one direction: the components of time travel Cable brought from the future. Forge goes back to his ruined lab, but being attacked by Bishop. This time he fights back, but looses anyway. When he regains conscious, the components are gone along with a bionic arm. Forge clings on his thoughts and ideas, sketches them before they will be lost forever. He locks himself in the lab and continues on working on his many ideas, hopefully with no other interruptions. </p></li> <li><p>\"<u>The Sun Also Sets</u>\" - Dani Moonstar sits in her secluded cabin in the woods of Colorado. Surge breaks in, mumbles and faints. When she wakes up, Surge says that she failed her friends as a team leader and can't live with that burden. Later Dani takes her for a walk outside. Dani says that she can't do a thing and there are always sacrifices; it only makes Surge furious. Dani says that the only way to deal with pain is to use it, if you can't fight it – embrace it. Despite Dani's appreciated help, eventually Surge is not convinced.</p> </li> </ul><p>Hank bids farewell to the mansion with a final act of acrobatics.</p><p>Illyana current looks are not of the cute little sister of Colossus, but she is still blonde and that's all that matters, right?</p><p>For years Scott and Alex couldn't get along but eventually they did, so it seems that even this moment between Alex and his brother Gabriel is a step in the right direction. Or not.</p><p>Although the saying is \"Third time's the charm\", it's really painful to watch Forge gets his ass handed to him by Bishop for the third time in the last 5 months.</p><p>Finally, Surge found who is to blame for what happened to Mutantkind – nature – and showed no mercy. How come no one thought about it before?!</p>",

Fortunately, it seems that Toby has an ally—the Incredible Hulk! Can even the Hulk survive the most titanic throw-down with Juggernaut in comic book history? Find out in this epic clash of super hero action…and ponder—who is Clyde Wyncham? <br /><br /><br />Toby finds himself face-to-face with the Hulk in the woods.  To his surprise, the Hulk speaks to him.  He tells Toby that he's looking for the Juggernaut.  They were in Arizona and then suddenly they were pulled there.  Hulk tells Toby he doesn't have to be afraid.  He just wants to find the Juggernaut before he hurts anyone.<br /><br />Juggernaut appears and they begin fighting.  Toby is still in shock.  Juggernaut tells Hulk that nothing is going to stop him from doing what he has to do there.  Toby has seen enough and takes off.<br /><br />At the hospital, Toby's father is visiting his old friend, Clyde.  He tells him that he allowed the comic store guys to sell the comics that were in his old house.  He just wants them to go to a good home and be enjoyed.  A nurse walks up and informs him that visiting hours are over.  She asks if he's family or a friend.  Toby's dad tells her that Clyde doesn't have any family since his mom died.  They've known each other since grade school.<br /><br />Toby is waiting for his dad outside.  Apparently he's told Toby that he's only visited Clyde three times in twenty years but wouldn't say why that was.  Toby is still shaken up and tells his dad what he saw.  Toby takes him to the woods where the trees have been knocked over and uprooted.  His dad claims he doesn't believe him.  He then tells Toby not to talk about it.  He tells him to trust him that people don't want to hear about it.  As they head away from the woods (and Clyde's old house), three shadows can be seen on the rooftop.  The shadows appear to be Dr. Doom, Electro and the Green Goblin.<br /><br />Toby's dad covers for him with his mom.  After school the next day, Toby stops by the comic store.  They are still thrilled about being able to sell the old comics.  They gratiously offer Toby a 10% discount on anything he buys that day.  At dinner, Toby finds out that Hart, his mom's new guy is thinking about taking a job in England.  He gets up and say they are not moving, he's not family, all his mom cares about is his money.  He runs to his room in tears.  Toby knows that his mom doesn't want him to turn out like his dad, smart but lazy.  He seemed to have no real skills but apparently this was before everyone found out what he was capable of...<br /><br />Outside, Stilt-Man takes a stroll.  A couple blocks away, a dude named Edgar is working on making pirate copies of Commodore 64 games to sell.  His wife answers a knock at the door.  It's the Sandman.  He forces his way in.  Edgar takes off only to be stopped by Electro.</p>",

            "description": "<p>(Tarnax VII, many months ago) <br/> On this alien Skrull world, within a city of spires with spacecraft of varying sizes and shapes floating overhead, a teacher stands before his attentive class. He informs his pupils that the time is coming. Their people are scattered and their homeworld shattered. The end is near, it would seem. All their empire has known is conflict. This is their way now. But, he adds, there is another way. There has come a savior... one who will unite their people and bring peace to the empire.<br/><br/> </p><p>Listening carefully to his teacher is a young Xavin. Chrell wanders over to him and informs him that training calls. Xavin gets up and departs with Chrell. As they wander through the grounds, Xavin asks if he knows of the prophecies; of the uniter. Of course, replies Chrell. All children learn such fairy tales. He suspects that tomorrow, his shaman will tell him of the Dire Wraiths. \"You mock him,\" states Xavin, surprised. Chrell replies that he has seen many things in his time, but no half-breed can bring peace to the Skrull Empire. Only death can do that. Xavin asks if he believes in <em>anything</em>. Chrell tell him that he believes that <em>he</em> is important to the empire, but he has much to learn. Rather than concern himself with his beliefs, he should concentrate on his training. No matter what prophecy he believes in, he has to be <em>alive</em> to see it come true.</p> <p>(Earth, now) <br/> Xavin is being punched in the face by a Super Skrull with bear's hands. Two other Skrulls stand over them. Xavin falls backwards against the unconscious Hulkling, groaning in pain. The Skrulls speak to her in their own language, and she replies that she isn't a traitor. They have to listen. They don't appear too interested in doing that. Before they can punish Xavin further, Wiccan teleports in with Speed alongside him. \"Get away from him,\" yells Billy. Tommy immediately uses his super speed to take out two of the Skrulls with his punches, and jokes that Billy's call wasn't exactly 'Avengers Assemble.' He comments on the bear arms, and reckons they're running out of ideas. Wiccan uses a spell to toss Xavin's assailant against a wall, but he is caught from behind by one of the other Skrulls exhibiting Human Torch powers. The Skrull leaps towards Billy and Tommy and grabs them both by the throat. As he says something in Skrullian, his face is smashed into the wall between them by Xavin, using his right arm like the Thing.</p> <p>\"What just happened\" exclaims Tommy. Billy pauses a moment before telling him that it's Xavin. She asks him to get up. They have to get Dorrek to safety. Billy rushes over to teddy who is lying in the water, and Tommy asks him how they can tell it's Xavin. Does he have a mole or something he's missing. Xavin says she doesn't have time for this. He'll have a second team in place. Billy asks who she means. Why is this happening? They left Eli, Kate and Vision up there. They have to... Xavin interjects forcefully. \"We have to get Dorrek to safety! That's all that matters,\" she yells, her fist clenched. \"Oh, right. It is you. I can tell now from the stick up your... hey,\" says Tommy, \"Where's your team. Where are the runaways?\"</p> <p>(meanwhile, New York City, invasion   13 minutes) <br/> The Leapfrog is confronted by two Skrulls, and one of them crashes through the windscreen and into the cockpit, startling Nico and Victor. The Leapfrog begins to descend as Victor unleashes an electric bolt at their assailant. Vic tries to get Karolina and Chase to wake up. One of the Skrull's speaks to them but they have no idea what he is saying. It appears to be an exclamation of surprise, as Old Lace leaps from the back of the 'frog and grabs him in her large teeth. The Leapfrog descends with alarming speed, and Nico asks Vic to do something. \"Like what?\" he asks, \"Use a spell?\" The 'frog hits the ground with a crunch, with the Skrull in hot pursuit. He lands and yanks Victor from the wreckage. Vic asks Nico to cast a spell... quickly, but the Skrull stands on Nico's arm. Something snaps and Nico screams. As the Skrull's eyes light up, he is hit hard from behind by a powerful burst of flame. It's Chase, and he's getting some use out of his new gauntlets. He tells the 'little green man' to get up. They haven’t even started yet.</p> <p>The Skrull turns and sees Chase standing next to Molly. He says something in Skrullian, but Chase doesn't need to understand. \"Not scared of me? That's okay,\" he grins. \"I'm not the one you should be scared of. Sic 'im Mol.\" Molly rushes towards the Skrull and smashes him so hard that he is flying through a skyscraper and heading skywards in seconds. Chase helps Victor to his feet, and Vic jokes that he was just about to unleash on him. Molly helps Nico, and she asks if she is okay. Her wrist looks extra bendy. Nico tells her it's fine. She wants everyone back into the Leapfrog. They're going. Chase looks at Old Lace and asks what that is on her mouth. He then realizes it's Skrull blood, and nervously cuts his question short. Molly hands Nico her Staff of One back and asks where they are going. There's a billion space invaders over there. Shouldn't they go beat them up? Chase asks what the hell happened. Before Nico can respond, Karolina appears with Klara and asks where Xavin is.</p> <p>(Times Square) <br/> Several Skrull ships hover over central Manhattan. On board one of these is Commander Chrell. X'iv informs him that there is no response from the strike team. Chrell replies that the target was down. Someone is protecting him. Maybe it's the magician, but he doesn't think so. This was something else. It looks like X'iv will be needed after all. She asks what her orders are. Chrell tells her to kill Dorrek and kill his protectors. She can also kill every Skrull who sees him. \"I am his servant,\" replies X'iv, before teleporting away.</p> <p>Down in the tunnels, Teddy wakes up a little confused. He asks what's going on. Billy tells him it's okay. Teddy asks how he found him. Billy replies that he'll always find him. They're under the city, and Xavin's helping them. Teddy asks where the others are. They have to get back to the fight. Billy asks him to calm down. They were going to kill him. He used a spell to get to him. He promises that he'll explain. Xavin then appears and tells them that <em>she</em> will explain. She informs them that what is going on, is that there is a full invasion of Earth by Skrull extremists. They believe that their God has promised Earth to them, and now they've come for it. It's something Teddy could have <em>prevented</em>. Teddy is surprised by the accusation. Xavin explains that if he had just accepted his responsibilities, he could have united their empire and spared the Earth from what's happening. It didn't have to come to this.</p> <p>Teddy responds by telling Xavin that she can't put this on <em>him</em>. He never asked for this. Xavin barks back, asking how he could be so selfish. He was supposed to show their people a better way. \"<strong>This isn't my fault</strong>!\" shouts Teddy back at her. Billy tries to get them both to calm down, but Xavin is furious. She says that perhaps this will calm him down. She informs Teddy that the single deadliest Skrull in the empire is on Earth and he's coming for Dorrek, despite the fact that Dorrek has turned his back on his destiny like a spiteful child. His presence could put a stop to all of this. So, the extremists have marked him for death. Billy is shocked that his partner is being targeted in this way. Teddy asks how he could have stopped this. He tried and they <em>attacked</em> him. \"<em>Try harder</em>!\" exclaims Xavin. This is their home. It's his beloved's home and now it is hers. She will die to save it. Will he?</p> <p>All of a sudden, Speed appears and warns them that they're in trouble. They become invisible, probably Wiccan's doing, and X'iv teleports in. Somehow she can see them, despite being invisible. Dressed like Elektra, she pulls out a sai from underneath her cloak and hurls it instantly towards Teddy. Just before it strikes his chest, Teddy uses his speed to catch the blade in his fingers before rushing towards her. Xavin tells the others to attack her. She will not hesitate to kill them. Wiccan tries to send her back to where she came from with a spell, but X'iv avoids the blast and smacks him in the face. She then takes down Speed by clothes-lining him as he sprints towards Wiccan. Hulkling wants to join in, but Xavin keeps him away, telling him that he's too important. Teddy doesn't want to leave without his friends. X'iv listens to Xavin's heartbeat and recognizes her as Prince Xavin. Xavin creates a tubular forcefield and slams it into X'iv, before creating small discs from the same material upon which each of them sit. She takes them along the tunnel, though Speed reckons it's too slow for his liking. Left behind in the dark tunnels, X'iv contacts Commander Chrell. She informs him that they have a situation. Two of the target's teammates are present, but there's someone else. She doesn't know how it is possible, but she recognized Prince Xavin's heartbeat. Chrell is all too familiar with Xavin. X'iv asks what her orders are now that she's lost them. Chrell doesn't reply to her, but tells his crew that he needs a city-wide scan for an alien bioenergy signature.</p> <p>(elsewhere) <br/> \"You did <strong>what</strong>?!\" screams Karolina. She asks Nico how she could just leave Xavin like that. Nico tries to get her to listen. This is what Xavin wanted. Karolina asks since when did she care what any of them want. Vic tells Nico that she doesn't understand. It’s bad. There's an army of those things, all with multiple powers. Molly asks why, now that they're all awake, they can't go back and help. Xavin's one of them. They can't just leave her. Nico says no. They are all her responsibility and they're leaving. Xavin's a soldier. They aren't. This isn't them. Chase asks what's the matter with them. They're going back right now. Little Klara interrupts them and points at a television screen in a shop window. On screen are images of the remaining Young Avengers in Times Square. Vic realizes that they are live pictures. They see a Skull attacking Hawkeye, Patriot and Vision. Karolina's eyes widen as she recognizes their friends. \"They're in trouble,\" exclaims Molly. Chase covers up Molly and Klara's eyes. They watch helplessly as the Skrull blasts Vision right through the head. Nico covers her mouth. She tells Karolina that Xavin saved their lives. If they had stayed that would have been them. A white flash behind them sees the arrival of Chrell, X'iv and three more Super Skrulls. \"It still can be, children,\" says Chrell. \"But before you die, you're going to help me kill two princes.\"</p><p><br/></p>",

As Conan recovers from last issue's clash with raiders on the Cimmerian borderlands, a kind stranger shelters him and weaves a tale of Conan's grandfather, Connacht.

Exiled by a group of Marvel 'heroes' to the savage alien planet of Sakaar, the Hulk raged, bled and conquered - rising from slave to gladiator to king. Now, the Hulk returns to Earth to wreak his terrible vengeance on Iron Man, Reed Richards, Dr. Strange and Black Bolt - and anyone else who gets in the way. Stronger than ever, accompanied by his monstrous Warbound gladiator allies and possessed by the fiercest and purest rage imaginable, the Hulk may just tear this stupid planet in half. The epic story of anger unbound begins in WORLD WAR HULK #1! And in WORLD WAR HULK: FRONTLINE #1, get your street-level view of the Hulk's invasion! The Green Goliath has returned to Earth on a collision course with some of Marvel's mightiest heroes...so what does that mean for the ordinary people caught in the crossfire? Ben Urich and Sally Floyd pound the pavement to uncover the story behind the story! Plus: Who wants our tireless reporters to take down J. Jonah Jameson, and how do they want them to do it?</i></p>",

            "description": "<p>(continuing from the previous issue)</p><p>As the smoke clears, the Majesdanians barge into their home. Xavin begins to fight the Majesdanians all on her own, but Nico calls \"Scatter!\", causing the all the Majesdanians to disappear.</p><p>All, except for one - vaDanti. Before vaDanti runs away, Victor metallically controls the kitchen knives to make them fly towards vaDanti, leaving them hovering an inch away from him. After wrapping him up in metal bars, the Runaways hold him captive. Chase, Victor and Molly are angry. Xavin helps Karolina recover from the shock, recognizing them as Majesdanians. Klara assumes they may be outlaws, but Victor interrupts Nico and asks where she sent the other Majesdanians. Blushing, Nico says, \"Well\"...</p><p>(elsewhere)</p><p>As it turns out, vaRikk ended up in the African plains. Infuriated, he is promptly attacked by a male African lion. deHalle, meanwhile, lands in the frozen plains of Antarctica. The General vaDrann, furious, finds himself on the Great Wall of China.</p><p>(back in Los Angeles)</p><p>Xavin re-shape-shifts into the form of a young male (she did this in the previous issue) and shoos aways the neighbours, who had heard the violent explosions. Shape-shifting back into her female form, she returns inside to find the Runaways have circled around a tied-up vaDanti, and are questioning him and his motives. As vaDanti isn't being cooperative, the Runaways begin to pressure answers out of him - Chase angrily gets up and throws away his chair, telling vaDanti that he argues like a girl. vaDanti finally snaps, and with rage he explains how the Dean family is the reason Majesdane is destroyed, and how the blood of billions is on Karolina Dean's head.</p><p>Finally, losing patience, Nico explains she is a witch, and orders vaDanti to explain himself before the other Majesdanians get back, because the Runaways have seen their best shot; Nico threatens vaDanti that he wouldn't like the Runaways when they were mad. Not even a little. Sure enough, the seven Runaways stand together - intimidating vaDanti, who tells his version of the story about how Majesdane was destroyed.</p><p>The Runaways are emotional by the end of the story. A crying Karolina tells vaDanti that her parents were monsters, and she isn't them. That's why she thought her marriage to a Skrull would help stop the war. vaDanti doesn't care; as her father caused it, so she is equally in trouble; it was her father who made it possible for the Skrulls to find Majesdane. His action that led the invasion of Majesdane. His action that led to the destruction.</p><p>Chase accidentally lets slip that Xavin is a Skrull - this infuriates vaDanti's anger, but Xavin explains that she is no more her father than Karolina is hers. Xavin doesn't agree with the aggression of her people; she did not attack Majesdane, she didn't invade Earth. Xavin says that on Earth, she learnt another way. She learnt to love. vaDanti, however, says he thinks it's perverted. Karolina, shocked and angry, slaps vaDanti across the face with all her might, causing vaDanti to bleed heavily. Karolina, crying, states that she is not her father. She is proud to be a Majesdane, and would never betray their own people. She says Majesdane doesn't want justice, they want a scapegoat; the one responsible for the destruction of Majesdane is dead (Frank Dean). There's nothing anyone can do about it now. As Karolina leaves the room, she ends off saying if vaDanti wants to find a pervert in the room, he should look for the one with a heart full of hate (himself).</p><p>(later)</p><p>Karolina is outside, on the beach. She is standing in the shallow water, letting the water ripple gently across her feet. As she looks into the setting sun, her mind lost in thought, she hears splashed footsteps behind her, but doesn't look around. Nico arrives by her side. For a moment, the two of them stare into the sun, until Nico sighs and looks at her friend. After a pause, she tells Karolina that they all love her. Karolina doesn't say anything, but rests her head on Nico's shoulder. Nico comforts her friend.</p><p>(in China)</p><p>The General (using a signal from the device that was attached to his wrist) signals the Majesdanian spaceship they had arrived in, which arrives above him. He contacts deHalle in Antarctica and vaRikk in Africa and tells them he will pick them up soon.</p><p>(in Los Angeles)</p><p>With Molly and Klara's opinion, Nico uses magic to repair the kitchen. Chase, in the magically repaired living room, informs them that the pizza has turned up. Klara tries pizza for the first time. Xavin, however, grabs a slice and takes it outside, to where it's dark. She arrives on the porch where Karolina is looking out into the dark ocean. Xavin asks Karolina if she'd like to come inside because they have pizza. Silently, Karolina states that she isn't hungry. Xavin gives her a look and puts the pizza and coke beside Karolina, and also looks out into the ocean. For a couple of seconds, the two are silent as the breeze washes over them. Xavin silently says that something has changed, and Karolina agrees. Xavin finally asks \"Are we okay?\" to which a crying Karolina miserably replies that she doesn't know.</p><p>(elsewhere, at a hospital)</p><p>Val Rhymin looks down onto the hospital bed where Bob, the station manager lies. Bob is unconscious, and the only sound heard is the steady \"Beep. Beep. Beep,\" of the monitor showing Bob's heartbeat. Val finally speaks to the sleeping Bob, revealing that the doctor said he would be fine. Surviving a heart attack and a 20-story fall? Val says Bob's a tough one, and he'll give him that. Val tells Bob that all he had many years spent trying to by somebody and to make something of himself, but Bob is always standing in the way dumping gloom and reality on his dream. Finally, Val tells Bob that life would be so much better if he wasn't here.</p><p>Later, Val leaves Bob's hospital room, but not before hearing the satisfiying \"Beep. Beep. Beep,\" of the monitor turning into one long \"Beeeeeeep,\" signalling the end of Bob's life.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>Val Rhymin's boss, Bob makes his second and last appearance after Val kills him. The Runaways' neighbours make their second, more notable appearance.</p><p>For the first time ever, Xavin shape-shifts into the form of a female Skrull after she loses her temper.</p>",

When Harvey Dents psyche changed into Two-Face he had all of these choices between right and wrong but he chose the wrong one.

His parables of suspense and wrenching psychological tension will leave you curled up and screaming for more - whether you like it or not!</i></p><p><i>Collecting TALES TO ASTONISH #11-20</i></p>",

Writer Jean-Francois Di Giorgio and artist Frédéric Genêt tap into the rich mythology of the noble Samurai, creating a nuanced look at the fabled Japanese warriors in a captivating story filled with emotion and elegant artwork! On the borders of Japan, a terrible plot is being prepared: General Akuma seems bent on betraying the Emperor despite a mysterious secret that binds them. Meanwhile, Takeo the Samurai continues his quest to obtain the treasure from the XIIIth prophet's vault and foil Akuma's destructive plans. But there are many obstacles in his way: Akanobu — the mountain of the seven sources, whose rare visitors are never seen again — and the terrifying Shadow Sisters. Fear sets in. And it would be easier if Natsumi wasn't by their side — Natsumi, on whose shoulders could lay the destiny of the kingdom.</i></p>",

But when the truth about the Weapon X Program finally begins to surface, the repressed emotions tied to those memories may be too much for Logan to handle! It's not just a history lesson... it's a lesson in pain!</em></p><p><em>PLUS: A warped tour of the Weapon X facility, as seen through the eyes of everyone's favorite Merc-with-a-Mouth -- DEADPOOL!</em></p><p><u>Note</u>: This issue includes a preview of <a data-ref-id=\"4000-143687\" href=\"/wolverine-first-class-koan/4000-143687/\">Wolverine: First Class #9</a>.</p><h3>Synopsis</h3><h4>Part 2, Bad to the Bone</h4><p>Professor Xavier and Wolverine witness the adamantium bonding process. They hear the experimenters comment on the pain and need to continue. The memory brings Wolverine back into the present and he lashes out. Xavier wants to stop probing Wolverine's mind for the time being, but Wolverine wants to keep going. Xavier is reluctant, but they return to the Astral Plane to further delve into Woverine's forgotten memories.</p><p>Xavier had left a temporal anchor in Wolverine's mind and the two of them land in the room in which the bonding process is happening. Wolverine doesn't fully understand what is happening, only that he knows those doing the experiments \"did this\" to him. Xavier asks what they did and Wolverine has to admit that he doesn't know. Xavier suggests they listen in on the doctors. Doing so, the two men learn that adamantium is being bonded to Wolverine. The process complete, the memory Wolverine is approached so as to place him in a recovery cell. We awakens and attacks his captors. Pausing, he turns to look at Xavier and Wolverine. Then he attacks. The memory throws Wolverine into the tank and the adamantium pumping tubes immediately latch onto Wolverine's body. Wolverine then experiences the pain he felt when he was actually present for the bonding. He realizes that he's never felt that much pain before... at least that he can remember. The rest of the memory plays out as if nothing has happened: the doctors subdue the memory Wolverine and move him to a cell. Wolverine then recalls a female doctor showing a form of compassion by taking him some food. He and Xavier then move on to another dark memory.</p><p>The memory Wolverine is encircled by troopers. Xavier and Wolverine listen in as a training exercise commences. They hear the doctors commenting on the amazing feats of the memory Wolverine as he busts up every trooper that gets in his way. It seems that these doctors have trained the memory/old Wolverine to wipe his mind clean of all remembrances. He's nothing but a raw killer now. Xavier suggests that it is time to leave. Wolverine gets violent and pushes Xavier around, then sees his memory self and apologizes. The two men leave as the memory is shown to still have a shred of humanity left and as he is drugged and dragged away. The story concludes in the next issue.</p><h4>No Class</h4><p>Deadpool takes the reader on a tour of the Weapon X facility. He wavers in and out of crazy talk and gibberish before finally meeting himself before he becomes Deadpool.</p>",

Massive climatic disturbances are wreaking havoc with the planet — underwater volcanic eruptions, tidal waves crashing over whole cities and snowstorms burying entire countries—and even the assemblage of the Ultimate U’s mightiest is no match for this worldwide destruction! Featuring Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, the Ultimates, the Hulk and more, find out whose lives are at stake in this defining moment of truth for the Ultimate Universe. Brought to you by award-winning scribe Jeph Loeb and superstar artist David Finch, this is the must-have book that will set the stage in the Ultimate U for years to come. If you want to get in on the most astounding changes taking place in all of comics, this is the place to be. You have been told!</i></p><p>Spider-Man is in the city looking for survivors. Spotting the numerous Giant Men, he asks for help only to get some from Hulk. Iron Man brings in the body of Captain America to the Triskelion demanding they treat him. Talking to Carol, he hands her Cap's shield and tells her to give it to him if he wakes up.</p><p>At Stark's mansion, Clint tries getting Hank's attention (who is in giant form searching for Janet). He finally gets his attention saying he wants to help since he knows what it's like to lose the woman you love. He also tells him that he has enhanced vision so he could probably have a better chance at finding her.</p><p>At the Baxter Building, Ben sits with an unconscious Sue, whose powers are acting up against Ben. Reed has Namor pinned to his craft until they are brought aboard another craft. Dr. Doom is there along with the Squadron Supreme's Princess Power. Doom tells Reed that it was Magneto that offset the magnetic poles and caused the tidal wave in New York and ice storm in Latveria. He tells Reed that they need to get Nick Fury.</p><p>Over New York, Thor is in search of Valkyrie. Finding her body, he travels to Valhalla to have words with Hela. She tells him that if he can defeat her army of fallen warriors, he'll be rewarded for a price. Thor begins his slaughter and finds himself aided by Captain America, who isn't quite sure why he's there but says they'll figure it out later.</p><p>Clint thinks he sees something and tells Hank to stay back. He finds the Blog feasting upon Janet's intestines.</p><p>At Xavier's Academy, Magneto is there to talk to Charles. Xavier says their talk was never this extreme. He tells him his act of revenge for the deaths of Wanda and Pietro won't even the scales. Magneto says he will wash away all of man's destruction in three days. Xavier says he will be hunted down and only remembered as a madman. Knowing this moment would come eventually, Magneto grabs Charles from behinds and seemingly snaps his neck.</p>",

This collector's edition of the cult classic contains bonus features: New color cover art from manga-ka Masayuki Taguchi; Unpublished character sketches from manga-ka Masayuki Taguchi; Weapons details by Eliot R. Brown (Punisher's Armory); \"Second Opinion\" insights on characters' injuries from E.R. physician Michael Dallos, M.D.</i></p><p>Class B's island death match continues unabated, and the middle school students have already been winnowed down to about a third of their original number. Tensions ratchet upward as the survivors' true colors begin to emerge. Sugimura finds his childhood friend Takako and learns something terrible about the behavior of Mitsuko “Hardcore” Souma. And when Noriko comes down with a fever, Shuuya and Shogo are forced seek medical attention for her. But their respite is painfully short-lived when the abandoned clinic they have been sheltering in becomes a danger zone. What danger—or which classmate—is lurking outside with a machine gun? Meanwhile, Mimura and Yutaka have begun to initiate a Program of their own…one that involves building a bomb. Which, if successful, could have an explosive impact upon the outcome of this horrific battle royale.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 25: Honor</li><li>Chapter 26: Bond</li><li>Chapter 27: Respect and Affection</li><li>Chapter 28: Insanity</li><li>Chapter 29: The Right Answer</li><li>Chapter 30: Persuasion</li><li>Chapter 31: Everybody's Thoughts</li><li>Chapter 32: Secret Weapon</li><li>Chapter 33: Rouse</li><li>Chapter 34: Last Man Standing</li><li>Chapter 35: Trap</li><li>Chapter 36: Thirst</li><li>Chapter 37: Existence</li><li>Chapter 38: Set Up</li><li>Chapter 39: Anxiety</li><li>Side Story: Man of Justice</li><li>Chapter 40: Sworn Friend</li><li>Chapter 41: Flower of Courage</li><li>Chapter 42: Parting</li><li>Chapter 43: Raid</li><li>Chapter 44: Hard Charge</li><li>Chapter 45: Rescue</li><li>Chapter 46: Encounter</li><li>Chapter 47: Departure</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>Sachiko and Masato Azuma have overcome numerous obstacles in dealing with their firstborn son Hikaru’s autism. Having saved their marriage from ending in ruins, the young couple has welcomed a healthy baby girl, Kanon, into their tight-knit family. But with the obvious differences between Hikaru’s and Kanon’s developmental abilities, it becomes apparent that social prejudices against Hikaru’s disability are never far away. As Hikaru moves into fourth grade, Sachiko encounters a new student, Miyu, whose mother has completely given up on her daughter’s life and her own. With the help of Hikaru’s beloved teacher, Aoki-sensei, Sachiko aims to bring hope back to Miyu’s family. But when Aoki-sensei transfers to a different school and Hikaru’s special education class is thrown into upheaval by yet another tragedy, can Sachiko continue to hold on to her own hope for her son’s future?</i></p><p>Collects and translates volumes 3 &amp; 4 of Hikari To Tomoni.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Later Elementary Years</h4><ul><li>Episode 1</li><li>Episode 2</li><li>Episode 3</li><li>Episode 4</li><li>Episode 5</li><li>Episode 6</li><li>Episode 7</li><li>Episode 8</li><li>Episode 9</li><li>Episode 10</li><li>Episode 11</li><li>Episode 12</li></ul><h4>Living in My Town, Being Myself... and That's How I (Tetsuyuki Akashi) Became A Public Employee by Tetsuyuki Akashi's Mother, Yoko Akashi</h4><h4>About the \"Convention On the Rights of Children\"</h4><h4>Guided By The Children by Kiyokazu Nagae, Special Education Teacher</h4>",

When the shōgunate was overthrown, Aoshi and his men were deprived of both home and purpose. All that's left to them now are their fighting skills, which they've put to service as a mercenary guard for the industrialist Takeda Kanryū. However much sympathy Kenshin might feel for the Oniwanbanshū, he's sworn to stop Kanryū's corrupt plans. But in order to do so, he'll have to defeat Aoshi, a shinobi prodigy and master of a deadly twin-sword style.</i></p><p><i>Later, Isurugi Raijūta, a swordsman of incredible strength and ferocity, requests Kenshin's aid in reforming Japan's swordsmanship schools, to save them from their decline in the modern age. Although Kenshin is intrigued by Raijūta's ideals, he's disturbed by his increasingly brutal methods. Sanosuke runs into some trouble of his own when he's reunited with a member of the Sekihō Army--the doomed civilian-run unit that they both served in during the revolution--who's determined to exact revenge from the Meiji government.</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Volume 4: Dual Conclusions</h4><ul><li>Act 23: The Martial-Artist and the Spy</li><li>Act 24: Savage Han'nya, Honorable Shikijō</li><li>Act 25: Duel of the Masters</li><li>Act 26: Shinomori Aoshi, Okashira</li><li>Act 27: Battle's Heat</li><li>Act 28: Battle's End</li><li>Act 29: Dual Conclusions: Megumi</li><li>Act 30: Dual Conclusions: Aoshi</li></ul><h4>Volume 5: The State of Meiji Swordsmanship</h4><ul><li>Act 31: Bonus Story: Yahiko's Battle (1)</li><li>Act 32: Bonus Story: Yahiko's Battle (2)</li><li>Act 33: Bonus Story: Yahiko's Battle (3)</li><li>Act 34: The State of Meiji Swordsmanship</li><li>Act 35: \"That Man\" • Raijūta</li><li>Act 36: Secret Sword</li><li>Act 37: Meeting at Tsukayama Garden</li><li>Act 38: Yutarō's Skill</li><li>Act 39: Clash</li></ul><h4>Chapter 6: No Worries</h4><ul><li>Act 40: The Ideal Man</li><li>Act 41: The Second Secret Sword</li><li>Act 42: You've No Idea</li><li>Act 43: Settling the Score</li><li>Act 44: No Worries</li><li>Act 45: Extra: Sanosuke &amp; Nishiki Paintings (1)</li><li>Act 46: Extra: Sanosuke &amp; Nishiki Paintings (2)</li><li>Act 47: Extra: Sanosuke &amp; Nishiki Paintings (3)</li></ul>",

In IDW's second issue, our intrepid hero (assisted by Scamper, the immortal rabbit), continues his quest to become the first Igor to enter the Evil Science Fair. Presented for the first time anywhere, see the origin of Brain, who is... well, a brain in a jar. On wheels. With a mechanical arm. But unfortunately, not much smarts.</em></p>",

C.F. comes out of the mythic Providence, Rhode Island art and noise scene–his musical alias is Kites. In a recent profile The Comics Reporter observes, \"Contrasting sharply with many of his flashier contemporaries, C.F.'s primary skill lies in overlooked nuances of comics storytelling, in particular pacing.\" His distinctive voice and intricate rendering skills have attracted attention from the groundbreaking comics anthology, Kramers Ergot–he was included in the fourth issue, and featured on the cover of the fifth. Here, C.F.'s epic fantasy–an allegorical tale where power, physical identity and even gender are always in flux–picks up steam: Buell Kazee sneaks down into the cellar of the plex knowe crypt and conjures trouble; Tetradyne Cola takes a nap and dreams of Monica Glass and the lemon sparklers of star studio; members of the Marker clan compare notes on their magical crimes and the witches of Lace Temblor conspire over transmutation night.</em></p>",
