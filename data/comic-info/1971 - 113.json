            "description": "<p>In the first story titled, <b>\"Rescue Mission,\" </b>Splinter and Knothead receive a distress message on their HAM radio that is traced to Alaska.   Woody heads to the arctic with the kids to deliver the requested supplies (fish) in their attempt to aid the person in need and receive a reward that was mentioned in the transmission.  Unbeknown-st to the gang, Buzz Buzzard hitches a ride to try and circumvent the delivery of the fish and steal the reward. Woody manage to locate the distressed caller and discover that it was their old friend Chilly Willy.  After grabbing the fish from Woody, Buzz attempts to deliver the fish to Chilly to receive the reward.  The hungry Polar Bear that was looking at Chilly as the next item on the menu, smells the fish and chases Buzz. <br />The reward turns out to be a bucket of blubber that Woody decides to relinquish to Buzz after all.  <br /><br />In the second story, <b>\"Four Alarm Fizzle\"</b>, Woody works as a volunteer fireman and gets called out to rescue a cat (Poopsi) from the top of a telephone pole. After several failed attempts and harrowing experiences, Woody learns from the cat's owner that it was a all a game and that the cat considered this whole event as a play date. With the cat safely on the ground, Woody is offered a reward as a thank you for keeping the cat entertained.  <br /><br /><b>\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" </b>finds Woody winning $5,000.00 in a game show only to be spotted by Buzz Buzzard, who has his own plan to remove that money from the lucky woodpecker. Woody is nickel and dimed to death as Buzz poses as a financial investor advisor guiding him to a search for a buried treasure that doesn't exist.  Unfortunately for Buzz,....Woody uncovers a real treasure and rides off as a rich bird!  <br /><br /> <b>\"The Talent Tryout\"</b> takes us to the arctic, where a talent scout from the main land visits Chilly Willy's neighborhood looking for talent worthy of  Hollywood. After many failed tryouts, the gang performs a swimming routine that engages the scout so much so that he misses the big ships' departure leaving him stranded on the ice with the gang.</p>",
