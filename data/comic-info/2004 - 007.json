She declines as she believes that Captain America and him set her up, ultimately getting her locked up in \"Gitmo\". Falcon explains that the Rivas drug cartel believes that Cap and he killed one of the cartel leaders and have now sent \"The Saint\" to kill them. Knowing that she was involved in the past, Falcon believes that they will go after her first in order to get to either Cap or him. He recommends that they all stick together as he can provide some protection for the time being. Just then, her boyfriend comes in the room and notices Falcon. He tries to get Falcon to leave and a scuffle ensues. Needless to say Falcon wins and the boyfriend backs down.</p><p>Falcon and Cap wake up the next morning at Cap's house.

Hyperion's military handlers are berated by the U.S. N.S.A (National Security Agency and Central Security Service)'s Bryce, who informs them that he regards Hyperion's good works as a waste of money and resources that should be devoted to the United States running roughshod over the rest of the planet with the world's most terrifying weapon at their beck and call. The Generals defend their use of Hyperion as a tool of misdirection to allow the use of Joe Ledger (Doctor Spectrum) as a super-powered covert weapon. As Hyperion leaves the scene of the fire, a dark haired man in a suit hands him a folded slip of paper.</p><p>S.C.U.B.A. diver Connie is enjoying the coastal reefs when a mysterious amphibian humanoid spots her and tries to make contact. The diver flees, tearing her oxygen line on coral in her haste, drowning. The creature gathers Connie's body and brings her to a boat on the surface, where Connie's associate snaps a picture and then attacks the creature with a speargun. Angered, the creature spouts nasty looking spikes and sinks the boat.</p><p>Following instructions on the folded slip of paper, Hyperion goes to Beijing and meets with a man who speculates that Hyperion's actions are a diversion, that terrible things that could only be accomplished by a being of similar power level are being done on the other side of the world while Hyperion's whereabouts are clearly identified and documented. He further believes that Hyperion is unaware of these activities, and might be well served by attempting to identify the other being. He also warns Hyperion that seemingly different parties can be controlled by a single shadowy figure.</p><p>After a nasty discussion with Bryce, Hyperion decides that rather than show up at Bryce's planned event at 8pm, he would rather locate and confront the other super powered U.S. human weapon. He scans Germany, Bolivia, and then finally encounters the other force in Somalia. In a nova-powered explosion, Hyperion pile drives into Doctor Spectrum (Joe Ledger).</p><p><b>General Notes</b></p><p>Richard Isanove contributes inks to the cover only.</p>",

Using their skills as best suits the situation, the X-Men save innocents, or telepathically compel them to move to safety, or use their powers to force the creature back into its hole. The team is soon joined by the Fantastic Four, who combine their powers with the X-Men, forcing the monster into the hole from which it emerged. Returning back to the mansion, the team is dismayed that their heroics played for less than thirty seconds on the news, while a star’s scandal garnered more than three minutes. As the group discusses whether they can ever get a fair shake with the media, one of the students, Hisako, arrives, worried about another missing student, Wing. She is joined by the Stepford Cuckoos and the telepathic Blindfold, who is only able to speak a cryptic warning. Elsewhere, in the Danger Room, Wing lies dead on the floor. Having been in a simulation of the ravine outside the school grounds, he tried to fly – despite having received “the Cure.” With his death, the simulation ends. Elsewhere, Special Agent Brand faces an inquiry into her recent action before a S.W.O.R.D. committee. Rather than apologetic, she states that she regrets nothing and would go to any means to safeguard the planet. She awaits their judgment.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>\"HAUNTED\" PART 1 (OF 3) </em><em>Someone…or something…is haunting the halls of the Xavier Institute, and it’s up to the New X-Men to get to the bottom of it! Plus, what is the secret of Prodigy’s younger sister?</em></p> <p>David’s younger sister, Kim, arrives at Xavier’s to visit her brother. David first introduces Kim to the rest of his New Mutants squad, and next gives her a tour around the school and its many classes. Kim is very impressed and a little jealous as well, because she thinks that her school is boring compared to Xavier’s. Meanwhile, weird things are happening around the Institute. It begins with Icarus. While preparing for gym, his picture of his lost love Julia starts to crack, and he didn’t even touch it! He freaks out and sulks about it. Surge notices that and talks to him, but they only end up in an argument that Jay once tried to kill himself because he thought he had lost everything. Noriko, upset hearing that, knows that isn’t true, because Jay still has a family that loves him, and runs away to her room. There, she tries to contact her parents again and phones them, but her father doesn’t believe that it’s really Noriko calling them and hangs up on her. Noriko gets even more upset and stays in the room. After a while, Jay enters to apologize, and they both find Noriko’s room trashed! But Nori didn’t trash it, and neither did her roommate. At the lab, Wither and Wall Flower find a beaker smashed, and later a threatening message gets written on the blackboard, to “leave now.” Some time later, the New Mutants begin their Danger Room session and Kim gets to watch. Some of the squad members panic, but David suspects that it’s all just a prank of Julians. After a successful training session, Noriko doesn’t feel well after an overload of her powers. Dani goes to check on her and Kim has to stay behind in the observation deck. A ghost appears next to her and, after feeling that Kim is different, it warns Kim to get out of the place while she can and then disappears. Overjoyed, Kim rushes to Dani and the New Mutants, telling them that she has just found out that she is a mutant! <br /> <br /><b>Trivia:</b> This issue marks the first appearance of popular New X-men <a href=\"../../trance/29-40885/\" rel=\"nofollow\">   Trance</a> (in a cameo) and <a href=\"../../indra/29-40671/\" rel=\"nofollow\">  Indra</a>. <br /></p><p> </p>",

Thanos arrives at the Crunch, the edge of the expanding universe. He enters the office for the Omega Core, a frontier security group. He wants to visit the Kyln, and is taking the trouble of going through official channels to do so. After a short conflict with the Omega Core officers Cole, Swad, and Kika, he is allowed to beam up to the Kyln. The Kyln is a series of extremely large linked space stations that absorb energy from the expanding edge of the universe, while also acting as high security prisons for major cosmic threats, and are also important to a cult that has arisen around the Crunch.</p><p>Shortly after being briefed on the Kyln protcols by an officer, he is visited by Death, who appears as a little girl. They discuss their relationship, with Death telling Thanos that a number of his ideas about her are incorrect. She does, however, love him, and thinks he can still learn to love her.</p>",

The child isn't one like any other but the son of Aegir, the God of the Ocean. Or at least that's what the Vikings believe.</p><h4>The metal that doesn't exist</h4><p>The Father of the Dwarves, Ivaldir, lost a game of checkers to the snake Nidhogg. They were playing for the name of the loser but snake would settle for the metal that doesn't exist. A loyal dwarf named Tjadzhi is sent out to find this metal and after a long journey and surviving many dangers he finally finds it. A very young Thorgal is wearing it like a piece of jewelry around is neck and together they bring it to the snake to safe the Father of the Dwarves.</p><h4>The Amulet</h4><p>The last story is about a teen Thorgal that tries to find the God that came to live with humans. He wants him to help him find out who his real father is. Together they use futuristic technolgy to look into the past. This way he learns who his parents and grandparents were and what happened on the space ship that brought him here.</p><p> </p>",
