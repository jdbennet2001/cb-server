The two battle until the angel senses Daimon Hellstrom (Hellstorm) is in trouble nearby and flies off to help him. Frank follows, finding the Son of Satan and Gadriel about to be destroyed by demons, the minions of Olivier, the fallen Prince of Archangels. The Punisher is forced to save them to get the answers he so desperately seeks.</p><p>The trio turn back the demons, and Punisher chases after them.  Hellstorm summons his infernal chariot, intent on returning to his own realm to protect it from Olivier.  Before he departs, however, he warns Gadriel that it would be better for him if he reveals a truth he's hiding from Castle, before Castle learns it from the demons.</p><p>Meanwhile, in his lair in a mystical nexus located in the top of the Flatiron Building, Olivier plots his revenge against the Lords of Hell who cast him out. He assembles his forces to assault the different realms in Hell to punish those who have wronged him. When he learns that Frank Castle is alive, the news angers him greatly and he tortures his minions who failed him.</p><p>Elsewhere, Lucy Mellace's husband recovers in a hospital from the beating he got from Castle.  He blames her for what happened, but she ignores him.  Looking out the window, she wonders what has happened to Frank, whom she remembers from her childhood.</p><p>Later, Gadriel captures one of the demons that attacked him, but can’t get him to talk. Castle questions the demon who reveals that its human existence was ended by the Punisher. Gadriel then destroys the demon before it can say any more, leaving Frank wondering just how all this insanity is linked to him, and if Gadriel has told him nothing but lies for his own agenda. </p>",

While he visits their graves, at a Russian military research camp dubbed “Province 13”, the director, General Sergei, makes his rounds. As he watches a nurse test a boy and a girl for psychic abilities, he conemplates what he considers his wasted career trying to find gifted mutant youngsters. He is shaken from his thoughts as, for an instant, he feels the mind of the girl, Nanya, touch his. He is then notified of a call for him from Moscow.</p><p>Back at the village, Piotr enters a church next to the cemetary and finds within an old woman praying. She turns and rises to meet him, but upon recognizing Piotr, she spits at his feet and expresses contempt for his family. Through tears, she tells him he should have never returned, and he sadly exits.</p><p>Not far away, Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) and Logan (Wolverine) stroll through the snowy woods. They come to an area where the trees appear twisted and dead, and also find two oddly withered deer carcasses. A gunshot rings out, and Logan decides to investigate.</p><p>A squad of Russian soldiers storm the churchyard and approach the elderly woman, indent on taking her into custody. Piotr returns in his armored form of Colossus to defend her and is shot at by the soldiers and their helicopter, but the shells merely bounce of his metallic skin. Shortly, more troops enter the church, but all they find is a collapsed wall through which Colossus escaped with the woman, and a deep tunnel freshly dug into the floor of the church.</p><p>Nearby, Wolverine and Nightcrawler confront two soldiers, Gregor and Valerie, who are searching for an escapee from the camp. As the four tensely face-off, the soldiers’ quarry, a huge grotesquely misshapen creature enters the scene and attacks the group. Wolverine slashes at it, but stops, confused, and falls to his knees. As Nightcrawler tends to him, a helicopter sets down. The troops hold the two X-Men at gunpoint, and then drag away the unconscious Wolverine. With little choice, Nightcrawler teleports to a nearby treetop, where he can only watch as the chopper fries off with his friend aboard.</p><p>In his office at Province 13, General Sergei is on the phone with his superior in Moscow. He is told that the facility is to be assessed for its value to the government, and so his superior will arrive two days hence for an inspection. Shortly after hanging up, Sergei receives another call, a report from his men indicating they have not yet succeeded in apprehending the escaped creature, which he refers to as “Nikolas”. Sergei continues, saying he authorizes “more drastic measures”.</p><p>In time, a Russian helicopter flies over the jungle canopy of the Savage Land, searching. Soon, a metallic tentacle whips up and grasps the landing gear. The soldiers aboard confront their assailant, the exiled Arkady Rossovich, also known as Omega Red. They tell him they are there to take him home.</p>",

He confronts the auctioneer, Audra Pennington, and hypnotizes her, forcing her to cancel the sale and dismiss the buyers.  Interrogating her, Dracula learns the stolen goods were sold to her by an Anton Florescu.  He compels Audra to make arrangements to have his possessions shipped back to Castle Dracula.</p><p>     He exits the gallery, and flies off in his bat form, only to be struck with an arrow.  He tackles his fleeing assailant, who turns out to be Florescu.  Rather than give up any information, the man snaps his own neck and dies.</p><p>     Elsewhere in England, Dr. Charles Seward, having completed the development of his vampiric suppression serum, enjoys a reunion dinner with his wife Jane, and their two daughters.  However, his joy is shattered when he sees TV news reports of a viral plague decimating the people of the town of Littlepool, where he first used his untested serum.  As he realizes his culpability for the outbreak, he receives a phone call from his unseen employer who orders Seward back to work to correct the side effect.  Against Jane's protests, he leaves.</p><p>     Dracula, oddly hungering though he recently fed, chances upon the quarantined Littlepool, and noting the dozens of corpses in the streets, descends to investigate.  He finds his minion, Maltz, who disintegrates before his eyes.  He then discovers Seward, who is taking samples from bodies.  Seward surmises that since his own blood was used as the base of the serum, he is immune to the virus.  Dracula confronts the doctor, who introduces himself as the great-grandson of Dr. John Seward, an adversary of the vampire from a century before.</p><p>     As Seward explains the nature of this plague and the possibility of it wiping out humanity, and thus Dracula's only food source, the vampire lord feels an overwhelming hunger as well as finding flesh is withering at an accelerated pace.
