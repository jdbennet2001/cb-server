She is the example of a life ruined by an unwanted mutation, which can be fixed by Rao’s so-called “cure.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the X-Men arrive at the hostage situation and make short work of the gunmen. However, their leader, a possible mutant claiming to be called Ord, of the Breakworld, easily defeats the X-Men in turn. Ord is forced to retreat, however, when Lockheed arrives and uses his flame breath, against which Ord is unprepared.</p><p>At the press conference afterward, the team learns of the claims of Doctor Rao of having discovered a cure for mutants. They continue the discussion back at the mansion but table the issue for the next day. After the meeting, Emma tries to bury the animosity between Kitty and herself, only to realize that it is much deeper than she ever thought.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, the Beast manages to sneak past security and break into the company sponsoring Doctor Rao’s research, Benetech, only to be discovered by Doctor Rao herself. Their conversation begins to turn into an argument, until the Beast admits that he’s not there to discuss the ethics of the situation but to know if the cure works for his own reasons.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The murder of one of Madrox’s dupes sends the original Jamie on a quest to the Windy City of Chicago to determine just who was responsible... unaware that Clay, the assassin who killed his dupe, is still stalking him, determined to finish the job.</em></p><p><b>Issue Summary</b></p><p>Under the cover of the El train tacks, a lone man finds himself surrounded by three men, one of whom punches him squarely in the stomach. Seeing the man buckle to his knees, the attacker scoffs, asking the man, whom he calls Stringer, if that is it. One punch? That’s all it takes for a tough reporter like him? After all those stories he wrote about Mr. Carpetti… he should’a seen this coming, doesn’t he think?</p><p>Spitting his words out through the blood in his mouth, Striger promises that he will lay off. Laughing at this, the man repeats that he will lay off… <em>after</em> the D.A.’s opened an investigation. A little late, the man states ominously. Suddenly, the tenseness of the situation is eased every-so slightly by an amused <em>Wow</em>. Turning to see the new arrival, the men see a relaxed Madrox, his hands absent-mindedly resting in his pocket. This is exciting, he continues. I mean… it doesn’t get any more <em>noir</em> than this.</p><p>“Nwar,” the head of the gang repeats inquisitively. What the heck’s “nwar?” Hearing the answer from one of his cohorts, the first and his companion at his side turn around. Their cohort explains that the new arrival is referring to “film noir,” – a French term literally meaning “dark film” – pertaining to 1950’s crime movies noted for their cynical, amoral characters in a sleazy setting, pervaded with a sense of hopelessness. Having received his answer, the first tells his cohort to shut up – which he complies – and returns his attention to Madrox.</p><p>Rather than return the attention, Madrox moves to Stringer, who is still sitting on the concrete. When Madrox tells the reporter that it’s been awhile, Stringer curses at seeing his old acquaintance, lamenting that as if his day doesn’t already suck. Seeing this interchange, the lead thug reminds Madrox of the news flash: this ain’t no movie. To this, he bets Madrox that a shot to the stomach makes him double over, too. Daring a wry smile, Madrox bets the man that he’s right.</p><p>On cue, the thug launches his right fist into Madrox’s stomach, causing a duplicate to emerge behind him. The left cross that follows creates yet another to Madrox’s right. The thug barely has a moment to notice what has happened before the three Madroxes return the favor and begin to pummel him back. As he and his dupes go to work, Madrox notes to himself that the man had no way of knowing that each impact just creates more duplicates. The question, he thinks, is not whether this joker is screwed… but by what multiple of <em>screwed</em> is he screwed?</p><p>The first thug quickly knocked out, his cohorts turn tail and run, leaving behind Madrox yelling at them to step up – six fists, no waiting. Quickly finding that they are alone, Stringer, hardly thankful, asks Madrox what the blazes he’s doing in Chicago. Looking for him, the prime Madrox replies. It’s lucky for him they jumped him right near his apartm… Interrupting the prime, one duplicated Madrox dabs a cloth at Stringer’s bloodied mouth, lamenting the action of those thugs, brutalizing such an exquisite face. To this, he then asks Stringer if anyone has ever told him that he has a very <em>shapely</em> mouth.</p><p>Stringer begins to ask what is going on but Madrox feigns ignorance, absorbing both duplicates. As he is absorbed, the dupe entranced by Stringer tells Madrox that he’s in denial – and Madrox notes that this could turn into his latest problem – starting rumors about himself. Stringer jumps on the implication telling Madrox that he didn’t know he was… Madrox quickly replies that he’s not. But, y’know, everybody has some little bit of that… Just as quickly as Madrox’s protestation, Stringer rejoins that he doesn’t.</p><p>Whatever, Madrox replies, changing the subject. He needs his help – he needs access to the Trib’s archives and he figured <em>he’s</em> the reporter to help him. Shrugging off Madrox’s buddy-embrace, Stringer tells him to forget it. The last thing he needs is to be seen hangin’ with a mutant. Calling out to Stringer, Madrox tells him he <em>wounds</em> him. Or could it have anything to do with… he doesn’t know… <em>him</em> being a mutant? Placing his a finger to his lips and looking skyward in contemplation, Madrox wonders aloud how many subjects would talk to him if they knew he could read minds. Not many, he bets. Gee, he further ponders, maybe he’d have to give <em>back</em> his Pulitzer Prize.</p><p>Unable to counter Madrox’s move, Stringer simply tells Madrox that he hates him. This out of the way, he then adds that they’ll go in the morning. Great, Madrox says. He’ll crash at his place – does he still have that comfy sofa? Hit again with the realization that Madrox will be spending the night, Stringer now tells him that he <em>really</em> hates him.</p><p>(New York)</p><p>Standing on the observation balcony amongst tourists, a man speaks into his mobile phone incredulously. <em>Alive</em>? he asks – is he sure? In reply, the voice on the other end tells Clay that he has many connections and word reached him through one of them that someone named “Madrox” hit the town last night. Taking this, Clay supposes that it might not be him, but after hearing from his caller that the Madrox duplicated himself Clay states that it is.</p><p>Diverting his attention to his surroundings, Clay studies a man looking through one of the many pay-telescopes that line the balcony. The man is middle-aged, over-weight, sporting a conservative haircut and clad in a blue business suit, in contrast to Clay’s attire. Covering his deep-tanned skin, which is in turn covered by a patterned white tattoo, is a simple tank-top t-shirt, over which Clay has almost casually thrown a brown coat. His hair is long and pure white, contrasting his skin. His sunglasses, worn as if they are never taken off, hide his eyes.</p><p>Continuing their conversation, the voice on the mobile asks Clay if it was possible he only stabbed a duplicate. Dismissing the accusation, Clay retorts that he stabbed his target: the Jamie Madrox who returned to New York three days ago from Chicago, watched him stagger away, bleeding. No way he survived. When told by the voice that he didn’t kill the original, Clay states that he wasn’t hired to. For all he knows, the one in Chicago <em>now</em> is another dupe.</p><p>Dupe or not, the voice states, he’s probably investigating the first one’s death. With a half-hearted “prob’ly,” Clay walks behind the man peering through the telescope, as if waiting next in line to use it. Unaware of Clay’s wandering attention, the voice orders him to kill every Madrox he can find, until they stop coming. To this, Clay replies that he’s on <em>another</em> job, only to hear the voice order him to cut it short. With almost a sneer, Clay closes the clamshell of his mobile, voicing a “fine.” Moments later, the middle-aged, over-weight, business suit clad man finds himself hurtling down from the observation balcony to the unforgiving terra firma below.</p><p>Elsewhere, in Mutant Town, Rahne asks the Madrox dupe what he is doing. Answering the rhetorical questions, the dupe holds up a window pane and replies that he’s putting in a new glass. Dismissing the thought, Rahne reminds the dupe that his “original self” set up the detective agency, and suggests that they wait for him to get back before they make any changes. Sniping back that “wait” is for watchers, the dupe turns his attention to Guido, asking how the sign is coming along.</p><p>Announcing that it’s almost done, Guido finishes and then presents the stenciled window on the door and asks what the rest think. Taking a moment to inspect the window, now with the logo of “XXX Investigations” and “Jamie Madrox, president,” Rahne informs him that she thinks it’s backwards. When Guido doesn’t get it, she asks him to open the door. When he complies, he realizes that the logo is facing the inside… making it backwards to those approaching the door for entrance. “Aw crud,” he grimaces.</p><p>Before he closes it, Guido finds someone on the other side of the door – a brunette, asking if the place is XXX Investigations. Remembering the problem with the window, Guido asks how she could tell. Before she can answer, however, Rahne suggests that maybe she’s dyslexic. Taking charge of the situation before they lose their prospective client, the Madrox dupe tells her that she’s in the right place, and asks how he can help her.</p><p>Following Madrox to his desk, the woman introduces herself as Carol Campbell. Her husband and she live there in Mutant Town. A little surprised that she’s a mutant, the Madrox dupe asks if she minds what her power is but, leaning against the desk, Carol states that he does. As Madrox recoils a little at the social faux pas, Carol composes herself and continues with her problem – she believes her husband, Ned, is cheating on her. When asked by Madrox if she means with another woman, Carol glares back and with an icy and sarcastic voice replies <em>no… with a cocker spaniel</em>. Half turning to Guido, who is sitting at his left, Madrox guesses aloud that he walked into <em>that</em> one. Guido guesses back aloud that he did… “Holmes.”</p><p>Turning back to Mrs. Campbell, Madrox asks her is she has <em>seen</em> him with another woman. Receiving a no, he then asks if she’s caught him with lipstick on his collar. A strange bra in his pocket? Again receiving a “no” and “nothing like that,” Madrox presses further. In response, Carol states that he calls out her name every night. “Kim! Kim!” He thrashes around… it’s disgraceful! Pressing her point, Carol tells Jamie that he has to find her! She needs to confront her! Reviewing the situation, Madrox tells that Carol that her only proof is that he talk about her in his sleep. To this, Carol counters that if she had photographs, she wouldn’t need him, would she? Fair enough, Madrox states.</p><p>Chiming in, Rahne tells Madrox that they can follow him. She can be verrrrry stealthy. Telling Rahne that it’s a good idea, he then tells Mrs. Campbell that she can inform them when he’s preparing to go out and… Interrupting Madrox, Mrs. Campbell dismisses the idea with a wave of her hand, informing the group that he <em>never</em> heads out – he’s a quadriplegic. She believes he’s cheating by way of <em>astral projection</em>. As thrown off balance from this concept as Rahne and Guido, Madrox manages to mutter a wide-eyes <em>terrific</em>.</p><p>(Chicago)</p><p>Madrox – the original – follows Stringer through the halls of the Chicago Tribune, thinking about their shared history. They originally met back during his “X-Factor days,” and kept in touch. Well, Madrox has with him. Stringer… he’s always afraid he’ll “out” him - and Madrox can’t imagine that. Being so afraid of what people might think of him that he has to keep his true nature under wraps. Then again, when he has it in his power to <em>never</em> be alone, fears of being shunned aren’t a big priority.</p><p>As they approach the archives, Madrox explains to Stringer about his reabsorbing his stabbed wayward dupe, and getting flashes of Chicao-related images from his dying mind. Images including a woman from his May 24th Tribune clipping. Showing his boundless sympathy at Madrox’s story, Stringer replies, “like I care about your problems.”</p><p>As the two enter the research room, Stringer then points out to Madrox that he could’ve pulled this up from the public library. Dismissing the idea, Madrox retorts that he’s not wild about libraries. Y’never know if the FBI’s watching. Chuckling at this with a “cripes,” Stringer replies that he thought <em>he</em> was paranoid. Drawing Madrox’s attention to the room and the computer he’s sitting at, Stringer informs him that they used to call the file room “the Morgue.” You’d rustle through manila folders with ancient clippings. It smelled of <em>news</em> in there. Now, it smells of Pinesol and the screen gives him a headache. Now, is that progress?</p><p>As Stringer ticks away at the keyboard, Madrox reclines in a chair and grins. Stringer pretends he’s a cynic, he thinks. That’s okay. It’s how he disguises his basic optimism. He can relate. He makes jokes. Cracks wise. Grins like a fool. Best way to cover total despair. He can live <em>any</em> life he wants. Follow any direction. Follow all potential fates simultaneously. But if <em>everything’s</em> possible… then what’s the point of <em>anything</em>? It’s all…</p><p>Leaping from his chair in mid-thought, Jamie tells Stringer to stop. Pointing to the monitor screen, he says that that’s the photo he saw… the clipping. Turning half around to Madrox, Stringer asks if he’s kidding him. When Madrox denies it, Stringer then tells him to tell him he’s kidding him. Detecting a pattern, Madrox asks Stringer if he knows her. Still in disbelief that Madrox is ignorant of who he has picked out, Stringer informs him that the woman is Sheila Desoto – longtime lover… and newly minted fiancée of Edward Vance, a multi-million dollar industrialist… with alleged ties to organized crime. To this, Stringer adds that Madrox will want to steer clear of her. In fact, if his dupe didn’t, that’s why he “bought” it, guaranteed.</p><p>Reading the article, Madrox notes that it says May 24th was her birthday party. Apparently, it was a huge bash. No shock there, Stringer states. Eddie Vance invites you, you come running no matter who you are. To this, Stringer asks Madrox how his dupe got to know her. Receiving a “no clue,” Stringer chides him as “some detective.” Unaffected by the jest, Madrox counters that if he knew, he’s have nothing to detect.</p><p>After having Stringer print a copy of the photo clipping, Madrox asks Stringer is he knows where she lives. <em>Everybody</em> knows where she lives, he states. She lives in Vance’s gated mansion on Riverside. He’ll never get in. Examining the photo, Madrox informs Stringer that he studied with the shaolin. He’s be <em>amazed</em> what he can do. Now remarking at the photo, Madrox notes that she’s quite the hottie. Scorching, Stringer replies – the kind that gets you killed, <em>grasshopper</em>. Countering this, Madrox reminds Stringer that they already killed him. Didn’t take. Besides, look at her, he states. She’s definitely to die for.</p><p>(New York)</p><p>Welcoming in his fare, the cab driver asks Clay if it’s his first time in New York. Slumped in the seat, his eyes hidden behind his sunglasses, though it is night, Clay tells the driver that he’s actually been there a few days. Really? the driver asks. Most fares he picks up from the Port Authority, they just got there. Almost in random though, the driver then asks Clay if he heard about that jumper at the Empire State Building. Some people…</p><p>Finally getting to business, the driver asks Clay where he can take him. Rather than answering, Clay asks as question of his own. A couple of days ago, Clay states, the driver had a young fellow <em>bleeding</em> in the cab. He knows this because he noted his license plate when the man got in. Where did he drop him? Taken aback, the driver tells his fare, “No way. No <em>freaking</em> way.” He was glad enough to get rid of the guy and if he thinks he’s going to let himself get dragged any more into this mess he’s… Noting the pistol being pointed at this face, the driver finishes his thought, “… a reaaaally good guesser.”</p><p>(Chicago)</p><p>Standing outside the stone wall surrounding the Vance Estate, Madrox notes to himself that he heard tell it is the nicest house in Chicago. It’s nice to know he’s got such good taste. Or at least his dupe had.</p><p>Changing his thoughts to his dupe, Jamie thinks that he’d feel better about it if his dupes weren’t so unpredictable lately. They’ve developed <em>independent</em> streak before, he recalls, but some of them are hitting new heights of behavior. Rapping his knuckles against the wall five times, Madrox is quickly joined by five dupes, the first of which announces sheepishly that he can’t say he approves of this. It’s trespassing. A second opines that if one of them was having it off with another man’s girl, he deserved what he got. A third berates the second, calling him a freaking wuss. He was one of them! They send one of them to the <em>morgue</em>, they send one of theirs to the freakin’ <em>cornfield</em>. That’s the Chicago way!</p><p>Hearing the fourth muse about the cycle of violence and the fifth asking about what is on television, Madrox yells out to them that he’s doing this. Now, he can either keep making new dupes until he gets five cooperative ones, or they can save him some time, okay? As the five begin to form a ladder against the wall, three as a base with the remaining two standing on the bottom three’s shoulders, Madrox thinks of how Wolverine doesn’t have to put with this. Not Spider-Man neither. The Hulk, kinda sorta… but even so…</p><p>Between reaching the top of the wall and jumping down, Madrox reabsorbs the dupes. This bunch was pretty conspicuous, he thinks. For all he knows, left on their own one of them would have felt morally obligated to alert Vance’s people that he’s there. You’d think that he, of all people, could trust himself to cover his own back.</p><p>Before stepping from the wall, Madrox notices a security camera perched on a tree, quickly betting to himself that it’s not the only one. Fortunately, he reflects, as he runs into the woods, he wasn’t just blowing smoke about the shaolin thing. If having dupes argue with each other is the downside of absorbing different memories and experiences from his long-term “explorer” dupes… the acquired knowledge is a definite plus.</p><p>Lowering the cup of coffee from his mouth, one of the estate’s security guards asks his partner if he just saw… Taking a moment to raise his eyes from the paper, on whose headline reads “Magneto alive again?” the second guard asks if he saw what? Now studying the security monitor closely but seeing nothing, the guard guesses that he imagined it.</p><p>Stalking the estate through the shroud of darkness, Madrox makes his way through the woods. Best thing, he thinks, is to come around from the back. Moving closer to the mansion itself, he quickly notes the smell of chlorine ahead… and the sound of splashing; must be a pool. Noting that the cameras look to be turned away from it, Madrox surmises that Vance apparently likes his privacy. Emerging from the woods, Madrox thinks that he sees why.</p><p>Swimming through the enormous pool is a vision of beauty, whose name is Sheila Desoto. Swimming alone, Sheila has on a two-piece bathing suit, although she wears only the bottom. Yup, Madrox, thinks – to die for. After a few breathless moments of watching, Madrox orders his own heart to resume beating, his lungs to start breathing again. Then, as Sheila begins to rise from the pool at the ladder, Madrox finally forces himself into action – but first asking what Bogie would do…</p><p>Sheila is startled at the sound of a male voice as she dries off with her towel, perhaps even more so by the flippant, “Nice night for a swim, eh gorgeous?” The shock is short-lives, however, as she immediately recognized Madrox, yelling out <em>James!!! Oh, thank God!!!</em> Discarding her towel, Sheila runs to James, uncaring that she is once again topless, and kisses him deeply. <em>Score</em>, thinks Madrox.</p><p>Finally breaking the kiss but not the embrace, Sheila grins at Jamie, telling him that he tastes like candy. It was a chocolate cigarette, he replies. When then notes that she’s shivering, Sheila promptly asks Jamie to warm her, beginning again a kiss. As their moment of intimacy continues, Madrox thinks to himself that he has absolutely no idea what’s going on… and he couldn’t care less.</p><p>(New York)</p><p>Speaking on the phone, the Madrox dupe sits at the desk, talking to Rahne. Confirming that she’s staked out outside the Campbell’s apartment, he asks if she really thinks she can track an astral projection, presuming there is one. As he listens to Rahne’s response, the dupe is unaware that he has come into the crosshairs of a rifle’s scope. A moment later, the Madrox dupe slumps from the chair, a spray of blood splattering on the window, now shattered by the sniper’s bullet. In an apartment across the street, the sniper, Clay, remarks “two down.” His sunglasses temporarily set upon his head, Clay looks across the street at his handiwork with his naked eyes, which are all white, lacking any iris or pupils.</p><p>In Chicago, the original Madrox recoils in the pain of his dupe being shot. As Sheila tries to understand what is happening, Madrox loses his balance and falls into the pool. Still unable to regain his mental composure, Madrox sinks to the bottom.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>They say money makes the world go 'round. Mary Jane Watson doesn't know who \"they\" are, but she sure wishes \"they\" would help her to become financially independent!</em></p><p>The Manhattan Bridge.</p><p>New York.</p><p>Riding into town on the subway, Mary Jane keeps an eye out for Spider-Man.</p><p>MJ meets Liz at the mall, where the two shop for Homecoming dresses. Liz picks out dress after dress, but MJ's heart just into in it. MJ laments that she's been looking everywhere for Spider-Man, but she just can't find him and she doesn't want to go to Homecoming alone. Liz flips out at MJ, telling her to forget about Spidey and focus on Harry, but MJ says she only thinks of Harry as a friend.</p><p>That night, Harry takes MJ out. The two sit on a bench on a quay and talk. Harry is about to ask MJ to Homecoming when she interrupts him and manages to change the subject. Later, Mary Jane becomes annoyed at the fact that Harry is paying for everything - dinner, movie, cabs and snacks - and decides that she needs to get a job.</p><p>MJ gets a job at the Happy Happy Hippo, a fast-food burger joint, but struggles. She messes up orders and is simply overwhelmed by all of the customers. MJ is so tired out by her job that she starts falling asleep in school, and her grades are slipping because of it.</p><p>At the Coffee Bean, Harry and Flash discuss Mary Jane. Harry tells Flash that he thinks that everything is going great with MJ, but even he has some doubts. Peter walks by, and is once again accosted by Flash. Liz and MJ soon join the two buddies, and they all tell MJ that she's working too hard and that she should quit. MJ tells them she can't, because she's getting her first paycheck that night.</p><p>The paycheck, however, is a complete disappointment and MJ quits, deciding to try other jobs. MJ works in a video store, as a waitress, a receptionist and even a cleaning lady but messes up every time.</p><p>Later, at a movie with Harry, MJ falls asleep. Harry prods her awake, and tells her that she's working too hard and doesn't have to, because he's willing and able to pay for everything. MJ says she's hopeful that she'll find the perfect job, and is distracted by a poster of Spider-Man in a bus shelter. Harry looks on sadly as MJ stares at her idol.</p><p>At school the next day, MJ is sent to the guidance counsellor, who is worried about her grades and how tired she constantly is. The counsellor tells her that other students are working 40-hours a week to keep a roof over their heads and food in their bellies, and asks MJ what she's working for. MJ reveals that she wants money so that she can do things with her friends without feeling like a burden, but that she's given up on finding a good job.</p><p>At the mall, Mary Jane gazes longingly at the dress she had picked out for Homecoming. A salesperson asks her if she would like to try it on, but MJ tells her she can't afford it. The woman tells her that one of her staff is on maternity leave, and gives MJ a job that she guarantees will get her the dress and more. MJ accepts happily.</p>",

If Peter Parker wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider would he still do battle with a madman named Norman Osborn? Matt Murdock, though blinded, had no heightened senses. Nevertheless, he became a legal champion of the poor in Hell's Kitchen, crossing paths with a powerful crime boss named Wilson Fisk -- the Kingpin. Logan, still an enigmatic, amnesiac drifter, is on the run from his bloody past, without mutant powers to save him. By re- imagining Marvel's most popular characters without superhuman powers, this series will strip these heroes to their core, exploring what it means to be a hero in very human terms.</i>",

Above all it is a great love story, an epic account of Class II Space Patrolman Masato's tragic, undying love for the doomed beautiful alien \"moopie,\" Tamami. Told in bold layouts and mind-warping page designs that revolutionized Japanese comics, this is the work of the greatest manga artist of them all, Osamu Tezuka, soaring at the height of his powers.</i>",

What happens when best friends are torn from one another in the name of school policy? And what do the <i>New X-Men </i>do about it? </em></p><p>As the kids react to the news that they may be split up soon, <a href=\"/hellion/4005-40454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\"> Julian</a> arrives to spoil the moment by threatening to tell on them for being in the <a href=\"/danger-room/4020-41918/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41918\"> Danger Room </a>unsupervised. An argument ensues, but <a href=\"/renascence/4005-40537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40537\"> Sofia</a> manages to get Julian to keep it a secret by working Julian’s crush on her. The kids attempt to get <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\"> Dani</a> to explain what is going on, but she tells them she is too busy at the moment. <a href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\"> Nori</a> meets her new roommate, <a href=\"/dust/4005-4555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\"> Sooraya Qadir aka Dust</a>, and they immediately get into a disagreement over their beliefs on women’s rights and religion. Nori leaves, and is soon found by <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\"> Cyclops</a>, who demands his keycard back, and warns her that the rules are in place for her safety. He admits that he was impressed by the way they handled the Danger Room and decides not to punish her or the others, but tells her to get her <a href=\"/surges-gauntlets/4055-56424/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56424\"> gauntlets</a> looked over. She asks if she can’t just get rid of them, but Cyclops convinces her to give them another try, and after a brief conversation, they head off in their own directions. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/prodigy/4005-40475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\"> David</a> isn’t pleased about the possible changes, and decides that he will tell Dani the next day that he is leaving, though <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\"> Josh</a> isn’t convinced. The following day, Julian meets up with <a href=\"/icarus/4005-9739/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9739\"> Jay Guthrie </a>and tells him that they both have <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\"> Emma Frost </a>as an advisor. Julian explains about codenames, and Jay says that Icarus would be his choice. The two arrive at the basketball court, where a three-on-three game soon begins: David, Josh, and Sofia versus Julian, <a href=\"/mercury/4005-15078/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15078\"> Cessily,</a> and <a href=\"/rockslide/4005-40456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40456\"> Santo</a>. <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\"> Iceman</a> drops in to referee, and after an impressive show of powers from both teams, Cessily scores the winning basket. After the game, the kids arrive too see Dani, and find out that she wanted to see them too. After a small amount of convincing, the kids agree to trust Dani on it, and she shows them templates of training uniforms, which they will be allowed to customize as they like. Monday’s Assembly arrives, and Cyclops explains that all students will be put into training squads of six people. He introduces his squad, the <a href=\"/corsairs/4060-46826/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46826\"> Corsairs</a>, and Emma introduces her squad, the <a href=\"/hellions/4060-3199/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3199\"> Hellions</a>. Finally, Dani tells everyone about when she was a student and she was part of a team called the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\"> New Mutants</a>. They were a family, and her kids are like one too. She introduces Prodigy, Wind Dancer, Surge, Wallflower, and Elixir, as her squad, the New Mutants!</p>",

And what will it cost them?</em></p><p>The Californian Desert: From a ridge, the former member of the Serpent Society known as Diamondback, and the mercenary Paladin look down on a facility surrounded by a fence. In the middle of no where, it seems that this facility, dubbed “Genetassist” is not meant to be spied upon by those as dubious as Diamondback and Paladin. Paladin points out that security is low, while Diamondback mocks the facilities name, for she knows that what is being designed in there is as lethal as a nuclear warhead. Diamondback asks Paladin if he knows what this would go for on the Black Market, to which he replies that he knows what it is <em>worth</em>, why else would he have taken the job.</p><p>Paladin asks Diamondback why she took this job, to which Diamondback snaps at him, exclaiming that this is none of his business, ‘You’re a gun for hire, not a shrink for hire’. Paladin smiles and comments that he heard she had reformed to win the heart of Captain America, but guesses that didn’t quite work out. Diamondback confirms that she did go legit for Cap, but what can she say? He was her heart’s desire back then, ‘But my heart grew up, you know? And we don’t always get what we want.’ Unbeknownst to Diamondback and Paladin, while they are watching Genetassist, someone else is watching them.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Los Angles, at the Keller Mansion, the Xavier Institute students known collectively as the Hellions have just been visited by the mysterious being known as the Kingmaker, who has come to grant their wishes. Sooraya “Dust” Qadir turns away from the Kingmaker, declaring that she wants nothing, so she can be counted out of the deal. ‘Everybody wants something,’ the Kingmaker says to Sooraya, reminding the Hellions that they called him, and he has told them what he can do - one wish, their hearts desire and he can make it happen.</p><p>The Kingmaker takes a flower out of a vase and remarks that for some of them, their wish is already clear to him, and turning to Kevin “Wither” Ford, he asks him if he wishes he could turn his power off, to make physical contact again. Kevin closes his eyes and turns his face to the floor, as the flower brushes up against his face, he asks the Kingmaker how he knew. The Kingmaker reminds the Hellions that they all left their names, and remarks that he does research before he takes on new clients.</p><p>The Kingmaker points out that time is money and reminds the Hellions that they all have something they want, ‘I can give it to you!’ The usually reserved Dust points out that of course he will want something in return, ‘Things like this are never free!’ The Kingmaker smiles and states that of course it is not free, ‘What kind of businessman do you take me for?’ He explains that his clients form a vast network, they help him grant the wishes, and in return theirs are helped to be granted by others, so everyone wins.</p><p>Dust declares that she is still wary, so the Kingmaker turns to leave, suggesting to the Hellions that in the future they do not waste his time with prank phone calls. Santo “Rockslide” Vaccarro asks about the rest of them, but the Kingmaker informs him that it is all or nothing, as they all called him together. Julian Keller, appropriately codenamed Hellion and the leader of the group puts a hand on Dust’s shoulder, and asks what if the Kingmaker could give them a demonstration, at no cost, just to prove he is as good as he says.</p><p>The Kingmaker smiles wickedly and announces that it is completely workable, but Sooraya is still unsure. Julian points out that it is fair, as it is only a test, with no strings attached. Sooraya narrows her eyes and remarks that so long as they can back out. ‘Excellent. Who’s first?’ asks the Kingmaker. Sooraya closes her eyes and everyone else looks around nervously, except for Rockslide, who smiles and exclaims that he has got a wish.</p><p>The next day, Rockslide is at the center of a wrestling ring, with hundreds of spectators, all watching him as he holds his opponent high above him. The commentator exclaims that it looks like Rockslide is the real deal, as he has got Strongarm helpless! Watching ringside, the Hellions flank the Kingmaker, and Julian remarks that he cannot believe this is what Santo wished for. The Kingmaker explains that this is wrestling for hyper-powered individuals, where his strength will be respected and his appearance is not viewed as outlandish.</p><p> </p><p>The Kingmaker reveals that Santo will have his shot at the title this Summer, and then he will be a legend. Cessily “Mercury” Kincaid remarks to Julian that she thought wrestling was fake, to which Julian replies that this one isn’t, as it is real street fighting for supers, not to mention it is Santa’s favorite - who knew the Kingmaker had access? Brian “Tag” Cruz informs the Kingmaker that he knows what he wants, and whispers it in his ear. The Kingmaker tells Brian that he can do better than that.</p><p> </p><p>Kevin looks at Sooraya and asks her what she thinks now, to which the level-headed Dust replies that Santo does not seem to have the troubles that they have, as she would never have wished for this, adding that she is still not sure she will wish for anything.</p><p> </p><p>Back in the ring, Strongarm leaps down at Santo, boasting that no rookie is going to beat him. Suddenly, one of Rockslide’s hands is shot-off from the rest of his body and smacks Strongarm in the face, knocking him to the floor. ‘Dude, I don’t even need my whole body to beat ya! Santo exclaims. ‘Did you see what he did?’ someone in the astonished crowd exclaims, and after three seconds, Strongarm does not tap back in, which means Santo is the winner. The crowd goes wild, and begin chanting ‘Rockslide! Rockslide! Rockslide!’ The Kingmaker smiles, and turning to the five other Hellions, asks them who is next.</p><p> </p><p>Later, in Portland, Oregon. Cessily has arrived home. A taxi pulls out of her parents driveway, but she just stands in front of the house. Suddenly, her mother and father open the door and rush over to her. ‘We’re so glad you decided to come home!’ Cessily’s father tells her, and as her mother hugs her, Cessily asks if they are okay with her being here, to which her father replies of course they are, and asks her if she is here for the rest of the Summer. Cessily’s mother smiles and tells her that she looks good, which surprises Cessily, nevertheless, she thanks her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, a neighbor calls over the fence, ‘Hey, Mark! That your daughter? Haven’t seen her in years!’ Cessily apologizes to her parents and exclaims that she doesn’t want to cause a scene, so heads inside quickly. Mark Kincaid tells his daughter not to, as it is time they faced up to this, and calls to his neighbor, Frank, asking him if he remembers his daughter, Cessily. With eyes downcast, Cessily is brought to the fence, and the slightly stunned Frank asks when it was that she turned that color. ‘Our daughter’s a mutant, Frank. There. I said it. She’s a mutant’ Mrs. Kincaid states, before adding that she hopes it won’t be a problem.</p><p> </p><p>Nervously, Frank replies that he has got no problem but has to go now. Mark grabs Cessily’s suitcase and remarks that it didn’t go as bad as he thought, as Cessily’s mother wraps and arm around her and leads them inside, suggesting that Cessily get unpacked and then they can go out and do some shopping, have some lunch, make a whole day of it. Cessily is surprised by this, and smiles, before her mother asks her about her school and friends. Mercury replies that her friends are the same, although they do have a new guy in their group who she thinks is really cool - Kevin.</p><p> </p><p>Back at the Keller Mansion, Kevin stands nervously beside the large swimming pool, while Julian and Brian lie on sun chairs wearing just their shorts. Julian asks Kevin why he has got such a long face, and suggests that he can and lounge in the sun with them. ‘Yeah, ‘cause I’m dressed to get a tan’ Kevin replies sarcastically, motioning to his well-covered body, to which Brian suggests that he could at least lose a few layers, as the chairs are plastic.</p><p> </p><p>Concerned for his teammate, Julian assures Wither that the Kingmaker will come though, as he has a good feeling about him. A courier arrives at the gate, and asks the young men if any of them are Kevin Ford. Kevin makes himself known and the courier hands him a package. Suddenly, a dog enters the yard and starts barking at the courier. Julian explains that the dog belongs to his neighbor, adding that he hates it. Examining the package, Kevin holds a jar labelled <em>Benetech Cure Mark II</em>, and exclaims that he thinks it is from the Kingmaker - it’s the cure!</p><p> </p><p>Later, Julian and Brian are waiting outside for Kevin still, so Brian calls to him, pointing out that it has been half an hour, just like the prescription said. When the neighbors dog starts barking again, Julian exclaims that it wont shut up. When Kevin emerges from the mansion in the same protective clothing he was wearing, Julian reminds him that he was supposed to change, dress into natural fibers to test it out. Kevin explains that he is scared to test it, as he doesn’t want it to fail.</p><p> </p><p>Tag points out that Wither just has to touch something alive to see what happens. ‘But not me’ remarks Hellion, as the dog starts running towards them, he exclaims ‘bad dog! This isn’t your house!’ The dog rushes to Kevin, who shouts ‘Get back! No…don’t!’ but the dog leaps onto Kevin - and starts liking his face. Julian points out that he is touching him and nothing is happening. Tag congratulates Kevin as it worked, adding that it is another wish granted.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, at the Maslak Refugee Camp in Western Afghanistan. Sooraya sits in the back of a jeep, remarking that she does not understand how this is possible. The Kingmaker replies that travel permits were easy, as was acquiring the jeep, and while information about the refugees was difficult, it was not impossible. Many refugees gather around the jeep, and motioning to another woman, also dressed in a black burka, the Kingmaker announces that he believe he has solved Sooraya’s family problem, adding that in time, he might be able to arrange for her mother to emigrate to the States.</p><p> </p><p>Eyes-wide, Sooraya calls to her mother. The older woman lowers her face covering, surprised to see her daughter. Sooraya hugs her mother and tells the Kingmaker that she doesn’t know how to thank him. Getting back into the jeep, the Kingmaker tells her not to worry, as she will soon now.</p><p> </p><p>Back in California, this time in Hollywood, Julian and Brian are on an outing, and Julian mutters that he wants to know when it is time for their wishes to be granted, before informing Brian that Cessily called to say her parents are suddenly all over her, proud to show her off, and adds that Kevin is losing the whole “goth thing”, not to mention Santo has a big fight coming up, and the last he heard, Sooraya was being taken to see her mother. ‘What about us?!’</p><p> </p><p>Brian ignores Hellion’s complaining and simply asks him what he wished for. ‘Fortune and glory, man’, claiming that they are the “basics”, before asking Tag what he wished for, adding that he heard the Kingmaker comment that his wish sucked. Tag repliers that he changed his, that it is no big deal. Julian motions to someone getting out of a limo who is suddenly surrounded by reporters, cameras and other people. He smiles and says again that fortune and glory are the way to go.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Tag turns their attention to the rooftop, where a sniper is aiming his weapon at the Governor. Hellion flies up, telling Tag to warn the Governor, while he deals to this. Using his formidable telekinesis, Julian creates a force field, blocking the bullets entry. ‘Uh-uh, pal’ Hellion exclaims, before asking the sniper if he doesn’t like the Governor, and suggesting that this is a little much. Julian uses his telekinesis to push the sniper off the rooftop, but once separated from his rifle, Julian catches him on a telekinetic platform, telling him that he is not going to fall to his death, but go to jail.</p><p> </p><p>The Governor’s bodyguard ushers the Governor away, as a crowd of people point to the sky, one of them asking who it is up there. Hellion hovers above them, introducing himself and telling everyone not to worry, as he is on the job. ‘That’s right, H-E-L-L-I-O-N’, Julian remarks with a smile. One reporter asks him where he is from, as another asks if he is a mutant. Suddenly Brian steps forward and tells the reporters that there will be one question at a time, and points to a young woman who he seems to recognize, ‘Miss…Maltin, isn’t it?’</p><p> </p><p>The reporter smiles as she asks Hellion how he knew the Governor was in trouble. The cocky Julian replies that he is a local boy and was just showing a friend his wonderful town, when he just happened to look up, adding that if he weren’t traveling a tourist, he may never have seen the sniper. Tag asks Miss Maltin if she has a follow up, to which she points out that Hellion is not a typical super hero in costume and mask, and asks if he is just an average citizen helping out. Julian smiles and reveals that he is name is Julian Keller, adding that he has no secrets and explaining that he is a Los Angeleno born and bred, and that he wanted to just chip in.</p><p> </p><p>Soon, the interviews have finished, and Julian and Brian make their way along the street. Out of earshot, Julian asks Brian what happened back there ‘You were all over that!’ Tag reveals that the Kingmaker wanted him to make sure that Julian’s big debut went well, to which Julian asks Tag if he knew about it. Rounding a corner, Tag replies that he did and that the Kingmaker wanted Julian to look good, which is why he let Jennifer Maltin get the first couple of questions.</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer Maltin is waiting for the Julian, and Tag takes his leave, informing Julian that he will see him back home. Julian thanks Jennifer and tells her that she made it real easy for him. ‘Better than those pesky “Are you a mutant” questions, right?’ asks Jennifer, before telling Julian not to worry, for while he will have to answer those questions, now that everyone likes him, it should be much easier.</p><p> </p><p>Julian grins and says ‘Counting on a one-on-one interview, aren’t you?’ Jennifer smirks and tells Julian not to flatter himself, for while the Kingmaker wants him to be a star, she will make him a star, but as to how much they enjoy the process, that is up to them. Hands in his pockets as they walk side by side, Julian asks Jennifer if she works with the Kingmaker too. Jennifer reveals that she does, and declares that signing with him was the best decision she ever made. ‘Can you say Pulitzer Prize? I can. Thanks to him’. Julian tells Jennifer that she doesn’t need to sell him on it, for so far, he is loving this deal.</p><p> </p><p>Back in Afghanistan, Sooraya and her mother are spending time together, sheltered in a tent. Mrs. Qadir points out that her daughter is wearing her burka, and asks if she wears it in America. Sooraya informs her mother that she never wore it because of the Taliban, but because she likes the modesty and protection it affords her from the eyes of men. Mrs. Qadir smiles and tells Sooraya that it is good she is in a country where she has that choice, for here, things are better, but not all the time, and not everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Sooraya and her mother clasp hands, and with a twinkle in her eye, Sooraya informs her mother that the man who brought her here says he can help her come to America so they can be together, and asks her mother if this is something she would like. A tear falls down Mrs. Qadir’s face as she states she would love this, before asking Sooraya what it is she has to do for this man to make it possible. Sooraya smiles as she admits that she doesn’t know, before exclaiming that she now thinks it doesn’t matter what she has to do.</p><p> </p><p>Back in Los Angles at the Keller Mansion, Tag is on the phone, telling someone that Strongarm was a joke, that Rockslide needs real action. He states that he wants Rockslide against someone who matters, or else he is going to pull him out. ‘You better believe you’re gonna call me back!’ Tag shouts down the phone, and after hanging up, Santo asks him if he is sure that is going to work. Brian tells Santo to trust him, adding that the Kingmaker told him to pull out al the stops, and even gave him a look at his rolodex.</p><p> </p><p>Tag says that it is all about who you know, a “you scratch my back, I scratch yours”. Santo agrees, so long as he is known as the strongest man in the world, Brian can scratch whatever he wants. Hellion suddenly enters the room, telling his friends that his parents house has tons of cool places to hang out, and his father’s study isn’t one of them. Brian declares that he is doing business, to which Hellion smiles, before thanking Tag for hooking him up with Jennifer Maltin, ‘She’s pretty hot!’</p><p> </p><p>Brian tells Julian that he is always there for him, and that he is glad he came by, as they need to talk. ‘Have a seat’. Tag declares that today was big, that Julian captured the hearts of the media, to them, he is a hero, but that they cannot waste time, as time is money - and they have to capitalize. Julian replies that he likes the sound of that, and asks Tag what he is thinking of. Brian sits down at the desk and puts his feet up, explaining that as Julian is a public hero, they will get him on the talk show circuit, some magazine spreads, while more importantly, being public means Julian can do advertising eventually.</p><p> </p><p>Tag tells Julian that they will take care of the rest - fortune and glory. Hellion smiles and tells Tag that it is amazing, before asking him if he really thinks he can do magazines and advertising. Brian points out that there will need to be a few more heroic deeds, but with the Kingmaker’s connections, then yes. ‘It’s a scratch-your-back thing’ Santo offers. Julian tells Tag that he is ‘so the man’, before admitting that he doesn’t understand why Brian is doing all of this for him and Santo - what about his own wish? What did you wish for?</p><p> </p><p>Tag grins and reminds his friends that the Kingmaker had six wishes to grant to them, so he figured he might be able to chip in, explaining that his power to make people “It”, well, the Kingmaker is teaching him how to really make people “It”, so he is using the Kingmaker’s connections to put both Julian and Santo on the map. Julian asks Tag if that was his wish - as it sounds like the Kingmaker’s wish! Julian tells Tag he is crazy, but whatever makes him happy. Santo smiles and declares that calling the Kingmaker was the best thing the Hellions ever did!</p><p> </p><p>Back at the Kincaid household, Cessily and her father are playing a board game and her mother watches. Cessily points out that it is her father’s turn, to which Mark Kincaid jokes that Cessily is clearly anxious to beat her old man. Cessily’s mother asks her family what they would like for dinner, to which Cessily suggests they could order Chinese food. Mark agrees that is an excellent idea, when suddenly, there is a knock at the door.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Kincaid smiles and announces that she will get it, when a well-dressed man enters the house, apologizing for disturbing them, he informs Cessily that the Kingmaker needs to see her back in L.A. as soon as possible. Mercury replies that she doesn’t understand, to which the Kingmaker’s agent informs her that the trial run is over.</p><p> </p><p>In Afghanistan, Sooraya is informed that it is time for her to return to the United States, so she and her mother hug farewell.</p><p> </p><p>Lying around on the grass wearing shorts and a t-shirt, a smiling Kevin suddenly frowns, as another agent informs Wither that the Kingmaker wants to see him.</p><p> </p><p>In his dressing room, Rockslide looks at himself in the mirror, until Tag enters and informs him that the Big Man wants him. ‘I thought I was the Big Man’ Santo replies.</p><p> </p><p>Hellion has tied some thief up at the police station and a gathering of reporters and camera people surround him, ‘All part of the friendly service!’ Hellion exclaims. However, behind him is the Kingmaker, who congratulates Julian on making the most of this - before informing him that it is time to go.</p><p> </p><p>Inside his office, the Kingmaker informs Julian that all of his friends are here, and motions him towards a conference room, adding that he will be with him shortly, as he has an important call coming in.</p><p> </p><p>Julian enters the conference room and asks Sooraya if she found her mother. Dust replies that she did and exclaims that it was wonderful. Cessily points out that Kevin is wearing shorts, to which Kevin replies it is cool. Across the table, Tag informs an eager Santo that the Champ’s is a real possibility within a month.</p><p> </p><p>In his office, the Kingmaker turns on a screen, where he is greeted by Dr. Otto Octavius - a.k.a. Dr. Octopus - on the other side. The Kingmaker asks Octavius how he may help him, to which the Spider-Man villain exclaims that he hears Genetassist has almost completed their research. The Kingmaker replies that they have, and that word has already spread - everyone is going after this and Genetassist is unprepared. Dr. Octopus snaps that he doesn’t care who else wants it, he wants it. A sombre Kingmaker looks through one-way-glass into the conference room, at the Hellions, and declares that whatever Doctor Octopus wants, he gets - ‘And I have the perfect team for the job!’</p>",

At the same time, Flash and Harry make an awkward attempt at revisiting a time when they were the best of friends.</i></p><p>Mary Jane is trying on her Homecoming dress in the mall as a flaming pumpkin head shoots toward her. The projectile is stopped inches in front of her face by Spider-Man, who is fighting the Green Goblin in that very clothing store. Spidey stops the Green Goblin and tells MJ that he changed his mind about going to Homecoming with her, but instead of being thrilled, MJ tells him that she's going with her dream guy - Harry Osborn.</p><p>In a flash, Harry appears in a field of flowers, wearing a snappy suit. MJ steps into his embrace, and the two are about to kiss when Mary Jane's daydream is interrupted by her teacher. MJ and Harry, who was also sleeping, are told off for not paying attention.</p><p>Later, at the Coffee Bean, Harry and MJ discuss school. Harry reveals that his dad forbade him from going to Homecoming until he gets his act together and gets better grades. MJ is concerned, and tells Harry that they'll have to make sure he aces the next Physics test so that they can go.</p><p>Later, at home, MJ tries to call Liz. Liz has been avoiding her and not taking her calls, and MJ is worried about her friend.</p><p>At the library, Peter Parker tries to tutor Harry in physics. Harry just can't understand, and gets extremely frustrated. Harry offers Peter $100 to help him cheat on the test and Peter is so shocked that he leaves. He runs into MJ on the way out, and she consoles him, telling him that he can't expect to help everyone with everything.</p><p>MJ decides to tutor Harry, and tells him that she'll quiz him and give him a kiss for every answer he gets right. However, they both end up making out in the stacks and not studying at all, and decide that it isn't going to work out.</p><p>In class the next day, the two get caught passing notes and get detention. Harry reveals that he's happy about detention because the teacher keeps the Physics test on her desk. He asks MJ to help him cheat and get a glimpse of the test, but MJ has doubts.</p><p>Flash finds MJ at her locker, and he complains about Liz. Liz has been treating Flash even worse lately, and Flash is confused as to what has set the girl off. MJ decides to confront Liz, and finds her in a lecture hall. Liz tries to avoid MJ, but the two start talking. MJ tells Liz how Harry wants her to cheat, and Liz gets extremely angry, saying that she hates cheaters and that \"cheaters are the scum of the Earth. They're selfish jerks who take great pleasure in hurting their friends' feelings\" and stomps off. Although MJ doesn't know it, Liz is referring to the time she caught Mary Jane and Flash hugging after the football game.</p><p>At detention, Harry tries everything to get the teacher out of the room so he can see the test. Finally the teacher is called into the office to get some roses from her husband, but MJ intervenes at the last minute and says that she'll go get it. After detention, Harry is extremely angry that she ruined his chances and breaks up with her.</p>",

The building's surveillance system identifies the presence of Bruce Wayne in the building. As Riddler completes the transfer of the computer files onto a removable disk, the security system informes the villains that Wayne has stopped outside their door. However, when the door opens, Batman greets the villains instead.</p><p>Riddler and his men dash from the building into a van; Batman follows in the Batmobile. He receives a call from Red Tornado, informing him that Aquaman is still missing. Batman stops Riddler's van and pursues him to a club called the Batcave. The two trade blows before the villain's associates grab Batman. However, in a bar named for Batman, he has many allies. The Riddler unleashes a torrent of light and question marks and escapes; Batman gathers a few clues, and leaves.</p><p>Elsewhere Jonathan Crane (aka the Scarecrow) is seen administering an injection to a sickly girl, who miraculously walks again. Flash runs to a desert which has been revitalized. The inhabitants inform him that a man arrived with a gun that first made ice, and that the ice became the sea. Flash wonders what Captain Cold could be up to. Elsewhere, Poison Ivy commands a huge stalk to grow, providing an entire city with much-needed food.</p><p>Batman trails Riddler to the cemetery, armed with heat goggles that make him immune to Riddler's hologram technology. He attacks Riddler again, finally besting the villain and demanding the disk. As Batman holds him, the Riddler begins to strangle himself. Finally, he releases his grip and asks what's wrong with him. Back in the Batcave, Batman tells Alfred that he is very concerned that the Riddler had his hands on the disk's information. In Arkham, Riddler interacts with the Joker, who has heard about the apocalyptic dreams the others are having, and he wants to be involved in the grand scheme.</p><p>Elsewhere, Aquaman lies strapped to a table; he is to be subject to experiments. Brainiac appears bearing a scalpel, informing Aquaman that he wants to get inside his head.</p>",

Afterwards, Jubilee goes back to her friend, Meg, who gets bugged by the other kids. They even joke about Jubilee being a mutant and sadistically ask her if she’s going to kill them with her powers. Jubilee, not bothered by it, jokingly responds back that’s not such a bad idea. The kids leave her be from now on. Later, Jubilee gets approached by Dale, who wants to know more about her mutant powers. Jubilee explains to him what her powers are. Later, Dale tells Jubilee that he and Missy broke up. Time passes, and Jubilee meets up with Meg and tells her all this. Jubilee thinks that Dale wants to ask her out, but fears that he’ll only do it to maintain his popularity. After spending some free time with Meg at the mall, Jubilee takes a cab back home to her Aunt Lee. In front of the house, she is surprised by her aunt, who doesn’t want Jubilee taking cabs anymore and instead has bought her a scooter! Next day at school, Jubilee talks to Dale again, wanting to ask him out. Dale stops her, telling Jubilee that he is back with Missy. At gym, Jubilee talks to Meg about this, who seems to be distracted by the other kids making fun of her. Jubilee notices and tells Meg not to let those kids get to her. Jubilee says that she has to do the same thing with all the mutant haters calling her “mutie” constantly. Meg understands. At the end of the school day, Jubilee goes back to Judy’s office. Judy congratulates Jubilee about her conversation with Meg, who puts everything into perspective now. Judy knows that Jubilee is finally getting the hang of counseling. Later that night, when Jubilee is back home, she finds her aunt and the butler coming back home. Hope is badly injured after her “business meeting” and has to sleep it off. Jubilee doesn’t seem to be bothered by it and simply walks back to her room.</p>",

            "description": "<em>Overview</em>  For more than ten years, pop culture cultists have revered and adored a mysterious, brooding thirteen-year-old girl named Emily the Strange. Nobody knows much about the young girl with a porcelain face and huge eyes framed by black bangs, and her ever-present brood of black cats only adds to the intrigue-but that hasn't stopped a generation of rabid fans from letting Emily put her spell upon them. Now Emily fans are invited into her odd, mysterious world-a place where kitty friends talk, the ghosts of famous weirdos come out to play, reality is never quite what it seems, and-above all-a place where anyone who's ever been considered a little \"strange\" themselves will be made to feel right at home. <br /><br />Dark Horse Comics and the creative minds behind Cosmic Debris are thrilled to present the second issue of <em>Emily</em>, with all-new stories and art. Each issue of<em>Emily</em> comics features 48 pages of black, white, and red art (with the occasional outburst of full-color freakouts!), illustrating a wacky range of Emily stories. <br /><br />• Emily the Strange is the star of a best-selling line of merchandise and fashion accessories from the creative brain trust known as Cosmic Debris. Visit www.Emilystrange.com.<br /><br /><strong>• </strong>Also included in this issue is a bonus Emily fold-out poster highlighting the theme of this issue and showing what Emily does best - \"get lost”!",

Writer Steve Englehart and artists Marshall Rogers &amp; Terry Austin set a high standard with their acclaimed run on DETECTIVE COMICS in the late 1970s! Now that team is back with BATMAN: DARK DETECTIVE, a miniseries that pits the Dark Knight against the most famous and feared members of his Rogues Gallery! In the startling debut issue, the Joker enters a gubernatorial election using the campain slogan \"Vote for me or I'll kill you!\" Will it persuade voters? Plus, Bruce Wayne's old love interest Silver St. Cloud returns, as do Two-Face and the Scarecrow! And the action continues in the startling second issue, as the Scarecrow manages to overcome Batman in the one location where he's most vulnerable: the Batcave! Meanwhile, the Bruce Wayne/Silver St. Cloud relationship heats up! Issue #1.</em><br /><br />Joker found Two-Face waiting for him at his hideout. The former District Attorney warned him not to run for governor.<br />After seeing Evan off to one of his events, Silver visited Wayne Manor. After they agreed on friendship, Bruce insisted on showing her the cave beneath the house. While inside, he believed Joe Chill and several of his enemies were in the cave, then realized he'd been attacked by the Scarecrow (possibly as a policeman the night before - time released fear gas). When he'd overcome it, he and Silver admitted their love for each other. They gave into their passion as the Joker killed the first victim who didn't pay his demands.<br />Commissioner Akin wondered about Batman.",

            "description": "<p><i>The first episode of V.2 recounts the story of Aaron Gawain, a werewolf. At the age of sixteen, Aaron is rescued from his alcoholic, abusive father by a strange gentleman named Nebiros and taken to his castle to live with him. Though treated with kindness and care, Aaron is virtually a prisoner at the castle which is guarded by a horde of she-wolves at all times. As time passes, Aaron develops a feeling of love towards his captor. One day in Nebiros' absence, however, a jealous she-wolf tricks Aaron out of the castle, and attacks him. Nebiros appears just in time to save Aaron's life, but abandons him forever for his betrayal. Bitten by the she-wolf, Aaron, too, is now doomed to the fate of a werewolf: he turns into a wolf on the fifteenth of each month and roams around the city killing everyone in sight. Aaron decides to work at the Tarot Cafe as an assistant while looking for the solution to his problem. In the next episode, we learn more about our main character, Pamela. Pamela was born more than 700 years ago in Scotland. Her mother, a gifted medicine woman and a tarot card reader herself, foresees that Pamela's ability to predict future will jeopardize her life, and makes a pact with the devil who promises eternal life for Pamela. Soon thereafter, Pamela's mother is accused of witchcraft and burned at the stakes, but young Pamela's life is spared. Abandoned in the forest where she must fend for herself, Pamela meets Ash, her future lover, mentor and protector...700 years later, in the present day, Pamela encounters reincarnated Ash, being pursued by a gang of thugs. The thugs, who call themselves Albigensian Crusaders, eventually kidnap Pamela and Ash and subject them to a secret witch trial. Pamela and Ash are saved from certain death by Pamela's friend Belous...</i></p>",
