            "description": "<p><em>The Hellions are faced with the ultimate temptation: one wish each, a whole new life. What will they wish for? And what will it cost them?</em></p><p>The Californian Desert: From a ridge, the former member of the Serpent Society known as Diamondback, and the mercenary Paladin look down on a facility surrounded by a fence. In the middle of no where, it seems that this facility, dubbed “Genetassist” is not meant to be spied upon by those as dubious as Diamondback and Paladin. Paladin points out that security is low, while Diamondback mocks the facilities name, for she knows that what is being designed in there is as lethal as a nuclear warhead. Diamondback asks Paladin if he knows what this would go for on the Black Market, to which he replies that he knows what it is <em>worth</em>, why else would he have taken the job.</p><p>Paladin asks Diamondback why she took this job, to which Diamondback snaps at him, exclaiming that this is none of his business, ‘You’re a gun for hire, not a shrink for hire’. Paladin smiles and comments that he heard she had reformed to win the heart of Captain America, but guesses that didn’t quite work out. Diamondback confirms that she did go legit for Cap, but what can she say? He was her heart’s desire back then, ‘But my heart grew up, you know? And we don’t always get what we want.’ Unbeknownst to Diamondback and Paladin, while they are watching Genetassist, someone else is watching them.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Los Angles, at the Keller Mansion, the Xavier Institute students known collectively as the Hellions have just been visited by the mysterious being known as the Kingmaker, who has come to grant their wishes. Sooraya “Dust” Qadir turns away from the Kingmaker, declaring that she wants nothing, so she can be counted out of the deal. ‘Everybody wants something,’ the Kingmaker says to Sooraya, reminding the Hellions that they called him, and he has told them what he can do - one wish, their hearts desire and he can make it happen.</p><p>The Kingmaker takes a flower out of a vase and remarks that for some of them, their wish is already clear to him, and turning to Kevin “Wither” Ford, he asks him if he wishes he could turn his power off, to make physical contact again. Kevin closes his eyes and turns his face to the floor, as the flower brushes up against his face, he asks the Kingmaker how he knew. The Kingmaker reminds the Hellions that they all left their names, and remarks that he does research before he takes on new clients.</p><p>The Kingmaker points out that time is money and reminds the Hellions that they all have something they want, ‘I can give it to you!’ The usually reserved Dust points out that of course he will want something in return, ‘Things like this are never free!’ The Kingmaker smiles and states that of course it is not free, ‘What kind of businessman do you take me for?’ He explains that his clients form a vast network, they help him grant the wishes, and in return theirs are helped to be granted by others, so everyone wins.</p><p>Dust declares that she is still wary, so the Kingmaker turns to leave, suggesting to the Hellions that in the future they do not waste his time with prank phone calls. Santo “Rockslide” Vaccarro asks about the rest of them, but the Kingmaker informs him that it is all or nothing, as they all called him together. Julian Keller, appropriately codenamed Hellion and the leader of the group puts a hand on Dust’s shoulder, and asks what if the Kingmaker could give them a demonstration, at no cost, just to prove he is as good as he says.</p><p>The Kingmaker smiles wickedly and announces that it is completely workable, but Sooraya is still unsure. Julian points out that it is fair, as it is only a test, with no strings attached. Sooraya narrows her eyes and remarks that so long as they can back out. ‘Excellent. Who’s first?’ asks the Kingmaker. Sooraya closes her eyes and everyone else looks around nervously, except for Rockslide, who smiles and exclaims that he has got a wish.</p><p>The next day, Rockslide is at the center of a wrestling ring, with hundreds of spectators, all watching him as he holds his opponent high above him. The commentator exclaims that it looks like Rockslide is the real deal, as he has got Strongarm helpless! Watching ringside, the Hellions flank the Kingmaker, and Julian remarks that he cannot believe this is what Santo wished for. The Kingmaker explains that this is wrestling for hyper-powered individuals, where his strength will be respected and his appearance is not viewed as outlandish.</p><p> </p><p>The Kingmaker reveals that Santo will have his shot at the title this Summer, and then he will be a legend. Cessily “Mercury” Kincaid remarks to Julian that she thought wrestling was fake, to which Julian replies that this one isn’t, as it is real street fighting for supers, not to mention it is Santa’s favorite - who knew the Kingmaker had access? Brian “Tag” Cruz informs the Kingmaker that he knows what he wants, and whispers it in his ear. The Kingmaker tells Brian that he can do better than that.</p><p> </p><p>Kevin looks at Sooraya and asks her what she thinks now, to which the level-headed Dust replies that Santo does not seem to have the troubles that they have, as she would never have wished for this, adding that she is still not sure she will wish for anything.</p><p> </p><p>Back in the ring, Strongarm leaps down at Santo, boasting that no rookie is going to beat him. Suddenly, one of Rockslide’s hands is shot-off from the rest of his body and smacks Strongarm in the face, knocking him to the floor. ‘Dude, I don’t even need my whole body to beat ya! Santo exclaims. ‘Did you see what he did?’ someone in the astonished crowd exclaims, and after three seconds, Strongarm does not tap back in, which means Santo is the winner. The crowd goes wild, and begin chanting ‘Rockslide! Rockslide! Rockslide!’ The Kingmaker smiles, and turning to the five other Hellions, asks them who is next.</p><p> </p><p>Later, in Portland, Oregon. Cessily has arrived home. A taxi pulls out of her parents driveway, but she just stands in front of the house. Suddenly, her mother and father open the door and rush over to her. ‘We’re so glad you decided to come home!’ Cessily’s father tells her, and as her mother hugs her, Cessily asks if they are okay with her being here, to which her father replies of course they are, and asks her if she is here for the rest of the Summer. Cessily’s mother smiles and tells her that she looks good, which surprises Cessily, nevertheless, she thanks her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, a neighbor calls over the fence, ‘Hey, Mark! That your daughter? Haven’t seen her in years!’ Cessily apologizes to her parents and exclaims that she doesn’t want to cause a scene, so heads inside quickly. Mark Kincaid tells his daughter not to, as it is time they faced up to this, and calls to his neighbor, Frank, asking him if he remembers his daughter, Cessily. With eyes downcast, Cessily is brought to the fence, and the slightly stunned Frank asks when it was that she turned that color. ‘Our daughter’s a mutant, Frank. There. I said it. She’s a mutant’ Mrs. Kincaid states, before adding that she hopes it won’t be a problem.</p><p> </p><p>Nervously, Frank replies that he has got no problem but has to go now. Mark grabs Cessily’s suitcase and remarks that it didn’t go as bad as he thought, as Cessily’s mother wraps and arm around her and leads them inside, suggesting that Cessily get unpacked and then they can go out and do some shopping, have some lunch, make a whole day of it. Cessily is surprised by this, and smiles, before her mother asks her about her school and friends. Mercury replies that her friends are the same, although they do have a new guy in their group who she thinks is really cool - Kevin.</p><p> </p><p>Back at the Keller Mansion, Kevin stands nervously beside the large swimming pool, while Julian and Brian lie on sun chairs wearing just their shorts. Julian asks Kevin why he has got such a long face, and suggests that he can and lounge in the sun with them. ‘Yeah, ‘cause I’m dressed to get a tan’ Kevin replies sarcastically, motioning to his well-covered body, to which Brian suggests that he could at least lose a few layers, as the chairs are plastic.</p><p> </p><p>Concerned for his teammate, Julian assures Wither that the Kingmaker will come though, as he has a good feeling about him. A courier arrives at the gate, and asks the young men if any of them are Kevin Ford. Kevin makes himself known and the courier hands him a package. Suddenly, a dog enters the yard and starts barking at the courier. Julian explains that the dog belongs to his neighbor, adding that he hates it. Examining the package, Kevin holds a jar labelled <em>Benetech Cure Mark II</em>, and exclaims that he thinks it is from the Kingmaker - it’s the cure!</p><p> </p><p>Later, Julian and Brian are waiting outside for Kevin still, so Brian calls to him, pointing out that it has been half an hour, just like the prescription said. When the neighbors dog starts barking again, Julian exclaims that it wont shut up. When Kevin emerges from the mansion in the same protective clothing he was wearing, Julian reminds him that he was supposed to change, dress into natural fibers to test it out. Kevin explains that he is scared to test it, as he doesn’t want it to fail.</p><p> </p><p>Tag points out that Wither just has to touch something alive to see what happens. ‘But not me’ remarks Hellion, as the dog starts running towards them, he exclaims ‘bad dog! This isn’t your house!’ The dog rushes to Kevin, who shouts ‘Get back! No…don’t!’ but the dog leaps onto Kevin - and starts liking his face. Julian points out that he is touching him and nothing is happening. Tag congratulates Kevin as it worked, adding that it is another wish granted.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, at the Maslak Refugee Camp in Western Afghanistan. Sooraya sits in the back of a jeep, remarking that she does not understand how this is possible. The Kingmaker replies that travel permits were easy, as was acquiring the jeep, and while information about the refugees was difficult, it was not impossible. Many refugees gather around the jeep, and motioning to another woman, also dressed in a black burka, the Kingmaker announces that he believe he has solved Sooraya’s family problem, adding that in time, he might be able to arrange for her mother to emigrate to the States.</p><p> </p><p>Eyes-wide, Sooraya calls to her mother. The older woman lowers her face covering, surprised to see her daughter. Sooraya hugs her mother and tells the Kingmaker that she doesn’t know how to thank him. Getting back into the jeep, the Kingmaker tells her not to worry, as she will soon now.</p><p> </p><p>Back in California, this time in Hollywood, Julian and Brian are on an outing, and Julian mutters that he wants to know when it is time for their wishes to be granted, before informing Brian that Cessily called to say her parents are suddenly all over her, proud to show her off, and adds that Kevin is losing the whole “goth thing”, not to mention Santo has a big fight coming up, and the last he heard, Sooraya was being taken to see her mother. ‘What about us?!’</p><p> </p><p>Brian ignores Hellion’s complaining and simply asks him what he wished for. ‘Fortune and glory, man’, claiming that they are the “basics”, before asking Tag what he wished for, adding that he heard the Kingmaker comment that his wish sucked. Tag repliers that he changed his, that it is no big deal. Julian motions to someone getting out of a limo who is suddenly surrounded by reporters, cameras and other people. He smiles and says again that fortune and glory are the way to go.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Tag turns their attention to the rooftop, where a sniper is aiming his weapon at the Governor. Hellion flies up, telling Tag to warn the Governor, while he deals to this. Using his formidable telekinesis, Julian creates a force field, blocking the bullets entry. ‘Uh-uh, pal’ Hellion exclaims, before asking the sniper if he doesn’t like the Governor, and suggesting that this is a little much. Julian uses his telekinesis to push the sniper off the rooftop, but once separated from his rifle, Julian catches him on a telekinetic platform, telling him that he is not going to fall to his death, but go to jail.</p><p> </p><p>The Governor’s bodyguard ushers the Governor away, as a crowd of people point to the sky, one of them asking who it is up there. Hellion hovers above them, introducing himself and telling everyone not to worry, as he is on the job. ‘That’s right, H-E-L-L-I-O-N’, Julian remarks with a smile. One reporter asks him where he is from, as another asks if he is a mutant. Suddenly Brian steps forward and tells the reporters that there will be one question at a time, and points to a young woman who he seems to recognize, ‘Miss…Maltin, isn’t it?’</p><p> </p><p>The reporter smiles as she asks Hellion how he knew the Governor was in trouble. The cocky Julian replies that he is a local boy and was just showing a friend his wonderful town, when he just happened to look up, adding that if he weren’t traveling a tourist, he may never have seen the sniper. Tag asks Miss Maltin if she has a follow up, to which she points out that Hellion is not a typical super hero in costume and mask, and asks if he is just an average citizen helping out. Julian smiles and reveals that he is name is Julian Keller, adding that he has no secrets and explaining that he is a Los Angeleno born and bred, and that he wanted to just chip in.</p><p> </p><p>Soon, the interviews have finished, and Julian and Brian make their way along the street. Out of earshot, Julian asks Brian what happened back there ‘You were all over that!’ Tag reveals that the Kingmaker wanted him to make sure that Julian’s big debut went well, to which Julian asks Tag if he knew about it. Rounding a corner, Tag replies that he did and that the Kingmaker wanted Julian to look good, which is why he let Jennifer Maltin get the first couple of questions.</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer Maltin is waiting for the Julian, and Tag takes his leave, informing Julian that he will see him back home. Julian thanks Jennifer and tells her that she made it real easy for him. ‘Better than those pesky “Are you a mutant” questions, right?’ asks Jennifer, before telling Julian not to worry, for while he will have to answer those questions, now that everyone likes him, it should be much easier.</p><p> </p><p>Julian grins and says ‘Counting on a one-on-one interview, aren’t you?’ Jennifer smirks and tells Julian not to flatter himself, for while the Kingmaker wants him to be a star, she will make him a star, but as to how much they enjoy the process, that is up to them. Hands in his pockets as they walk side by side, Julian asks Jennifer if she works with the Kingmaker too. Jennifer reveals that she does, and declares that signing with him was the best decision she ever made. ‘Can you say Pulitzer Prize? I can. Thanks to him’. Julian tells Jennifer that she doesn’t need to sell him on it, for so far, he is loving this deal.</p><p> </p><p>Back in Afghanistan, Sooraya and her mother are spending time together, sheltered in a tent. Mrs. Qadir points out that her daughter is wearing her burka, and asks if she wears it in America. Sooraya informs her mother that she never wore it because of the Taliban, but because she likes the modesty and protection it affords her from the eyes of men. Mrs. Qadir smiles and tells Sooraya that it is good she is in a country where she has that choice, for here, things are better, but not all the time, and not everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Sooraya and her mother clasp hands, and with a twinkle in her eye, Sooraya informs her mother that the man who brought her here says he can help her come to America so they can be together, and asks her mother if this is something she would like. A tear falls down Mrs. Qadir’s face as she states she would love this, before asking Sooraya what it is she has to do for this man to make it possible. Sooraya smiles as she admits that she doesn’t know, before exclaiming that she now thinks it doesn’t matter what she has to do.</p><p> </p><p>Back in Los Angles at the Keller Mansion, Tag is on the phone, telling someone that Strongarm was a joke, that Rockslide needs real action. He states that he wants Rockslide against someone who matters, or else he is going to pull him out. ‘You better believe you’re gonna call me back!’ Tag shouts down the phone, and after hanging up, Santo asks him if he is sure that is going to work. Brian tells Santo to trust him, adding that the Kingmaker told him to pull out al the stops, and even gave him a look at his rolodex.</p><p> </p><p>Tag says that it is all about who you know, a “you scratch my back, I scratch yours”. Santo agrees, so long as he is known as the strongest man in the world, Brian can scratch whatever he wants. Hellion suddenly enters the room, telling his friends that his parents house has tons of cool places to hang out, and his father’s study isn’t one of them. Brian declares that he is doing business, to which Hellion smiles, before thanking Tag for hooking him up with Jennifer Maltin, ‘She’s pretty hot!’</p><p> </p><p>Brian tells Julian that he is always there for him, and that he is glad he came by, as they need to talk. ‘Have a seat’. Tag declares that today was big, that Julian captured the hearts of the media, to them, he is a hero, but that they cannot waste time, as time is money - and they have to capitalize. Julian replies that he likes the sound of that, and asks Tag what he is thinking of. Brian sits down at the desk and puts his feet up, explaining that as Julian is a public hero, they will get him on the talk show circuit, some magazine spreads, while more importantly, being public means Julian can do advertising eventually.</p><p> </p><p>Tag tells Julian that they will take care of the rest - fortune and glory. Hellion smiles and tells Tag that it is amazing, before asking him if he really thinks he can do magazines and advertising. Brian points out that there will need to be a few more heroic deeds, but with the Kingmaker’s connections, then yes. ‘It’s a scratch-your-back thing’ Santo offers. Julian tells Tag that he is ‘so the man’, before admitting that he doesn’t understand why Brian is doing all of this for him and Santo - what about his own wish? What did you wish for?</p><p> </p><p>Tag grins and reminds his friends that the Kingmaker had six wishes to grant to them, so he figured he might be able to chip in, explaining that his power to make people “It”, well, the Kingmaker is teaching him how to really make people “It”, so he is using the Kingmaker’s connections to put both Julian and Santo on the map. Julian asks Tag if that was his wish - as it sounds like the Kingmaker’s wish! Julian tells Tag he is crazy, but whatever makes him happy. Santo smiles and declares that calling the Kingmaker was the best thing the Hellions ever did!</p><p> </p><p>Back at the Kincaid household, Cessily and her father are playing a board game and her mother watches. Cessily points out that it is her father’s turn, to which Mark Kincaid jokes that Cessily is clearly anxious to beat her old man. Cessily’s mother asks her family what they would like for dinner, to which Cessily suggests they could order Chinese food.

At the same time, Flash and Harry make an awkward attempt at revisiting a time when they were the best of friends.</i></p><p>Mary Jane is trying on her Homecoming dress in the mall as a flaming pumpkin head shoots toward her. The projectile is stopped inches in front of her face by Spider-Man, who is fighting the Green Goblin in that very clothing store. Spidey stops the Green Goblin and tells MJ that he changed his mind about going to Homecoming with her, but instead of being thrilled, MJ tells him that she's going with her dream guy - Harry Osborn.</p><p>In a flash, Harry appears in a field of flowers, wearing a snappy suit. MJ steps into his embrace, and the two are about to kiss when Mary Jane's daydream is interrupted by her teacher. MJ and Harry, who was also sleeping, are told off for not paying attention.</p><p>Later, at the Coffee Bean, Harry and MJ discuss school. Harry reveals that his dad forbade him from going to Homecoming until he gets his act together and gets better grades. MJ is concerned, and tells Harry that they'll have to make sure he aces the next Physics test so that they can go.</p><p>Later, at home, MJ tries to call Liz. Liz has been avoiding her and not taking her calls, and MJ is worried about her friend.</p><p>At the library, Peter Parker tries to tutor Harry in physics. Harry just can't understand, and gets extremely frustrated. Harry offers Peter $100 to help him cheat on the test and Peter is so shocked that he leaves. He runs into MJ on the way out, and she consoles him, telling him that he can't expect to help everyone with everything.</p><p>MJ decides to tutor Harry, and tells him that she'll quiz him and give him a kiss for every answer he gets right. However, they both end up making out in the stacks and not studying at all, and decide that it isn't going to work out.</p><p>In class the next day, the two get caught passing notes and get detention. Harry reveals that he's happy about detention because the teacher keeps the Physics test on her desk. He asks MJ to help him cheat and get a glimpse of the test, but MJ has doubts.</p><p>Flash finds MJ at her locker, and he complains about Liz. Liz has been treating Flash even worse lately, and Flash is confused as to what has set the girl off. MJ decides to confront Liz, and finds her in a lecture hall. Liz tries to avoid MJ, but the two start talking. MJ tells Liz how Harry wants her to cheat, and Liz gets extremely angry, saying that she hates cheaters and that \"cheaters are the scum of the Earth. They're selfish jerks who take great pleasure in hurting their friends' feelings\" and stomps off. Although MJ doesn't know it, Liz is referring to the time she caught Mary Jane and Flash hugging after the football game.</p><p>At detention, Harry tries everything to get the teacher out of the room so he can see the test. Finally the teacher is called into the office to get some roses from her husband, but MJ intervenes at the last minute and says that she'll go get it. After detention, Harry is extremely angry that she ruined his chances and breaks up with her.</p>",

The building's surveillance system identifies the presence of Bruce Wayne in the building. As Riddler completes the transfer of the computer files onto a removable disk, the security system informes the villains that Wayne has stopped outside their door. However, when the door opens, Batman greets the villains instead.</p><p>Riddler and his men dash from the building into a van; Batman follows in the Batmobile. He receives a call from Red Tornado, informing him that Aquaman is still missing. Batman stops Riddler's van and pursues him to a club called the Batcave. The two trade blows before the villain's associates grab Batman. However, in a bar named for Batman, he has many allies. The Riddler unleashes a torrent of light and question marks and escapes; Batman gathers a few clues, and leaves.</p><p>Elsewhere Jonathan Crane (aka the Scarecrow) is seen administering an injection to a sickly girl, who miraculously walks again. Flash runs to a desert which has been revitalized. The inhabitants inform him that a man arrived with a gun that first made ice, and that the ice became the sea. Flash wonders what Captain Cold could be up to. Elsewhere, Poison Ivy commands a huge stalk to grow, providing an entire city with much-needed food.</p><p>Batman trails Riddler to the cemetery, armed with heat goggles that make him immune to Riddler's hologram technology. He attacks Riddler again, finally besting the villain and demanding the disk. As Batman holds him, the Riddler begins to strangle himself. Finally, he releases his grip and asks what's wrong with him. Back in the Batcave, Batman tells Alfred that he is very concerned that the Riddler had his hands on the disk's information. In Arkham, Riddler interacts with the Joker, who has heard about the apocalyptic dreams the others are having, and he wants to be involved in the grand scheme.</p><p>Elsewhere, Aquaman lies strapped to a table; he is to be subject to experiments. Brainiac appears bearing a scalpel, informing Aquaman that he wants to get inside his head.</p>",

            "description": "<em>Overview</em>  For more than ten years, pop culture cultists have revered and adored a mysterious, brooding thirteen-year-old girl named Emily the Strange. Nobody knows much about the young girl with a porcelain face and huge eyes framed by black bangs, and her ever-present brood of black cats only adds to the intrigue-but that hasn't stopped a generation of rabid fans from letting Emily put her spell upon them. Now Emily fans are invited into her odd, mysterious world-a place where kitty friends talk, the ghosts of famous weirdos come out to play, reality is never quite what it seems, and-above all-a place where anyone who's ever been considered a little \"strange\" themselves will be made to feel right at home. <br /><br />Dark Horse Comics and the creative minds behind Cosmic Debris are thrilled to present the second issue of <em>Emily</em>, with all-new stories and art. Each issue of<em>Emily</em> comics features 48 pages of black, white, and red art (with the occasional outburst of full-color freakouts!), illustrating a wacky range of Emily stories. <br /><br />• Emily the Strange is the star of a best-selling line of merchandise and fashion accessories from the creative brain trust known as Cosmic Debris. Visit www.Emilystrange.com.<br /><br /><strong>• </strong>Also included in this issue is a bonus Emily fold-out poster highlighting the theme of this issue and showing what Emily does best - \"get lost”!",

Writer Steve Englehart and artists Marshall Rogers &amp; Terry Austin set a high standard with their acclaimed run on DETECTIVE COMICS in the late 1970s! Now that team is back with BATMAN: DARK DETECTIVE, a miniseries that pits the Dark Knight against the most famous and feared members of his Rogues Gallery! In the startling debut issue, the Joker enters a gubernatorial election using the campain slogan \"Vote for me or I'll kill you!\" Will it persuade voters? Plus, Bruce Wayne's old love interest Silver St. Cloud returns, as do Two-Face and the Scarecrow! And the action continues in the startling second issue, as the Scarecrow manages to overcome Batman in the one location where he's most vulnerable: the Batcave! Meanwhile, the Bruce Wayne/Silver St. Cloud relationship heats up! Issue #1.</em><br /><br />Joker found Two-Face waiting for him at his hideout. The former District Attorney warned him not to run for governor.<br />After seeing Evan off to one of his events, Silver visited Wayne Manor. After they agreed on friendship, Bruce insisted on showing her the cave beneath the house. While inside, he believed Joe Chill and several of his enemies were in the cave, then realized he'd been attacked by the Scarecrow (possibly as a policeman the night before - time released fear gas). When he'd overcome it, he and Silver admitted their love for each other. They gave into their passion as the Joker killed the first victim who didn't pay his demands.<br />Commissioner Akin wondered about Batman.",

            "description": "<p><i>The first episode of V.2 recounts the story of Aaron Gawain, a werewolf. At the age of sixteen, Aaron is rescued from his alcoholic, abusive father by a strange gentleman named Nebiros and taken to his castle to live with him. Though treated with kindness and care, Aaron is virtually a prisoner at the castle which is guarded by a horde of she-wolves at all times. As time passes, Aaron develops a feeling of love towards his captor. One day in Nebiros' absence, however, a jealous she-wolf tricks Aaron out of the castle, and attacks him. Nebiros appears just in time to save Aaron's life, but abandons him forever for his betrayal. Bitten by the she-wolf, Aaron, too, is now doomed to the fate of a werewolf: he turns into a wolf on the fifteenth of each month and roams around the city killing everyone in sight. Aaron decides to work at the Tarot Cafe as an assistant while looking for the solution to his problem. In the next episode, we learn more about our main character, Pamela. Pamela was born more than 700 years ago in Scotland. Her mother, a gifted medicine woman and a tarot card reader herself, foresees that Pamela's ability to predict future will jeopardize her life, and makes a pact with the devil who promises eternal life for Pamela. Soon thereafter, Pamela's mother is accused of witchcraft and burned at the stakes, but young Pamela's life is spared. Abandoned in the forest where she must fend for herself, Pamela meets Ash, her future lover, mentor and protector...700 years later, in the present day, Pamela encounters reincarnated Ash, being pursued by a gang of thugs. The thugs, who call themselves Albigensian Crusaders, eventually kidnap Pamela and Ash and subject them to a secret witch trial. Pamela and Ash are saved from certain death by Pamela's friend Belous...</i></p>",
