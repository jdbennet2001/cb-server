            "description": "<p><i>The Initiative's biggest secret hasn't come back to haunt them, it's come back to KILL THEM! Blood will run, heads will roll, and this time \"dead\" means DEAD! Say goodbye to at LEAST one regular cast member as KILLED IN ACTION starts racking up its body count. You know, maybe this WASN'T such a good time for TASKMASTER, ANT-MAN, and the new recruits to sign up…\"</i></p><p>Picking up from the end of last issue, a small Hank Pym stands before a recruit with the Tactigon on his arm. Hank orders him to lower the weapon so they can talk. He just tells him he's on his lists and fires at Hank. Hank apparently is blown away. The kid walks away and says, \"Henry Pym, a.k.a. Yellow Jacket...Killed In Action.\"</p><p>Flashback to earlier that day. Taskmaster is putting the new recruits to the test. he's actually mopping the floor with them. Crusader simply stands back. When Taskmaster asks him why he isn't taking part in the exercise, he replies that the smart thing to do is admit they don't stand a chance or wait until someone else gets in a lucky shot. Taskmaster is impressed with this logic. The truth is Crusader is a Skrull and doesn't want to risk getting knocked out and be revealed.</p><p>In the Infirmary, Trauma is sitting with Cloud 9. He's trying to help her through having shot a Hydra agent. Changing his appearance as the agent, Cloud 9 is able to talk to him and apologize for killing him. Beast and Moonstar observe and are impressed with Trauma's newfound therapist abilities.</p><p>In the Weapons Cache, Hank Pym and Henry Gyrich enter the vault containing the Tactigon. Gyrich isn't happy with the weapon just sitting there.</p><p>In the lab, Baron Von Blitzschlag is working with another MVP clone. The clone claims he is Michael Van Patrick. The Baron says he can't use that name since one of the other clones is already using the name in Kentucky. He suggests going by Van Patrick's middle name but the clone won't budge.</p><p>Hank comes in with the Tactigon. He brings it to the clone and asks if he's willing to try it out. As it bonds to him, he gets a flashback to when MVP was shot and killed. He is able to access the classified data on what really happened. Seeing that \"he\" was killed in action, he loses his mind. The Baron is smashed against the wall as Hank grows to a large size. That just makes him a bigger target for the Tactigon. Before the clone can finish him off, Hank shrinks down and runs away. The clone then smashes the other clones sitting in the lab tubes. He carves on his chest the letters, \"KIA.\"</p><p>Back in the Combat Simulator, the recruits are still being tested by Taskmaster. KIA smashes through a wall. The recruits see this as their opportunity to unite and be on the other end of a beating. That's not the case. They are soon all unconscious. An alarm is sent throughout the base. KIA is about to deal with Taskmaster when he excuses himself for a moment. From the other room Taskmaster can hear, \"Yellowjacket. You're on my list,\" followed by a big zap.</p><p>KIA returns to Taskmaster. He asks if he's on his list too. KIA thinks and says no. He leaves them alone and Taskmaster tries to help Crusader find his missing hand.</p><p>Trauma and Thor Girl stumble upon KIA. Trauma is surprised because he knows MVP is dead. KIA tells him he's on his list. Thor Girl stands in front of Trauma as KIA fires. She doesn't take the hit so well. Enraged, Trauma transforms into what he thinks will scare him. He's actually become the one thing the Tactigon is afraid of. The problem is, KIA isn't afraid of it. The Tactigon transforms into a blade and goes right through Trauma.</p><p>Next is Gauntlet, who is still in a coma in the infirmary. Going to his bed, KIA finds the bed empty.</p><p>In the Weapons Cache, someone rips off the door to the vault. Gauntlet grabs an alien sword. Speaking the alien language, he is ready for action.</p>",

It’s wall-to-wall mayhem as Mark Bagley joins Avengers writer Bendis in this globe–trotting spectacle filled with hints about next year’s SECRET INVASION!</em></p><p>In 1211, Dr. Doom pays another visit to Morgan Le Fey. It seems he has visited her several times and even tells her that she \"entices\" him. She tells him that the next time he comes she wants something from the future. He tells her that could damage the timestream. She tells him to bring a gift or not to come back.</p><p>Arriving in Castle Doom in the present, he discovers that they are on red alert. His scientists inform him that there was a problem with one of their satellites and the Venom Virus was launched on New York. They are about to be attacked by American heroes. Doom is not happy.</p><p>The Mighty Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. are en route with a full scale attack. Doom launches a counterattack before they get there. Iron Man asks Ares what his battle plan is. Turns out it is to fly the quinjet straight into the castle. Doombots attack as the citizens of Latveria scatter. What follows is a long scene of havoc and destruction.</p><p>Iron Man eventually makes his way into the castle. He tells him as the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. he is placing him under arrest for crimes against mankind. Doom tells him he does not recognize his authority. They begin a standoff. Both have their armor working against each other. Doom then sets to use magic against Stark's technology. Doom tells him that he has learned so much since they last fought. Things don't look too good for Iron Man as his armor's resources are nearing depletion.</p><p>Sentry flies straight at Doom and knocks him back and through the floor. Both Doom and Iron Man's armors require a reboot. They land in Doom's lab on top of the time platform. There is a space-time fluctuation detected. Doom begins yelling at them for the fools that they are. With the room lighting up, Sentry attempts to grab Iron Man's arm, telling him they should get out of there. There is a large explosion and the three are gone.</p><p>Ms. Marvel recognizes that in the center of the explosion is the remains of Doom's time platform. It seems they may be lost in time.</p><p>Iron Man comes to on top of a city building. His armor has rebooted but cannot find any internet or satellite connections. Doom appears behind him, not to happy and vows that he will pay for this.</p>",

Karate Kid vs getting dissected! Piper vs Brother Eye. Whoa. Back up story: The Origin of Black Manta by Scott Beatty adn Mike Norton. Glub glub.</i></p><p>Piper manages to get to his feet and still has his pipe in hand. Inside Brothery Eye, he doesn't know where he actually is. He sees Desaad unconscious on the ground and notices a device in the palm of his hand. Hoping that it would give him a way out or an idea where he is, Piper pushes the button. Desaad's hand begins to glow and he jumps up, demanding that Piper plays his flute. Just then the OMAC that used to be Una comes in carrying Karate Kid. Desaad begins yelling at the OMAC that Piper is his. He tells him he can have all of Apokilips but everything that he has planned depends on Piper now. Piper is surprised by this. Desaad tells him that he found out Piper was a rare human that can be a vessel for the Anti-Life. He arranged things with the Penguin to cuff him to Trickster in order to physically and mentally break him down. The OMAC tires of listening to Desaad and \"mutes\" him.</p><p>Darkseid and Solomon continue their game. Darkseid is willing to allow Brother EYE to have Apokolips. He understands what the bigger picture is and which individuals can change things.</p><p>Back in Brother EYE, Jason enters after following the OMAC carrying Karate Kid. He is surprised to see the Pied Piper there. The Challengers along with Mary Marvel, Holly Robinson, and Harley Quinn are trying to find Jason even though Kyle would rather not. Mary notices that all the OMACS are just flying over them without giving them any notice. Kyle figures that after they consume Apokolips and become the planet, they'll be easy pickings. They find a way inside and are unknowingly being followed by Desaad, who wants the Piper back.</p><p>Now that Karate Kid is before Brother EYE, it is noted that his body is the product of a thousand years of human evolution. Karate Kid is an incubator for the Morticoccus Virus and EYE plans on dissecting him. Piper notices Red Robin has arrived by the device that is containing Firestorm. Unfortunately the OMAC also detects his presence. The OMAC goes after Jason with the idea of absorbing him while EYE starts the dissection. Jason manages to avoid the OMAC's blows and tricks it into smashing Firestorm free. Firestorm is not fully awake and Jason ends up getting blasted in the chest just as the others arrive.</p><p>The Challengers and company begin fighting the OMAC while Ray Palmer destroys the equipment that's started dissecting Karate Kid. EYE tells him the interference is temporary. EYE also tells him that the Morticoccus is now EYE's to unleash on humanity. Kyle manages to contain the OMAC with his ring. Ray notices that Brother EYE won't bring in the other OMACs inside out of fear of being damaged as Firestorm is now on his feet. Brother EYE agrees with Ray and teleports them outside via a Boom Tube. They are now completely surrounded.</p><p>Slowly, Piper tries to make his getaway only to run into Desaad again. Desaad once more grabs him and demands that he begin to play. He tells Piper that he can end the madness that surrounds him. By playing, he'll unleash the Anti-Life Equation. Piper begins to play and Desaad can't believe what's happening. He thought that Piper was completely broken down but instead, the music causes Desaad's head to explode. Piper tells him that was for what happened to Trickster. Brother EYE is next. He begins playing again and there is major destruction. It seems that Brother EYE has no choice but to retreat.</p><p>The Challengers now face an unstable planet as the OMACs are simply falling to the ground. Una is freed but doesn't know where Karate Kid is. The Challengers and company are ready to leave except Kyle is unconscious now. They need his ring in order to get out of there.</p>",
