Slade's ship almost goes too far inland on the shores of the ruins of Paris. Slade's ship is then boarded by Aquaman so they can kill everyone on the ship.</p><p>In Gotham City, Barry is in shock realizing that this Batman is Thomas Wayne. Batman then injures Barry's arm. Batman interrogates Barry asking him who is he and who is he working with. Barry declares he is the Flash, the fastest man alive, Batman then quips he wasn't fast enough to avoid his attacks. Barry insists that he just doesn't have his powers and no one remembers and that he needs Batman's help. Batman tells him he came to the wrong place. Then a surge of memories of this world starts to flash in Barry's head. Then his ring falls on the floor, Barry then uses it to prove to Batman who he is,and when the suit pops out Barry realizes that it's the Reverse Flash's costume who is probably moving so fast around that he becomes invisible to them. Barry explains his relationship with Eobard who killed his mother and had Barry's father convicted for it. Barry then explains to Thomas that in his reality Bruce survived the mugging and became Batman. Thomas asks him if Barry had his powers could he revert it to the other way, but first he needs his speed back before he forgets everything he ever knew.</p><p>In London or known now as New Themyscira, a group of Amazonians ambush a man with blond hair. Wonder Woman uses her lasso of truth and learns this man is Steve Trevor, a colonel in the the U.S. Special Forces, and his assignment is to find Lois Lane, who is in New Themyscira gathering intel on the Amazons for Cyborg.</p><p>In Gotham, Barry Allen and Thomas Wayne are gathering the materials needed to recreate the scenario needed so Barry Allen can become the Flash once again.

The one name that still speaks volumes of how absolute power can corrupt - Caligula. After his assassination attempt goes horribly and horrifyingly wrong young Junius finds himself taken in by Caligula, who renames him Felix, meaning 'lucky one', and becomes the Emperor's pet, confidant, whipping boy, lover, apprentice, and biographer. Caligula lavishes money and women on Felix one minute than beats him the next. Felix must play along if he's to find out the secret behind Caligula's mysterious supernatural power over life and death. Virgin blood ceremonies, gladiator fights rigged for added brutality, and dinner parties where guests are randomly slaughtered, is there any limit to Caligula's depravity? Can Felix keep his focus and sanity in the face of so much misery and horror? A modern master of horror, Lapham digs deep into the world of Rome 37 AD and offers a unique epic of sin. Joined by new talent German Nobile who promises to serve up fully-painted pages dripping with blood, this all-new, full-color series will be six issues of evil that will make any Crossed fan smile with glee. For in the age of Caligula, all roads lead to Hell.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Murder, mayhem and the building of an empire! Issue #2 throttles up the action as Batman tries to find the source of the attacks before the killer can strike again. But with the reveal of the fourth family of Gotham City and an old case from the early days of the city, is Batman playing right into the villain's hands?</i></p><p>Batman Gates of Gotham begins with Journey entries from an Nicholas Anders. He talks about how Gotham began, and how in 1840 Judge Solomon Wayne commission Cyrus Pinkney to construct buildings in Gotham. Later in 1860, Nicholas Anders moves to Gotham with his father and stepbrother. Nicholas Anders would talk about how him and his brother, Bradley would go to the tall buildings hoping to go to the clouds. They dreamed skyscrapers that would pierced the sky. They would become so obsessed with this dream that they become draftsmen for Architecture. Nicholas was an \"idea\" man while Bradley was the technician.</p><p>One day in 1871, a man named Alan Wayne came to the two brothers in search to expand his family business. Nicholas found this to be beneficial since this was what they wanted. Alan Wayne shared his dream, which was to find a way to take Gotham to the future. The first project they worked on was The New Trigate bridge-a new suspension bridge. During construction, Bradley and the unknown character approached Alan Wayne with other drawings for \"their\" Gotham. Then Alan Wayne brings the two brothers to a meeting with other influential families of Gotham, Theodore Cobblepot and Edward Elliot.</p><p>In Present day, Commissioner Gordon, Red Robin are investigating Tommy Elliot's disappearance. They go through the footage and see Tommy is kidnapped by a man in a steam punk outfit. They all decide to evacuate the Wayne and Cobblepot owned buildings. Then Tommy is with his steampunk kidnapper, and he says he respects what the man is doing. Then he makes a request that this man not attack the Waynes because if he does, Tommy will kill them. Later Damian and Cassandra Cain are on patrol. While they protect the Cobblepot building, Dick is searching the Elliot mansion. Dick thinks about how he thinks he knows Gotham but he realizes he knows so little. All of sudden Bombs are found in the Iceberg Lounge and Wayne Tower. In the Iceberg Lounge, Damian and Cassandra Cain try to dismantle the bomb. At Wayne Tower Batman finds the Bomb tied to Tommy Elliot. Since both bombs had accelerated dead man's switches Batman had to save Tommy Elliot over saving Wayne Tower. Cassandra had to pull out Damian because he was too stubborn to leave. Tommy laughs at dick telling him how can he hope to protect Gotham's future when you're so naive of its past. Then he reveals the Gates aren't what but who.</p>",

Yet his priorities change when he meets Hal Jordan and realizes how valuable and worth saving Earth is. As he forms an allegiance with Cyborg to save the doomed planet, Abin Sur is secretly visited by Sinestro.

And what does it mean for their relationship?</i></p><p>Abin and his spacecraft have crashed on Earth, but he has apparently not received any unrecoverable injuries. When the human Hal Jordan approaches, Abin requests his help in saving Earth. However, Cyborg appears on the scene and declares that the ship is now property of the United States. Once Abin has healed, he explains the situation to Cyborg, as well as his intention to save the Earth.</p><p>Later, at the White House, the President presents Abin Sur to the world as a rescuer of hundreds of European refugees. As Abin scans for survivors in Europe, he finds only one, Sinestro, who tells Abin about the Flashpoint prophecy. When Abin doesn't believe him, Sinestro declares that as long as Abin is alive, his plans cannot work. As they fight, Sinestro cuts off Abin's hand, and his ring with it.</p>",

Viper and his posse discover a vault piled high with gold but guarded by a dying man armed for Armageddon. He draws his last breath with only a single word of warning: 'Run!' All hope of unraveling the mystery of Brimstone lies with Annabelle, the camp whore, captured fleeing town. She's an exotic beauty with a razor-wire tongue and a steely resolve; Viper's match in nearly every respect. But Annabelle ain't volunteering any information to her new captors. The men argue over what to do with her, even as a hidden foe stalks them in the advancing darkness. Night begins with a shriek and the most vicious attack ever witnessed in the Old West. Tonight, the battle for Brimstone boils with blood.  <br/></em>",

The vicious gangster bosses of London's East End find themselves brought into contact with a counter-culture underground of mystical and medicated flower-children, or amoral pop-stars on the edge of psychological disintegration and developing a taste for Satanism. Alerted to a threat concerning the same magic order that she and her colleagues were investigating during 1910, a thoroughly modern Mina Murray and her dwindling league of comrades attempt to navigate the perilous rapids of London's hippy and criminal subculture, as well as the twilight world of its occultists. Starting to buckle from the pressures of the twentieth century and the weight of their own endless lives, Mina and her companions must nevertheless prevent the making of a Moonchild that might well turn out to be the antichrist.</i></p>",

Twisted by their own terror as well as the reality-warping powers of a fear-drunk Man-Thing, Marvel’s Strangest Heroes transform into horrendous versions of themselves. Howard the Duck, Nighthawk, Frankenstein, and She-Hulk mutate from hero to monster freaks—and instead of saving the city the foursome just might end it. It’s a mad tale told by Brandon Montclare, Ryan Bodenheim, with covers by living legend Michael Wm Kaluta. And joining the ghastly crew of creators and characters, the one and only Simon Bisley illustrates a special in-story Spotlight!</i></p>",

Leonid makes his choice between his two fathers, Michelangelo and Tesla kick their plan into high gear and Howard Stark lays the foundation for the organization you know as S.H.I.E.L.D.</i></p><p>1503: Florence. Leonardo Da Vinci straps himself into a machine while the finishing touches are placed on the first ever Life Model Decoy in his likeness (and that will later show up in Secret Warriors). His intent is that the LMD will live out his life as if it were him, while he leaves for the future.</p><p>1960: The Immortal City. Leonid is shocked to see his father, Nikola Tesla, again. Stark and Richards are just as surprised by the devastation of the battle going on in the city. Spotting an opening, Newton leaps to stab Leonardo but Stark stops him by dismantling his weapon mid-flight. Newton is furious that those who follow Da Vinci have abandoned what Shield believe in. Michelangelo appears and tells everyone that the supply of the Infinity Formula is dwindling and Newton’s promise of eternal life for his followers is a lie. Newton is still insistent that the end of the world is unavoidable, but Tesla says that he, Stark and Richards have seen the future, so it isn’t true. The Shield council is called to judge Da Vinci and Newton. Tesla and Stark charge up a machine that projects the thoughts of the two accused men. Da Vinci is revealed to be full of self doubt and mistrust. Newton reveals that he killed Galileo and many others in his quest to ‘end man.’ Leonid sides with Da Vinci, but before anything can happen, Newton puts on Da Vinci’s teleportation/winged suit and disappears into the future. Michelangelo already knew this would happen and says they must travel after him ‘to the very end.’</p><p>Later, Stark builds a machine to leave a message behind, thinking he won’t come back.</p><p>In the Immortal City, Nostradamus frantically searches for some more Infinity Formula. As he does so, the Celestial discovers Newton’s math equations. The knowledge drives it crazy and it expands to a huge size, busting out of the building and into the city.</p>",

            "description": "<br/><p>The end of the previous issue saw Diane Coverdale’s house being attacked and Acteia about to confront Iris, but as this issue begins with Acteia awakening in what is essentially a hospital bed, I think we all know who won that battle.</p><p>This is the first part in the Hit List Agenda storyline that has dropped the standard of the rest of the issues. Acteia has been taken from Diane, but there is no mention of what happened to Diane after this, which is strange. We find out who Iris is working for (Duncan Villone, who seems to want some form of world domination, but who doesn’t) but it isn’t clear why or how this situation came about. It was all very uneventful and uninspiring.</p><p>The art is also a little inconsistent, particularly on Acteia’s face, which switches between round and angular, attractive and not. The brief fight scene at the end of the issue is cool and has some interesting layouts, but as it is pointless from a storytelling point of view, it doesn’t have the same impact as previous conflicts.</p><p>As Iris kidnapped Acteia for Duncan Villone, it seems like he might be trying to put together some sort of Executive Assistant army (dependent on how many he can control) and that could be interesting. But event series such as this can’t afford to drop the pace or the level interest and it is a shame that this has happened. However, I have already read the next issue of this cross over series (Orchid #2, which will be reviewed very soon) and things certainly do hot up again.</p>",

As a result of Gabriel's death, Epoch, the tournament that determines the leader of the Supernatural Council has been enacted for the first time in millennia. Now a mere human must safely navigate the politics and battles between angels, demons, werewolves, vampires and the other Supernatural races.</i></p><p>Jonah discovers about the secret council of supernatural creatures. The council is composed of eight supernatural orders, the Angel Order, the Demon Order, the Troll Order, the Gorgon Order, the Banshee Order, the Vampire Order, the Werewolf Order and the Warlock Order. Jonah also discovers that Mya Tokage is the leader of the Gorgon Order. At the meeting, Tobias Atrox, the leader of the Angel Order convinces the council to let Gabriel and Jonah investigate Michael's murder.</p><p>Later, Gabriel reveals to Jonah that millenia ago, as the number of humans grew exponentially, the supernaturals, although stronger began to fear for their survival. As mankind drove them to the brink of extinction, the supernaturals united in fear and eight supernatural races formed the council for mutual survival. To determine the leader of the council a tournament called Epoch is held. The winner of the tournament gets to appoint the leader of the council. Michael was the winner of the last Epoch and he appointed himself. Gabriel, an archangel himself, was being groomed as Michael's successor, however he falls in love with a mortal woman (Jonah's mother) and cuts off his own wings.</p><p>Meanwhile in preparation for the next Epoch, Tobias persuades his wife Aliyah to train Jonah as he is the last one with Archangel blood. To which Aliyah reluctantly agrees. Following the murder investigation Jonah and Gabriel visits a nightclub owned by Cyrus, the leader of the Vampire order. After a brief confrontation with the warlock Griffin Cyrus tells Jonah to \"follow the blood\".</p>",

The creature's roots run deeper than he knows, and the Parliament of Trees intends to make him understand the responsibility he wants so desperately to avoid! With this issue, the mythology of the Swamp Thing branches out in ways you never saw coming – don't miss it!</i></p><p> </p><p>We start off with a flashback, into the past of Calbraith A. H. Rodgers. He is flying a plane in WWII when he is shot down and crashes into a swamp. His body is taken over by the swamp and he becomes that generations Swamp Thing. He tells Alec that he has been sent by the Parliament of Trees to deliver a message. The Green wants him back to become the new Swamp Thing. Alec is still reluctant and so Rodgers connects with his mind to show him of the impending doom.</p><p>He shows him a creature known as Sethe, a force of death and rot that is gathering an army to destroy the world. Alec states that he does not want to become the Swamp Thing again, and Rodgers tells him that he never was. The Parliament could not save his body to attach to the Swamp Thing so they attempted to recreate his consciousness. Having finished, Rodgers begins to leave and just as he does he warns Alec; he should beware of a girl with white hair.</p><p>He goes back to his room when he sees the desk clerk and says hi. Back in his room Alec begins to dress and pack when the desk lady (who is now being controlled by Sethe) comes into the room and attacks him with an axe. He dodges the strike and runs outside only to be met with a group of Sethe followers. Suddenly a girl on a motorcycle, packing a shotgun helps him and they ride away. They stop off and when they do the girl takes off her helmet and introduces herself as Abigail Arcane all whilst pointing a gun at his head.</p>",

An unprecedented scientific disaster has created Hell on Earth, and Pandora finds that in one fell swoop, her unrealistic dream of a quick victory over Hellina has been dashed. Possessed by the Hell-spawned demon from another dimension, Pandora’s hesitant ally, Widow, is now in the clutches of Hellina, but the intentions of the dark intruders into our reality remains a mystery. The only hope in reversing the possession and saving both Widow and the innocent Sandra who has been transformed into Hellina lies in the hands of the Louisiana swamp witch, Anathema. But before Pandora can enlist the aid of her one-time friend, she’ll have to face a horror lurking under the fetid, bayou waters… This epic saga is written by Mike (Lady Death) Wolfer and featured the art of Pow (Justice League) Rodrix wrapped in a stunning new cover by Matt Martin! Available with a Regular or Gore cover by Matt Martin, as well as a Wraparound and a special Art Nouveau Retailer Order Incentive by painter Michael Dipascale!</i></p>",

Batman will need all his intellect, cunning and physical prowess to take on The Man of Steel.</i></p><p>At the Central City crime lab, Barry Allen draws close to solving the case of a husband and father murdered in the parking lot of his office. However, Director Singh has other orders for him. At the directive of the Chief of Police, all police resources have been allocated to discovering the true identity of the Flash, a costumed vigilante with superhuman speed.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Metropolis, Batman has emptied his utility belt fighting Superman and there is still no stopping the Kryptonian. Superman believes that Batman and Green Lantern are somehow tied to the alien invaders, who carried a box identical to the one Batman brought from Gotham. Green Lantern rejoins the fight, but he knows they’ll need backup.</p><p>Green Lantern has previously joined forces with the Flash, most recently to save Central City from a talking gorilla. He knows that the Flash and Barry Allen are one and the same, and the Flash knows that he is Hal Jordan. Green Lantern calls upon the Flash now, knowing they can’t defend themselves from Superman without him.</p><p>In an instant, the Flash runs from Central City to Metropolis. He’s the fastest man alive, faster even than Superman. Still, Superman’s speed is enough to land a blow on him, much to Flash’s surprise.</p><p>Even though Superman bests him, the Flash has still distracted him long enough for Batman to reason with the Kryptonian. The Flash does his best to clean up the collateral damage, but Metropolis police soon arrive, driving the four vigilantes into the sewers.</p><p>While the four seek safe harbor to study the box from Gotham, its twin from Metropolis arrives in a S.T.A.R. Labs facility in Detroit. Though they’ve made little progress, they discover that the box is broadcasting some kind of signal. Similar signals are being broadcast from New England, the District of Columbia, Central City, Coast City; all areas of meta-human activity.</p><p>As a leading scientist in the study of the meta-human presence, Dr. Silas Stone heads off the research. He is interrupted by a visit from his son, Vic, who is upset that his father missed yet another game. Stone argues that his work is about to make his son’s abilities obsolete, and Vic is crushed.</p><p>Just then, the boxes activate. Simultaneously, in Metropolis and in Detroit, their pinging increases in speed. They begin to glow, generating massive amounts of energy. With a reality-warping BOOM! each tears open an inter-dimensional portal, through which pour hordes of monstrous alien soldiers.</p><p>In Detroit, Vic Stone gets caught in the portal’s energy, and his body quickly burns away before his father’s eyes...</p>",

But how can he shut out the signals floating in the air – especially when they're crying out for help?</i></p><p>Captain Atom has a problem controlling his new powers as they are acting as an antenna making him unstable.  This causes conflict at the Continuum on the danger.  It also causes internal conflict with the Captain himself.  </p><p>The Captain in particular hears a little boy who needs help.  The Captain then leaves on a mission of mercy to help a boy struggling with cancer.  It is here that the Captain discovers just how god-like his powers are.</p><p>In the prologue a man sees a dangerous dog that can actually mimic the man himself.  It may be the man's first and last issue.  In another prologue for Batman Noel, Batman tracts down a lead.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>When the alien creature known as Morphicius starts draining the life force from Carter Hall, a.k.a. Hawkman, he learns that there's more to his new victim than meets the eye. The mysterious properties of the Nth Metal protect Hawkman – but in the process, they are also making Morphicius powerful! With innocent lives in the balance, can Hawkman turn the table on his enemy, or are Morphicius newfound powers too powerful to stop?</i></p><p>Morphicius continues absorbing Hawkman's armor, but Hawkman, through sheer force of will, unleashes a powerful burst of energy that blasts Morphicius back. Hawkman and Morphicius resume their fight, but Morphicius holds the advantage, saying that he can master the Nth Metal faster than Hawkman can. Hawkman, refusing to surrender, dissipates his armor and tells Morphicius that he is ready to fight and he has nothing to lose. Morphicius replies that Hawkman has indeed something to lose, just not right now, and flies away.</p><p>At the Non-Lethal Alternative Studies headquarters, two agents have come to meet Dr. Hogarth Kane, a top scientist at N.L.A.S., telling him that the Under-secretary of Military Preparedness has cut down N.L.A.S.'s budget due to money constraints. The agents demand to see Kane's progress, and he agrees, on the condition that his methods are not put on official record. The agents agrees, and Kane shows them their tests on simians. The ultimate objective is to expose soldiers to neuro-interrupters to improve their combat effectiveness. However, the simians have died during the experiments.</p><p>Then, Askana, Kane's assistant, calls him for an emergency and Kane excuses himself. Kane recieves a phonecall from an unnamed person. As soon as he hangs up, Askana asks Kane if they have custody of the subject. Kane replies that the subject is still on the loose, but he has his best hunter on its trail.</p><p>Carter wakes up at the hospital, with Emma at his side. Professor Ziegler and Terrance come into Carter's room, saying that the police have notified the families of Morphicius's victims. Carter asks Professor Ziegler what does he think about Morphicius and Ziegler replies that there is no way the creature's blood cells could thrive in freezing temperatures. He believes that the cells heated themselves up in a form of adaptation. Ziegler gives Carter a photo depicting the symbols form the craft that carried Morphicius. Carter offers to decipher them and Emma agrees.</p><p>Suddenly, a nurse comes into the room and tells Carter that the police wants to talk to him, and Carter agrees. But as soon as everyone leaves, Carter jumps off the window and manifests his armor, flying away.</p><p>In Manhattan, Morphicius is losing control of the Nth metal and falls to a secluded alley. There, he finds a mysterious man who identifies himself as Waker, the last Vexaphon. Although Morphicius attacks him, Waker tells him that he has been sent to save his life.</p><p>In Brooklyn, Hawkman returns to his apartment and dissipates his armor. Carter believes that after using the Nth metal after so many years, the Nth metal might have gotten into his bloodstream. As he enters the building, he finds some people taking his taking his furniture. Mr. Gomez, the man in charge of the building, tells Carter that he is being evicted, saying that Carter had 30 days's notice. Carter replies that he can pay Mr. Gomez, he just needs to go to the bank, but Mr. Gomez doesn't believe it, as Carter is behind three months, plus a couple more thousands in damages. Then, Carter gives Mr. Gomez a box full of money, and Mr. Gomez tells the moving people to put Carter's furniture back into his apartment.</p><p>Later, Carter begins deciphering the symbols, and discovers that the symbols are describing a warning. Apparently, Morphicius was being transported to an intergalactic prison to be executed. Suddenly, Emma appears on his doorstep, having brought some food.</p><p>As she enters Carter's apartment, Emma tells him that he is not in any real trouble, except for leaving the hospital without a proper discharge, but the police wants him to call them as soon as he can. Then, Emma asks him how could he charge against the alien while everybody else ran away. Carter asks her if she wants him to feel guilty for getting all those men killed. Emma feels insulted, saying that she had to take care of her father after his recent Alzheimer's diagnosis. Then, Carter abruptly leaves Emma.</p><p>At the N.L.A.S. headquarters, scientists have been examinating the weakened Morphicius. Apparently, Morphicius's body is rejecting his latest acquisition. Kane says that maybe they should let Morphicius die, believing they could get better data from an autopsy, but Waker won't let him. Suddenly, Askana kills him, revealing a Xenusian claw. Afterwards, Kane states that they will proceed with their mission: the Extinction Virus.</p><p>To be continued...</p>",

In the second volume of A Game of Thrones, the irresistible plot thickens and the spellbinding magic of a master storyteller deepens. For Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, a new role now beckons: Hand of the King-a position of power second only to his majesty himself. But is a life at court, in luxurious King's Landing, any life for a hardened man of action like Stark? Is the king's invitation an honor he can refuse-or a mandate he cannot ignore, when faced with shocking revelations of treachery on high?</i></p><p>King Robert Baratheon arrives at Winterfell to make a request of his childhood friend, Eddard Stark. Catelyn Stark receives disturbing news.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Garth Ennis continues the epic story begun in his film, Stitched! Deep behind enemy lines in war-torn Afghanistan, the surviving crew members of a downed American Blackhawk helicopter faced certain death until the arrival of the three British SAS soldiers who the chopper crew was to extract from unfriendly territory. Death could find them in a dozen different ways, but it's not enemy fire, dehydration or exposure to the elements which the refuge-seeking group fears most- It's the \"Stitches,\" the fearsome, corpse-like dead men who hunt the desert wastes, ripping apart both Taliban fighters and coalition forces alike. With precious little water and limited ammo, the six embark on a flight for survival across a desert littered with the corpses of the mutilated and enforced by the supernaturally-animated \"Stitches.\" This new on-going series is certain to appeal to Ennis' legions of fans as it pushes the envelope of horror beyond the boundaries of sanity and into fresh nightmares. Stitched #2 is available with a Regular cover, Wraparound cover, and Gore cover by series artist Mike Wolfer, and a special Stitched Movie Photo cover retailer incentive cover.</i></p>",

Unafraid to tackle social satire and grown-up action-adventure, Gottfredson produced a Mouse for all ages — truly popular in a way that Mickey’s blander 1950s image could never be.</i></p><p><i>In this book you’ll relive Mickey’s fight with pirates on desolate Treasure Island; his quest with Goofy to catch ruthless counterfeiters; and his battles to save windy Horace Horsecollar from mad scientists, a robbery frame- up — and himself!</i></p><p><i>Lovingly restored from Disney’s original negatives and proof sheets, “Mickey Mouse: Trapped on Treasure Island” also includes more than 50 pages of fascinating supplementary features. You’ll enjoy rare behind-the-scenes art, vintage publicity material, and vivid commentary by a full team of seasoned Disney scholars.</i></p><p><i>Walt Disney often said that his studio’s success “all started with a mouse” — and today Mickey is among the world’s most recognizable icons in the world. Now it’s time to rediscover the wild, unforgettable personality behind the icon: Floyd Gottfredson’s Mickey Mouse.</i></p>",

But in doing so, Tony Stark has lost just about everything: his armor, his power - even his very mind. Now, at his absolute lowest point, it will take Tony's last reservoir of will - and a band of brothers including Thor, Captain America, War Machine and Black Widow - to keep from losing it all and sow the seeds for a brighter tomorrow. Stark Industries' arms-manufacturing days are over: Tony's new company, Stark Resilient, is bringing modern tech to the masses without bringing innocent people to their knees. But there's a competitor on the scene, a mother/daughter team with a very familiar name ready to pick up the slack with an armor called Detroit Steel. They've started a deadly game of international intrigue that will bring one of Iron Man's deadliest foes back into the fray - but for the Hammer girls, that was merely the opening salvo. With War Machine grounded by the Pentagon, Pepper missing the RT-charged heart that made her Rescue and Tony's Resilient team struggling to put their clean-energy tech into production, they're about to up the ante. Now, Iron Man's going to find out just what 'resilient' really means. Collecting INVINCIBLE IRON MAN #20-33.</i></p>",

Not knowing where to start, he turns to his new friends and collabrators for guidance. However, this poses a new problem. The world of wine is vast and is full of history. Where does a complete novice start? And with a co-worker who is madly obsessed with Italian wines, how will he ever find the proper perspective and direction needed to take on someone like the prince of wine criticism, Issei Tohmine?</i></p><p><i>To prepare himself Shizuku volunteers to participate in a unique wine tasting by one of Japan's up-and-coming wine traders and producers Saoin Wines. The same group that is funding Shizuku's rival Tohmine have established an event that showcases 100 unique wines together in a formal setting. This is a high-stakes wine event, where the most enjoyed wines will certainly be bought up at top dollar by the finest food and wine establishments of Asia. As a member of Taiyo Beers new Wine Sales Division, Shizuku must select the best wine at this event. And even if the labels are not the best known, he will have to trust his senses and his own judgement of taste to pick the one true wine worth sales on the market today.</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 19: Karma and Cuisine</li><li>Chapter 20: The Wine or the Cuisine</li><li>Chapter 21: Father and Daughter</li><li>Chapter 22: Passionate Gods Awaken</li><li>Chapter 23: Chablis and Oysters</li><li>Chapter 24: And the True Preparations Begin</li><li>Chapter 25: Quietly a New Round Opens</li><li>Chapter 26: Happening Across a Wonderful Gift</li><li>Chapter 27: The Necessity of French Wine</li><li>Chapter 28: Downtown Wine Brothers Blues</li><li>Chapter 29: Drink Daddy's Wine!</li><li>Chapter 30: Manly Tears!

Now he faces the most difficult decision of his life. Continue to put his friends in harm's way…or abandon them for the safety of Toyo Harada's Harbinger Foundation?</i></p><h4>List of covers and their creators:</h4><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Cover</th><th scope=\"col\">Name</th><th scope=\"col\">Creator(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Sidebar Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reg</td><td>Regular Cover</td><td>Arturo Lozzi</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Var</td><td>Variant Cover</td><td>Doug Braithwaite</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>Second Printing Black-and-White Variant Cover</td><td>Arturo Lozzi</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Issue Recap</h3><p>Harbinger #2 opens up 10 years ago in Mumbai, India with <a href=\"/harada/4005-7182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7182\">Toyo Harada</a> and introduces the third self-activated psiot as a baby, <a href=\"/darpan-the-mirror/4005-85272/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85272\">Darpan</a>. His power is that he can conjure up your darkest memories and make you relive them fuller than they were in reality. When he attempts to use his power on Harada uncontrolled, Harada is able to fight through and overcome his power and see how wonderful he really is.</p><p>Back in present-day, soldiers of <a href=\"/project-rising-spirit/4060-59199/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59199\">Project Rising Spirit</a> are closing in on <a href=\"/peter-stanchek/4005-12460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12460\">Peter Stanchek</a>, <a href=\"/joseph-irons/4005-85260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85260\">Joseph Irons</a>, and <a href=\"/kris-hathaway/4005-58937/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58937\">Kris Hathaway</a>. PRS tries to dampen Peters powers by strobing the area with phase electromagnetic pulses. This has little effect on Peter, but when the soldiers grab Kris, he just loses it and knocks everybody out. The soldiers open fire on Peter, but it does no good because he can redirect the bullets. Through violence and maybe fear, Peter violently attacks the soldiers. Peter is shown to be extremely powerful when he locates <a href=\"/mr-tull/4005-85271/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85271\">Mr. Tull</a> and through telekinesis pulls the van he's in to his location with no struggle. Instead of killing him, he mind-wipes Mr. Tull all the way back to infancy.</p><p>After the fight, Peter is unable to turn off his powers without the help of Harada, currently projecting himself as a dog. Harada then pulls Peter into his mind telepathically to help him get control. It's here that Harada explains who Mr. Tull is and who he works for. Harada is the only other person that Peter has met with psionic abilities at this point and he is extremely powerful. So, when Harada offers to take him in and train him, he accepts.</p><p>Harada sends in his recruitment team made up of <a href=\"/rachel-hopson/4005-85316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85316\">Rachel Hopson</a> and Edward Sedgewick to pick up Peter, Joe, and Kris to escape the scene. Before Harada leaves, he mind wipes all the witnesses. Shortly after the van drives off, it stops and Peter has to separate from Joe and Kris to leave and begin his training. This includes releasing Kris from the mind control that Peter has on her. After doing so, she freaks out and violently wants to hurt Peter for what he has done. After the intense night, Joe, in disbelief that Peter is really leaving him, tells Peter that he is the most terrifying person he has ever known. Peter then drives off to join the <a href=\"/harbinger-foundation/4020-58012/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-58012\">Harbinger foundation</a>.</p>",

Shuichi spends a precious gift of cash from his grandmother on a special present for himself, a purchase that triggers a chain of events in which his sister Maho learns his secret, and Shuichi inadvertently steals the heart of a boy Maho in interested in.</i></p><p><i>The woman who showed so much interest in Yoshino (when she was wearing a boy’s school uniform) in Volume One reappears with her boyfriend, and, after discovering the important secret they have in common, becomes a mentor and friend to the two children. And the kids go on a class trip that is a rite of passage Shuichi would rather pass up. Shuichi is called a “faggot” by another boy, and the dramatic nature in which Saori comes to Shuichi’s defense leads the two to discover a shared fondness for Anne of Green Gables. But despite his propensity to cry (a propensity noted repeatedly by his more outgoing sister), Shuichi finds strength and courage he didn’t know he had.</i></p><p><i>A sophisticated work translated with sensitivity by veteran translator and comics scholar Matt Thorn.</i></p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li>Love &amp; (Hair)piece</li><li>Dreams and Desires and Stuff</li><li>An Unfortunate Boy</li><li>An Undaunted Girl</li><li>The Exchange Diary</li><li>An Odd Pair</li><li>School Trip: The Day Before</li><li>School Trip: Day 1</li><li>School Trip: Day 2</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><span id=\"intelliTXT\"><i>Fine artist, illustrator, and comics creator Molly Crabapple captures the absurdity of modern life in intricate, theatrical detail in her fine art work, drawing inspiration from politics, polite (and not-so-polite) society, and hundreds of years of literature. Her work is burlesque-inspired in the broadest definition of the word—deftly satirizing the powerful with adorably sinister animals, steampunk-tinged machinery, and of course, beautiful girls.</i></span></p><p><span id=\"intelliTXT\"><i>But it's not all fantastical—when Occupy Wall Street broke out, Molly was there, capturing the immediacy of the revolutionary feeling in pen and ink. In a new 48-page book from IDW, you can get Molly's art in gorgeous full-color, work that's decorated glamorous nightclubs, museums and galleries, and protest signs and occupied spaces around the country.</i></span></p>",

Would that be FUN for you?</i></p><p><i>The Merc with a Mouth takes a turn for the twisted in a weekly horror comic like no other…</i></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The book starts with Deadpool his killing heroes and villains alike. A newscaster reviews the terror that has been going on since book and we can see corpses of Ghost Rider, Doctor Doom and Howard the Duck. She stops to think and questions if anyone can stop him.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The scene changes to a fight with Spider-Man and Deadpool fighting above the streets of New York City. Spidey kicks Deadpool off of him and he crashes onto a Yellow Taxi Cab. He heals quickly, gets up and walks over to Spider-Man. He pulls out his gun and shoots Spidey in the head.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He walks away from the scene and the new voice tells him to take things slowly. Deadpool does not listen and decides to go for something huge. In the Avengers Mansion, the Avengers call a meeting and the current roster, including reserve members are as follows; Captain America, Ms. Marvel, Thor, Spider-Woman, Luke Cage, Wolverine and Iron Man. Jarvis runs into the room and tells them that Ant-Man is gone. He recalls him being in his labs worried about missing Pym Particles.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Wolverine sniffs the air. And tells the team that something bad is about to happen. Bombs grow to full size on the table along with the body of Hank Pym and the mansion explodes. Deadpool is among the rubble playing with Ant-Man’s helmet and kills Luke with bombs he snuck into the coffee and smashed Thor with an oversized Mjölnir he grew with the last batch of Pym Particles.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Deadpool then goes to the Grand Canyon where Hulk easily dismembers him. Hulk walks away into a cave and, while asleep, turns into Banner. Deadpool Cuts off his head. Later, family members of heroes hire Taskmaster to kill Deadpool.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>World War II has ended, and with so many pilots mustered out at the end of the war, jobs for pilots are hard to find, and Buz’s record as a “hot-shot” pilot does not recommend him to commercial airlines. While looking for a job, Buz visits his old alma mater and spends time with glamorous Tot Winter and girl-next-door Christy Jameson. He finally finds the perfect job as a troubleshooter for International Airways, flying to trouble spots all over the world.</i></p><p><i>He encounters Sultry, the beautiful and dangerous woman he met on a Japanese-held island during the war, with fatal results for a major character in the strip. He travels to the arctic to stop the Mad Baron, an insane ex-Nazi trying to shoot down International Airways planes. And, in the only adventure to combine the daily and Sunday story lines, he teams up with his old pal Roscoe Sweeney to discover a fabulous ancient Mayan treasure. This book reprints the Sunday pages from this adventure in full color for the first time.</i></p><p><i>In the last adventure in our 2nd volume, Buz is kidnapped and flown to Africa by mysterious assailants. His friend Chili Harrison bets International Airways chief Mr. Wright $200 that even in this desperate situation, Buz will manage to get involved with a pretty girl. Long-time readers of the strip will have no trouble guessing who wins that bet.</i></p><p><i>Comic strip historian Brian Walker wrote, “<b>Buz Sawyer</b> combined fast-paced adventure stories…with authentically illustrated military equipment and real locations, which Crane researched during trips around the world.”</i></p><p><i>Roy Crane’s drawing and storytelling skills just get better and better. With this volume’s Buz reprints from 1945 to 1947, Crane hit his stride.</i></p>",

This volume also features ten of Barks's smart and funny 10-pagers, including a double whammy of yarns co-starring Donald's insufferable cousin (\"Gladstone’s Usual Very Good Year\" and \"Gladstone’s Terrible Secret\"), as well as another nine of Barks's rarely seen one-page Duck gags… all painstakingly recolored to match the original coloring as exactly as possible, and supplemented with an extensive series of notes and behind-the-scenes essays by the foremost Duck experts in the world.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Dead former United States presidents, from George Washington to Gerald Ford have been resurrected, and that’s BAD. The Marvel heroes can’t be the ones to stop them, someone is needed with the reputation, skills and plausible deniability to take out these com-monsters in chiefs...NOW! is the time for Deadpool… In Wade We Trust!</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>On a beach... somewhere... Deadpool basks in the sun with a mighty headache. Sue Storm appears and offers him a beer to help with the head pain Abe Lincoln gave him moments before. Emma Frost then appears and the two ladies start fighting over who gets Deadpool's attention. He watches with glee, though states that he's got plenty to give both of them. Dazzler, looking superfly on roller skates, rolls up and invites Deadpool for a skate-date. He agrees but is saddened when She-Hulk kicks Dazzler into the sea. She-Hulk then picks up Deadpool and kisses him. (Sue wins the fight.)</p><p>Deadpool wakes up in Independence Hall to see the ghost of Benjamin Franklin celebrating his ability to wake up Deadpool. Deadpool springs into action and tries to kill Ben. Franklin has to explain to the Canadian merc that he was never a president. He simply figured out a way to electronically keep himself on Earth. He also explains that he is there to offer aid.</p><p>At a military graveyard, dead presidents George Washington and John F. Kennedy try to coerce the hippie-magician into raising an army for their razing of the United States. The magician has second thoughts, however, and tries to flee after throwing JFK and blowing fire at George Washington (wooden teeth!). Turning invisible and hiding, he is shamed into revealing himself when the presidents use killing two old people as leverage for the hippie's help. He gives in and summons the dead military men to rise.</p><p>Deadpool calls in to Agent Preston and explains that the situation may be a bit worse than thought. He also mentions that Ben Franklin is helping him (she can't see him). She decides to get personally involved and tells him to standby for transport to Los Angeles to stop Theodore Roosevelt from killing zoo animals.</p><p>In L.A., Teddy Roosevelt continues his hunt. A bear approaches and knocks his gun out of his hands. No worries, Roosevelt punches the bear for a loop and heads back for his gun. In the air, Deadpool jumps from a plane and lands very awkwardly in the zoo. He approaches Roosevelt and shoots him in the head. Seeing that as a sign of aggression, Roosevelt pummels Deadpool. Ben Franklin shows up as Deadpool dusts himself off and tells him that electricity should be the answer in getting rid of the dead presidents. An elephant charges before Ben can elaborate and pierces Deadpool with a tusk through his abdomen. Deadpool and Roosevelt exchange shots while Deadpool tries to work himself free from the elephant. The two men then fight on the ground (Deadpool's guts still hanging out) until the elephant grabs Roosevelt by the head. Deadpool punches him in the nads for good measure. He then sees an electrical box and grabs a very large cord with exposed wires. He orders the elephant to drop Roosevelt before zapping the president. The elephant doesn't understand, however, and gets electrocuted too. Agent Preston shows up to see the elephant burning and laments that they may need more help.</p><p>In Manhattan, Deadpool, Preston, and Franklin approach the home of Dr. Strange. Wong immediately turns them away.</p>",

The sailors see a figure in the fog and it turns out to be the God Butcher, following them. They land on the shores of Neva River and Thor asks the people there for their gods. They don't react very friendly but then one god's horse comes down without him, spattered in blood. Thor follows the blood trail, encounters another dead god. Then the God Butcher confronts him and they fight. Thor remembers that, as a child, a god named Dagr went on a killing spree until he was executed by Odin. Thor is haunted by the face of Dagr for a long time afterwards. The fight continues until Thor hits the God Butcher with lightning.</p><p>The Present Day: Thor has defeated the God Butcher's servants and swears to find him by following the trail of dead gods.</p>",

Written by Matt Wagner, award-winning creator of Grendel and Mage, and created by Thomas Tull, executive producer of 300 and The Dark Knight, this is the next compelling chapter in the tale of John Tower, a supernatural bounty hunter who tracks down the horrifying nightmares that plague our unsuspecting world. Following the close of the 'Piranha Killer' affair, we find Tower reluctantly enduring the 'assistance' of FBI agent Alicia Hardwicke, whose cynicism quickly dissipates once she witnesses his terrifying ordeals. Now, united in Tower's quest, they travel the globe together and into the darkest recesses of mankind's most dangerous places to vanquish a multitude of demonic manifestations and unfathomable evils - all to free his troubled patrons from their tormentors' unearthly grasp. Illustrated by acclaimed 2000AD and Lobo artist Simon Bisley, with second issue cover art by industry legend Alex Ross, this is Volume Two in the first Book of a graphic novel trilogy, serialized bi-monthly in four deluxe prestige editions. Each volume of this spectacular epic features cover art by one of comics' most notable talents.</i></p>",

You will be thrilled, chilled and maybe even a little sickened by the over-the-top ghouls and gore in the thick 52 page Haunted Horrors. From the fiends that brought you Dick Briefer's Frankensten, Bob Powell's Terror and Zombies in the Chilling Archives of Horror Comics. Grab Haunted Horror before some do-gooders ban it!</i></p>",

Now its his move!</i></p><p><i>It takes more than bullets to take out the Avengers' biggest guns.</i></p><p>On Ryker's Island, Rachel is visited by Kelly Grafton, a representative of N.C.T.A.P., an organisation that fights against the death penalty, which Rachel is possibly facing. Rachel is not interested, but Grafton goes on, telling her that it is crucial to find Frank Castle to get a testimony from him, proving her innocence. Rachel again refuses to tell anything, both protecting Castle and taking the guilt on her shoulders.</p><p>In the Avengers Tower Black Widow tells Wolverine about her visit to the prison as Kelly Grafton. She also found out that his story about his encounter with Castle was a lie. She then sets out to find Castle herself.</p><p>She goes to the Ukraine and is told what the Punisher has been up to since he arrived in Eastern Europe. In Moldova he stops a shipment of girl slaves, then continues to Amsterdam to kill the pimp responsible for the trade. Her contact suggests to let Castle do his thing, but she wants to stop him.</p><p>She travels through Europe and Africa, following his trail of bodies. In Niger she finds his victims of an ivory operation, in the Congo she is betrayed by her guides and defeats them. She is then attacked by Castle and gets him to talk to her. They fight some more and he escapes to a village in the jungle.</p><p>Natasha tells Captain America that the village Castle led her to is full of sick children who need help. She questions if Castle should be pursued further, but Cap insists on it, now trying his luck with Thor.</p>",

Ant-Man and She Hulk watch a clock for four minutes straight and realize that the Fantastic Four is not coming back as scheduled.</p><p><strong>Day Two</strong>: The Future Foundation awakes to a newspaper article describing Ant-Man, the new leader of the new Fantastic Four, as an ex-con. Things get a little tense for the new leader, but he is able to explain his past to the children's satisfaction.</p><p><strong>Day Three</strong>: Artie and Leech find Darla on the roof and she explains that she is simply watching the portal for the Fantastic Four's return. She accompanies the two to a the room with the machine that says \"Boop Boop\" and meets with Dragon Man. He shows her a display of the portal (or Chronostellar Manifold) and what it should do if the Fantastic Four returns. They monitor some action, but not from the portal. The activity seems to be coming from beneath the Earth.</p><p>Outside, Mole Man attacks. Ant-Man puts his team into action: She-Hulk is to subdue the giant creature Mole Man is riding, Medusa (who was still in bed and is not quite dressed yet) is to help any in-danger civilians, and Ant-Man shrinks to take on Mole Man. Inside, Dragon Man talks Darla into joining the fight by introducing her to the Thing's old Thing suit. She puts it on and exits the building just in time to see She-Hulk beat the crap out of the Mole Man's monster, Medusa save some civilians, and Ant-Man to knock Mole Man down (with his staff falling and blasting She-Hulk's very expensive suit).</p><p><strong>Day Four</strong>: Another newspaper comes out that bashes the new Fantastic Four team. Darla has had enough and expresses her desire to leave the team largely because she is useless. After she leaves the building the machine that says \"Boop Boop\" begins calling out. Ant-Man notices the four yellow kids missing and he rallies everyone to begin looking for them and to discover the meaning of all the boops. Alex Power notices an opening at the Chronostellar Manifold and the group makes its way to the roof.</p><p>On the roof, the Future Foundation witnesses the Human Torch return to Earth by himself. Acting erratically, the Human Torch blasts the gates holding the portal open and shouts that anyone following him won't ever be able to kill him. He finally lands on the Baxter Building roof and cryptically explains that the Fantasitc Four are dead.</p>",

New arrivals include Tammanany the Tiger, the voluble P.T. Bridgeport, the sinister Sarcophagus MacAbre (with his funereal speech balloons), Uncle Antler the bull moose... and Bewitched, Bothered, and Bemildred, the adorable trio of bats.</i></p><p><i>The two years of daily strips in this volume (all the strips from 1951 and 1952) have been collected before but in now long out of print books; and even there they were not as meticulously restored and reproduced as in this new series. <b>Bona Fide Balderdash</b> also reprints, literally for the first time ever in full color, the two full years of Sunday pages, also carefully restored and color-corrected, shot from the finest copies available.</i></p><p><i>This second volume is once again edited and designed by the cartoonist’s daughter, Carolyn Kelly, who is also handling much of the restoration work. It includes a new introduction by the legendary author, recording artist, and satirist Stan Freberg, who was not only a friend of Kelly’s but the voice of Albert the Alligator in the <b>I Go Pogo: Pogo for President</b> movie. There are also more extensive annotations by comic strip historian and expert R.C. Harvey, as well as additional historical information from writer Mark Evanier.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>10th Muse originated at Image Comics, quickly becoming the 6th highest selling comic during its release. This critically acclaimed series, written by famed Marvel/DC writer Marv Wolfman, takes Greek mythology to a new level. Greek mythology has documented the nine Muses, the inspirational daughters of the almighty Zeus. But history forgot one-- the Tenth Muse. Emma, Brett, and Dawn were the best of friends-- until Emma disappeared, leaving only a note saying goodbye. Now, eight years later, Emma is back, without answers. What happened to Emma? What is her connection with Grayson Bishop and, most of all, how did ordinary Emma Sonnet become the mysterious TENTH MUSE? Introducing The Tenth Muse, a new kind of super-hero saga unlike anything you've ever seen before. A mystery. An action series. A character-driven saga that will bring you to the edge of your seat. See if you can unravel the mystery of The 10th Muse. We apologize for the blurred cover image, but there is a new celebrity modeling as the Tenth Muse, and it has to be kept a secret until she makes it public!</i></p><p><b>Note</b>: The print edition will be released by Arcana Comics.</p>",

Written by Ryan Sohmer (Least I Could Do, Looking For Group), Gutters is a series of standalone pages that parody the comic book industry and the heroes and characters that dwell within. Each page is penciled, inked and colored by a different artist, varying from the industry veteran to the newcomer. Volume 2 is an over-sized full color (and glossy) printed book. With a cover by Tim Sale (Batman, Deathblow, Grendel) and a forward by Chuck Dixon (Batman, Conan, Detective Comics), this is a book you don't want to miss adding to your store.</i></p>",

Steve re-engages with Copper Calhoon, encounters Chinese warlords such as Serge Blu, spies like Madame Lynx, and joins a secret air force from?Western democracies taking on thinly disguised communists. In the midst of all this intrigue, Happy meets his Hooligans, Reed Kimberly falls head over heels for Princess Snowflower, and Steve learns that the end of the 1940s may be the best years of their lives.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The second volume of a gothic thriller whodunnit series set in the Age of the Saints, following on from volume 1 The Ogham Sacrifice. The mystery of murdered monks deepens for the druid Gwynlan, murders perpetrated because of their involvement with a venerated druid manuscript indicating the location of the hidden Treasures of the Britons – the Cauldron of Rebirth and the Spear of Lugh. The Church’s brutal agents, the Holy Vengeance, are intent on usurping the druids’ secrets and using them to undermine the old Celtic religion. They are on Gwynlan’s trail as his investigation leads him from Armorica across the sea to Britain. There, Gwynlan comes under the protection of the enigmatic hero, Arthur. But close to the mighty stones of the Giant’s Dance (Stonehenge), Gwynlan faces mortal danger. Will he and his companions reach the druids’ centre of religion on the sacred isle of Môn (Anglesey)?</em></p><p>The Holy Vengeance, the church's brutal agents, are trying to undermine the pagans by stealing their secrets. Meanwhile the last Druid Gwynlan continues to investigate the murder of monks which seems related to their reading an old Celtic text that just might hold the secret to an old Briton treasure.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>BATTLEFIELDS: HAPPY VALLEY TPB by Garth Ennis and PJ Holden</em></p><p><em>England, January 1942: young Australian Ken Harding arrives at his first operational squadron, keen to play his part in the aerial attack on Germany as the commander of a bomber crew. Losses have been high and life expectancy is low, but Ken remains undaunted- until he meets his crew, a foulmouthed, battle-hardened bunch with no time for new boys who can't stand the pace. Together, they must take the war to the enemy over the most heavily-defended region of the Third Reich- the industrial heartland of the Ruhr, known to the men who face the flak and nightfighters as Happy Valley.</em></p><p><em>BATTLEFIELDS FIRELFY &amp; HIS MAJESTY By Garth Ennis and Carlos Ezquerra</em></p><p><em>The Tankies' Sergeant Stiles returns, recently promoted and angrier than ever! He's got a new crew and a new tank - a Sherman Firefly with a high-velocity gun capable of taking out even the fearsome German Tiger. Too bad the enemy have a new tank of their own - the mighty King Tiger, with twice the armor and firepower of the original. As Stiles and his men join the Allied advance into the Nazi homeland, they soon realize that every inch of ground will be bitterly contested by the foe... and that there are worse horrors than Tigers lurking in the gloom of the last German winter.</em></p><p><em>BATTLEFIELD: MOTHERLAND By Garth Ennis and Russ Braun </em></p><p><em>Lieutenant Anna Kharkova is posted to single-seat fighter aircraft and sent straight into action. Hardened and embittered by the loss of her comrades, Anna is only too keen to get her teeth into the enemy- but with Russian and German armies about to collide in the titanic battle of Kursk, her first flight with her new squadron may well be her last. And once the Soviet secret police start sniffing around, death in battle may well be preferable anyway. Soon horrific losses land Anna with the very last thing she wants: more responsibility, in the shape of eight young replacement pilots to be trained for combat. But with the Battle of Kursk reaching its climax, rookies are nothing but lambs to the slaughter- and even the most experienced pilots find themselves flying on borrowed time. The former Night Witch meets her destiny, as Motherland- and the second series of Battlefields- conclude with a bang.</em></p><p><em>This massive 200+ Page Hardcover Edition also features bonus materials such as sketches and commentary from Ennis along with a complete cover gallery by series cover artist Garry Leach! Recommended for Mature Readers.</em></p>",

Souichiro sure thinks that enough for them to worry about. However, there seems to be more than seven mysteries. Not even Itsuki knows how many there may actually be, or when they might pop up and suck them into another dimension. On top of all that, there are the mysteries that come to visit on their own. First, there is the new school doctor who turns out to be a flesh eating demon with family problems. And then, there is the ghost of a little girl chasing the ghost of a little kitten. Somehow, they are connected to the teacher that's gone berserk and keeps chasing Love Club members with a broom. As Souichiro is in a near constant battle for his life and dodging the affections of all the wrong guys, he often wonders why his mother, world famous psychic, Souko Hino, thought this school was a good idea!</em></p><p>Chapter Five - Seven and LOVE CLUB SPECIAL DEAR MY FRIEND.</p>",

L'avenir ne se conjugue qu'entre de nouvelles tragédies. Pourtant, Sam et la caravane de bateaux menée par Lapointe ne perdent pas espoir. À chaque fois qu'ils tuent un zombie ou qu'ils sauvent une vie, ils entretiennent le rêve d'un monde nouveau... Mais une rumeur silencieuse, affamée et mortelle vient vers eux, une nation de morts est en marche. Les zombies ne rôdent plus sans but, ils semblent animés d'une volonté unique et avancent tous dans la même direction. Celle des survivants.</em></p><p><em>97 % MORT - 2 % VIVANT - 1 % NE SE PRONONCE PAS (ENCORE)</em></p>",

Aber Rin gibt nicht auf. Er hat beschlossen, ein Exorzist zu werden und Satan zu bekämpfen. Doch bis es so weit ist, muss er erst mal die Schulbank drücken und mit seinen Mitschülern klarkommen. Exorzist wird man nämlich nicht einfach so. Auch dann nicht, wenn man Rin heißt und der Lehrer an der Akademie zugleich der kleine Bruder ist.</em></p>",

But with the Second World War raging, it became clear there was only one hero who could headline a book titled U.S.A.: Captain America!

Bucky, Toro and their gang protect America on the homefront and on the front line in giant 40-plus-page adventures that burst off the page with action and excitement. Traveling across the country and around the globe, the Young Allies fight Hitler's Hollywood infiltrator the Owl, the South American Ambassador of Terror, the North African Nazi Wehrmact and the fiendish Whip. Backed-up by the time-traveling Tommy Tyme and humorous Norman the Doorman, the Golden Age classics in this volume are not to be missed!</em></p><p><em>Collects Young Allies (1941) #5-8.</em></p>",
