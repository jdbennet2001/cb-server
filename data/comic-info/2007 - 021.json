And when this fight’s over… Not everyone is coming back!</p><p>Wolverine and the newly named Armor arrive to meet with Scott, Emma, Hank, and Abigail at the ancient mural of Colossus crushing Breakworld.  Wolverine tells them how Abigail's plan didn't go so well.  He asks if they get through this mission, can he pop a claw through her eye.  Emma says absolutely.  Scott begins to say no, but then tells him to go for it.  They need to decipher the symbols around the mural and need more information.  They also need to find Kitty and Peter.  It's decided that they will split up.  Abigail says she wants Hank to go with her to deal with the \"science.\"  Wolverine says he'll take Armor to find Pete and Kitty.  Scott wants to confront Powerlord Kruun but Abigail says that isn't a good idea since he's depowered and Emma isn't too stable.  She says they should meet up with her men in the field.</p><p>As Kitty and Peter fight among the locals that simply want him dead, they finally are able to put them off.  Making an escape out a back door, another local recognizes them and asks for them to trust him and accompany him.</p><p>Danger tries to make a deal with Kruun.  She says she can kill the X-Men and that they have that common goal.  He finally agrees because the weapon aimed at Earth needs to be protected.<br /></p><p>Scott and Emma fly in a ship to meet the SWORD agents.  They finally start talking over the recent events during an attack in the sky.  Emma is a little bitter.  Scott tells her she doesn't get it.  He's in love with her.</p><p>Kitty and Peter are brought to a \"care center\" facility.  It turns out helping the wounded and honoring the dead or weak is the closest thing they have to committing a sin.  They do not necessarily believe in the prophecy that Colossus will destroy the world.  They believe that perhaps, he will re-form a world that is in chaos.  Kitty and Peter are offerred a place to rest for the night.  In their room, Kitty takes advantage of the time alone.</p><p>Beast and Abigail lose contol of their vehicles after Kruun has set a snowstorm upon them to safeguard the weapon.  Landing in the snow, they must seek shelter as the temperature begins to drop.  Beast is concerned that she is looking at him as if he were a taun-taun.  Abigail tells him to relax.  She has another way to keep warm.</p><p>Scott and Emma have defeated all the attackers.  Emma still hasn't spoken since Scott professed his feelings.  She finally says she's sorry.  Scott is surprised to hear those words come from her.  He then asks what she's sorry for, being mean, that they ever met,...  Before he can go on, they are hit by Danger.  The ship is down.  Emma is still conscious after changing into diamond form.  She pulls Scott from the wreckage.  Tears begin to stream down her face as she mentions that he said he loved her.  Danger approaches saying it's over.  Emma asks for one favor, to kill her and make it quick.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>BACK IN BLACK continues as Spidey finds one his oldest friends in the fight of her life. Could this be the end for Betty Brant!? Spidey vs the police.  Spidey vs Arrow.  Robbie vs Jameson?  All this and find out why Spidey's butt was buzzing.  Really.</p><p>Spider-Man sits in Flash's friend's truck, trying to figure out what to do after Arrow has taken him away.  A police officer has his gun pointed at Spider-Man, trying to tell him not to move.  Flash's cell phone goes off and it turns out to be Betty, trying to see if Flash is okay.  The officer still tries to get Spider-Man to raise his hands so he webs the gun.  Spider-Man tells her to stay where she is as they try to figure out where Arrow may have taken Flash.  He tells her that Arrow is literally made of supernatural spiders.  Meanwhile, the officer goes to the trunk of his squad car to get another gun.  Spidey notices this.  The cop tells him to give up because he's called for backup.  He goes off on how he would've loved to give up long ago so his loved ones wouldn't have been placed in danger.  He mentions how Captain America gave up and is dead now.  All of this was video taped by an onlooker.</p><p>In the church where Arrow's cocoon was, Flash is webbed to the ceiling.  Arrow is in pain as the time for her eggs to be born is approaching.  She pulls an egg sack from herself and mentions that Flash is to be their \"daddy.\"  Because Flash has been \"out of action,\" due to his coma, he has a lot of tantric energy built up inside.  When the eggs are ready to hatch, hundreds of beings like Arrow will be born.  The downside for Flash is that they will be eating their way out of him.  The egg sack has to go down his throat.  When he refuses to open his mouth, she threatens to rip off his lips and knock out his teeth if he doesn't cooperate.  Spider-Man arrives and they begin to fight.  Both of them begin using their stingers.<br/></p><p>At the Daily Bugle, a worker shows Jameson the video of Spider-Man and the officer that has been uploaded to U-tube.  Jameson is loving it.  He wants the guy responsible located for an exclusive interview.  Robbie comes and tells him \"No.\"  He says that Peter deserves a break.  He mentions all of his recent troubles including his aunt being in the hospital.  He says Captain America's death is partially Jameson's fault too with all his raving about masked menaces.  He asks how could he have been so blind over all these years.  There were so many \"coincidences\" with Peter and Spider-Man.  Deep down, he must have known, like he did, that Peter was Spider-Man.  He says the man on the screen is a co-worker and possibly even a friend.   He tells him for once not to add to his grief, but he is the \"boss\" so it's up to him.</p><p>Spider-Man is glad his stingers have come out at this time.  Arrow says they only appear when he faces someone that is \"rooted in primal forces of chaos and darkness.\"  When he lands a blow on her, it has little affect other than displacing some of the many spiders she is made of.  Arrow manages to get him in the shoulder.  She says the venom won't kill him outright but will slow him down. She has him on the ropes now.  She decides to place her eggs inside of him instead of Flash.  Even though only hundreds will be born rather than thousands, at least it will result in his death.    Lifting his masks, she prepares to force the egg sack down his throat.</p><p>Back at the Daily Bugle, Robbie walks into Jameson's office.  He apologizes for his outburst in front of everyone.  He says it was unprofessional and inappropriate.  Jameson simply tells him he's fired and to get out of his building.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview:</i></p><p>In a castle of ice in a far off land, a fearsome being called the Isolationist sits and waits and plans...except he need wait no longer. He is coming to Mutant Town, and is seeking out Jamie Madrox. But whether he and X-Factor will be enemies or allies pales in comparison to the shocking developments involving Guido's new job offer, Rictor's unexpected call to action, Siryn and Monet's new case, and--most stunning of all--Layla's disturbing discovery of something even she didn't know</p><p>Featuring \"Endangered Species Chapter 3\"</p><p><u>Issue Summary:</u></p><p><u>X-Factor #21:</u></p><p>Jamie Madrox sits at a table in the local bar known as the Power Plant, drinking from a sloppily poured drink. As he downs the last of what remains in his glass, avoiding the three ice cubes within, he ponders the word “Lonely.” Mockingly, he muses that it’s the state of being alone, from the Middle English, combining the words “all” and “one.” Kinda sucks when “one” and “all”… are the same. Interrupting this thought, as well as punctuating it, the dupe who also sits at the table wonders aloud if they two of them – both Jamie Madroxes – had… he knows… with each other, would that constitute actual… you know…</p><p>Regarding the dupe with an incredulous stare, the Madrox prime folds his arms and turns his head the opposite direction. Then again, he thinks, there’s something to be <i>said</i> for being alone. It’s a powerful emotion, though… loneliness. It’s not mankind’s natural state of being. They’re used to huddling together in groups… for mutual protection… for a sense of community… for warmth. Sure, there are about who prefer their solitude… hermits and such. But you have to think that living that way for an extended period… it can make you nuts.</p><p>Meanwhile, elsewhere on a frozen, wind-swept terrain, there exists a cave. Deep within its structure sits a man on a throne of ice. He is clad in black, form fitting clothes, except for a buckled leather belt, two armored shoulder plates and wrappings which cover where his boots connect with his lower legs. Likewise wearing black gloves, his entire body is covered save for the area shrouded by the black hood covering his face. From beneath that hood, his right eye flares with a crimson hue. Reclining on his frozen throne, he pleads for someone to go away. All of them, he then adds. Just shut up… for a few minutes… Is that… too much to ask?</p><p>However, though in truth the hooded man is alone, the chamber before him is filled with phantoms of a host of people. Male, female, young, old – of all shapes, creeds and types of dress. Their thoughts echo in the chamber in brief snippets. One pleads for their life, another worries if someone will call them, another worries about their job. All of these and more, the man attempts to remove from his mind. Leaving his throne, he walks to a cluster of boxes, one of which is already open. Removing a bottle of pills from one, he opens it and pours more than half a dozen into his palm. A moment later, the man tosses them down his throat. Slowly, the sound of the voices decreases more and more, until the man is alone in the vast and now empty chamber of ice.</p><p>At X-Factor’s building, Nicole asks Layla what she meant by “waiting for.” She means, Layla explains, that Nicole is looking out the window like she’s waiting to see something. Her palm pressed against the glass, Nicole stares wide-eyed at the landscape of lights beyond. She replies that Layla that she’s just… taking in the city. It’s… so <i>different</i> from Pairs.</p><p>To this, Layla rejoins that it’s not that different. The buildings, sure, but people… People are more alike than you’d think. When Nicole then begins to leave, Layla asks where she’s going. When she replies the bathroom, Layla reminds her to be sure to hold the toilet handle down. Otherwise stuff comes back up. Thanking her as she leaves, Nicole adds that it’s nice to know she’s watching out for her. No problem, Layla replies with a slight smile that promptly disappears once Nicole does. “Little creep,” she mutters.</p><p>Downstairs, Jamie Madrox sheepishly says “hi,” to Theresa and Monet, interrupting their respective book and magazine. Bluntly, each returns his greeting and then returns to their reading. Taking a moment to consider what this means, Jamie bites the bullet and asks if they are okay. The look he receives shows him otherwise. Hardly the look of love, he thinks. Jamie’s mind races. He tries to remember that they’re the injured parties. Dupe or not, bottom line, he two-timed them. He needs to remain cool. Everyone is an adult there and if they can just handle matters on a mature level…</p><p>“What the hell do you want from me, huh?” he suddenly yells. “I’m sorry okay!? I’m sorry! Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa!” Entering the room, oblivious to what he has walked into, Guido smiles innocently, asking what’s happening. He was watching TV upstairs, but this seems <i>far</i> more interesting.</p><p>Ignoring Guido, Jamie sits down on the couch and addresses Theresa and Monet again, though this time with a calmer demeanor. Apologetically, Jamie admits that he knows he screwed things up big time. He gets that. He can’t undo it. But he… He’s just trying to be honest. He misses them. He misses being <i>friends</i>. He misses feeling like they can count on each other.</p><p>To this, Theresa tells Jamie not to be ridiculous. They can still count on each other. If someone were… she doesn’t know… trying to shove a knife in his back, she’d stop him. And she knows Monet feels the same way, right, Monet? When Monet does not reply immediately, Theresa repeats her name inquisitively. Finally speaking up, Monet asks Jamie bluntly which of them was better in bed. As an astounded Theresa reels at this, Guido leans in to Jamie. “Danger, Will Robinson,” he whispers. “No kidding,” Jamie silently muses. Resolute, Monet presses on. She reminds Jamie that he said he wanted to be honest. She’s testing that. If he’s <i>honest</i> with her, she’ll forgive him.</p><p>Jamie Madrox does not immediately answer, but his thoughts speak to him. He realizes that Rictor said something to her. Even if he didn’t, she’s a telepath. She’ll be able to sense it. And if he’s honest, then Theresa will never speak to him again. Lord, please somebody bail him out…</p><p>Answering Jamie prayers, Rahne yells to Monet, asking how <i>dare</i> she. She heard what she was saying and… <i>echhh!!!</i> To this, Monet counters to Rahne, mocking that she’s weighing in like she’s the expert on sex. “Don’t make me laugh.” Angered further, Rahne counters that she knows more than she thinks. “How?” Monet smiles. Watching “after school specials?” Yelling for Monet to shut up, Rahne adds that she thinks it’s demeaning that she’s put Jamie on the spot like that. God as her witness, sometimes she doesn’t understand <i>any</i> of them.</p><p><i>All right, all right!</i> Monet yells, telling Rahne “down girl” like an animal. She’s got this dog-breath when she’s like that and it makes her… A sudden sensation of nausea coming over her, Monet’s hands begin to cover her mouth as she literally takes flight to the bathroom down the hall. Madrox, Guido, Rahne and Theresa, all dumfounded, peer down the hall from around the corner.</p><p>Elsewhere in Mutant Town, a door of light appears in the street, arcs of electricity emanating from its corners and sides. From within, the man clad in black appears, gusts of artic air wafting at his feet. However, the man’s random point of arrival is not one of good fortune, at least not for the driver of the tractor trailer that impacts upon him a moment later. Though unharmed himself, the man’s immovability crumbles the cab of the truck, causing its driver to fly through the windshield and impact on the pavement beyond. Taking a moment to regard the bleeding man, the man clad in black calls him an idiot… and then begins to shrink ever-so slightly. Nothing more to be said or done, he departs.</p><p>A short while later, the man finds himself standing outside X-Factor’s building, specifically in the alley beneath the bedroom in which Nicole is sleeping. Seemingly sensing his presence, she awakens and then looks out the window to find him staring up at her. Silently, they regard each other for a few moments, before a slight smile crosses her lips.</p><p>Elsewhere in the building, Rictor sits on his bed, his back against the wall and his arms crossed above his knees, which he has pulled close to his chest. He stares forward with eyes that do not seem to see. Entering the room, Rahne holds a tray with a plate and glass on it. She explains that the whole noise downstairs… turned out that Jamie, Theresa and Monet were having it out about… <i>he</i> knows… the whole sex thing.</p><p>When Rictor does not respond, she continues. Guess that’s the danger of relationships in the workplace, she opines. Believe her, <i>she’ll</i> never make <i>that</i> mistake. Again, no response. Anyway, she continues again, she thought she’d check back with him. Maybe get some food into him. He’s hardly had anything to eat today, so… And after what Quicksilver put him through… he needs to be building up his strength so she…</p><p>Finally responding, Rictor knocks aside the tray that Rahne was placing on the end of the bed, its contents, a BLT and glass of milk, onto the floor. Rather than becoming angry, Rahne becomes even more subdued, softly saying his name. When he tells her to leave him alone, his hands covering his eyes, she refuses. Looking up at her, Rictor’s eyes are filled with tears. <i>He had it back!</i> he tells her. Does she get that? His powers! In his grasp! He had hope! For the first time in… And it got trashed! There’s no hope for him! For <i>any</i> of them! It’s donoe! The whole mutant race, they’re finished. And he’s… He used to be a part of the Earth, and now he;s alone, and he can’t ever…</p><p>Sitting next to Rictor on the bed, Rahne places her hand on his shoulder and tells him it’s okay. It’s going to be okay. When he replies that it won’t, Rahne remains resolute, moving her arms around his shoulder and drawing closer. It will… she continues. She doesn’t know how but… he has to have faith. “Yer not alone, Ric… ye…” Her voice trailing, both of their lips meet in a slight kiss. When they part, Rahne and Rictor’s eyes meet briefly, their thoughts conveyed by expression. A moment later, they kiss again, this one more of passion than before. Again, they part, voicing their thoughts by their eyes.</p><p>Moving away, Rahne stands and walks to the door. She stands there a moment, her hand on the door… and then closes it. Walking back to the bed, she removes her shirt, wearing nothing but her sweat pants and a cross which dangles from her neck. Climbing atop him, Rahne begins to kiss Rictor passionately, which he returns in kind.</p><p>The next day, Guido meets Val Cooper at a local diner. He’s there, he says. What does she want? To this, Val mocks the bluntness. What, no swelling on old times? “Which old times?” he asks. The old times like the other day, when her people invaded Mutant Town? Or the older times when he was a government stooge and she was his boss? Hardly insulted, Val raises her eyebrows and asks back if <i>that</i> is how he sees the old days. She’s a little disappointed.</p><p>To this, Guido rejoins that, to tell the truth, he liked it better then. Asked what he means by “it,” he replies that “it” means that one could work as a superguy for the government and it was of your own free will… as opposed to be “licensed.” It’s only one short step from that to an enforced draft for superguys. When she replies that that would never happen, Guido replies that that’s how stuff that could never happen <i>happens</i>… ‘cause people are too busy saying it couldn’t.</p><p>Changing the mood of the conversation, a smiling waitress arrives at their table, asking with a “y’all” how the two are doing this morning. Replying that “we all” are fine, he asks the same back. “Terrific!” she replies. What can she get them to start. Val order a coffee, back, to which Guido follows with ordering a beer, whatever they have on tap. Asked by Val if it’s a little early in the morning to be drinking, Guido replies that he learned it from Jamie. He’s their noir expert, so he follows his lead.</p><p>Returning to their previous subject, Guido suggests that they cut to the chase. How much is she <i>offering</i> him? Taken aback, Val stammers for a moment before admitting that she’s impressed. How did he know? Arms crossed, Guido explains that she probably figured he’s the go-to guy for what she wants. When Val begins to admit he’s right, Guido adds that she also figures that since he’s done some skuzzy job in his time, he’d go for this. To this, Val replies that they are the O*N*E hadn’t thought of it as skuzzy but…</p><p>Interrupting, Guido angrily states that they want him to spy on X-Factor for them. What else would she call it? She figures he can be <i>bought</i>. Well, guess what, Ms. Cooper? It doesn’t matter how much money she’s got… Though Val tries to interrupt, Guido continues. ‘Cause there ain’t enough in the world t’make him spy on his pals, and if she thinks he’s just some blork who’d…</p><p>Finally getting a word in with a shout of his name, Val bluntly tells him that they want him to be sheriff! Still indignant, Guido continues his diatribe for another moment until Val’s words sink in. As his face contorts into confusion, so does his indignantly outstretched finger curl in uncertainty. Technically, Val continues, pressing her advantage, “sheriff” wouldn’t be his exact title. “Special deputy” is more accurate… Effectively, he’d be the head of law enforcement for the district. A moment later when the waitress returns with his beer, Guido sheepishly asks her to take it back and give him an OJ, would she? Thanks.</p><p>In his office at X-Factor HQ, Jamie is thanked by his guests for seeing them at short notice. To this, he tells Mr. and Mrs. Tyler than it’s no problem. When Mrs. Tyler then asks if it’s okay that they don’t have powers, Madrox replies of course. So many people were depowered that they shouldn’t feel…</p><p>Interrupting, Mr. Tyler explains that he and his wife, June… they never had powers. Charlie and her aren’t mutants, his wife adds. Not that there’s anything wrong with <i>being</i> a mutant, be then appends. Yes, she agrees. They know mutants don’t <i>choose</i> it. They’re just <i>born</i> that way. Smiling slightly incredulously, Theresa tells the couple that that’s… very <i>broadminded</i> of them.</p><p>Actually, folks, Madrox interjects, most of their clients <i>have</i> been just “regular” folks like them. Usually their cases have some connections to mutant concerns… Oh, their does, Mrs. Tyler interjects. It involves these two children, her husband adds, passing a photo of two children, a boy and a girl. Their grandkids. Molly and Wally… fraternal twins. On the other side of Madrox, Monet chimes in, guessing that they want them to beat up the parents for giving the kids rhyming names. Smiling slightly, Theresa asks her to knock it off.</p><p>Continuing their explanation, Mr. Tyler explains that they’re their girl Abby’s kids. They have to understand, Mrs. Tyler says. Abby wasn’t always this way. Things changed since she married Roy, Mr. Tyler then adds.</p><p>Confused, Theresa tells the couple that she’s not following… However, Madrox does slightly, announcing that he recognizes the kids. Where has he seen them…? Suddenly, remembering, he says that they are the “Purity Singers.” Taking another glance at the photo, Theresa asks if he means those kids who go around as part of the Purity Movement… Singing about the joy of a world without mutants, Madrox finishes. About how M-Day was God’s will and soon the last of them will be dead. Sounds charming, Monet quips. Do they perform <i>show tunes</i> as well?</p><p>To this, Mr. Tyler begins to beam, explaining that they actually have this wonderful Sondheim medley… When his wife then informs him that she thinks she was being sarcastic, Mr. Tyler looks away in embarrassment.</p><p>As she said, Mrs. Tyler says, rising from her chair. They didn’t raise their Abby to be so… so prejudiced, but then she married Roy and he brought her into this… this cult of hatred. There’s no other way to say it. They use the children for propaganda purposes… It’s terrible, and they told Abby so, so she cut them out of her life.</p><p>But… it’ <i>their</i> kids, Madrox reminds her. He’s not sure what they want them to do… Pulling a piece of paper from her purse, Mrs. Tyler explains that they sued for visitation rights, and the court granted them. But Abby and Roy just… just ignore the court order. And they move around the country so much, there’s not much that can be done to enforce it. In the end, it’s just paper and they… They need something for than paper, Mr. Tyler says. Someone to help them see their grandchildren. They need someone with some… muscle, he guesses he’d say. Maybe even undo some of the damage, Mrs. Tyler then adds. When she thinks of those beautiful children… alone in that… that <i>cult</i>… with no one to provide positive influence…</p><p>Accepting to papers, Madrox glances at them as he asks both “Ms. Cassidy” and “Ms. Saint-Croix” how they would like to get their hands dirty. After both reply affirmatively with a smile, he tells them to go to it. Laying hands on his shoulder, Theresa thanks her “boss,” followed by Monet telling him she appreciates it. Silently noting that that sounded sincere, Madrox wonders if there’s a chance of everything returning to normal – or at least as close to normal as anything ever is around there.</p><p>Elsewhere, Layla takes a bowl from the cabinet and fills it with cereal and fat free milk. She is joined by Nicole, who is holding a plastic bag containing something sealed within. Grasping the back with cleaning gloves, Nicole asks Layla if she remembers that thing she said about the toilet having trouble. When Layla replies between bites that she does, Nicole states that this morning she guesses someone else around there wasn’t paying attention, ‘cause something they flushed came back up. When Layla counter with a “so?” Nicole tells her that she put it in this plastic bag for her to look at. To this, Layla promptly drops her spoon into her bowl of cereal with a <i>plop</i>.</p><p>Turning to Nicole, Layla tells her she’s got to be kidding. Is being that <i>gross</i> a <i>French</i> thing? Why in God’s name would she want to look at… Seeing the object within the plastic bag, Layla’s demeanor changes as an “uh-oh” passes her lips. Holding it out, Nicole asks if it’s what she <i>thinks</i> it is. Told in turn that it depends on what she thinks it is, Nicole answers “a pregnancy test.” Yeah, that’s it, Layla replies. “And the little plus sign on it?” Nicole asks. It means, Layla rejoins, something <i>happening</i> that she doesn’t know about… and that’s <i>never</i> good.</p><p>Later, Jamie Madrox finds himself at the counter of a very empty Power Plant bar. Considering his bottle of beer, he notes that drinking early in the day… by himself… That’s probably not what would be considered good. But, hey… drinking alone is better than not drinking at all, right?</p><p>Suddenly, Madrox’s thoughts are interrupted by the voice of another, echoing his thoughts exactly. Immediately surmising the meaning, Madrox voices that the newcomer that read is mind, Mr.…? Huber, the man clad in back replies. Josef Huber. And they two of them, he then adds… they’re going to becomes great allies. They’re rather <i>alike</i> in a way. He’s always been… an isolationist. Being alone… it’s a terrible way to live… doesn’t he think?</p><p><b>\"Endangered Species Chapter 3\":</b></p><p>The frozen wind sweeping through his course fur, the Beast tells the knight of Wundagore that he walked all the way up this <i>mountain</i> to see the High Evolutionary. He’s not turning around until they’ve <i>talked</i>.</p><p>Yes, he is, the knight, a anthropomorphized Bengal tiger, replies. Otherwise, he – and those who travel with him – will die. In reply, the Beast asks the knight, as well as the others who flank her, whether they have <i>asked</i> their lord and master if he’s prepared to talk to him. He is the <i>creator</i>, the knight replies. And they have standing orders. How <i>long</i> do they think they’ll stand, the Beast retorts, if the X-Men decide to pay them a call? Bring them, she replies. They’ll see.</p><p>As his guides behind him begin to quake in fear, the Beast turns to their leader, Stanis. He instructs him to tell his men to turn around and begin the descent. He’ll be right behind them. Returning his attention to the knight, the Beast asks her if White Tiger was a relative of her by any chance. Replying that she was her blood-<i>sister</i>, the knight asks why. Now speaking through bared teeth, the Beast replies that she would have bitten off her own tongue before she threatened unarmed men.</p><p>Reeling at this for a moment, the knight’s shock turns to rage and she leaps at the Beast with a savage roar. The knight manages to draw first blood, slashing the Beast’s shoulder with her claws, and then topples him onto his back. Perched atop him, the Beast at the edge of a crag of rock, the knight snarls that the Beast impugns her honor. She’ll write his epitaph with his own entrails. To this, the Beast suggests that she let him help her with that… He follows his quip with a right cross, followed by a left. “Big <i>M</i>, little <i>C</i>.</p><p>Before the startled knight can mount a counter attack, a voice rings out over the frozen terrain, calling “enough.” A moment later, the armored visage of the High Evolutionary appears bfore the Beast and the assembled knights. Addressing the knight as “Snow Queen,” he orders her to stop this now and to tell her knights to stand down. They are to let Doctor McCoy’s <i>companions</i> depart in peace. They’ll talk alone.</p><p>A short while later, the Beast is escorted into the laboratory of the High Evolutionary. Addressing him as Professor Wyndham, the Beast apologizes for his trespass on his privacy. However, the urgency of the situation has played all kinds of hell with his manners. Glancing back from his experiment which currently focuses his attention, the High Evolutionary asks the Beast if reminding him of his <i>human</i> name is part of a deliberate strategy. He is the <i>Evolutionary</i> now. Wyndham is a fading memory.</p><p>Changing subjects, the Evolutionary asks the McCoy to state his purpose, a request with which the Beast immediately complies. The mutant rate, he begins, his race, is about to become <i>extinct</i>. There are only two hundred of them left. If <i>anyone</i> knows how to remedy the situation, he tells the Evolutionary, he’d say it was him.</p><p>Assuming that were true, the Evolutionary replies, why would he <i>wish</i> to remedy it. Extinction has its place in the natural scheme of things. To this, McCoy asks if they are talking in cliché now. He thought he’d stick to English, if the Evolutionary doesn’t mind. Wanda Maximoff, he continues, reshaped reality by a single act of will. Using chaos magic – which isn’t exactly a <i>natural</i> process.</p><p>To this, the Evolutionary counters that it’s no <i>tragedy</i>. Nobody died, beyond a few unfortunate souls. No, the Beast admits, but lives were <i>ripped</i> out of their courses. Their futures were <i>stolen</i> from them. They’ve become an irrelevance. The cauterized <i>stump</i> of a species. And might not Wanda Maximoff, the Evolutionary couonters, still be the agent through which nature acts? Like the comet that destroyed the dinosaurs, like the great plague, or the sundering of continents?</p><p>Fangs bared in anger, the Beast retorts that she was a tortured woman who carried the burden of a terrible power. What spoke through her wasn’t nature, or fate, or God, or anything else. It was just her own suffering. Moving his hand forward in frustration, the Beast’s hand passes through the Evolutionary’s body. Cursing, he announces that he’s not even <i>there</i>, is he? That’s how little this <i>means</i> to him! He is elsewhere, the Evolutionary admits. And occupied with many things. But he’s monitored his research, he tells the Beast. And he cannot see it leading to success.</p><p>As the Evolutionary turns back to his project, the Beast’s demeanor turns more conciliatory. If he had the answers already, he admits, he wouldn’t have come. But he needs more than that. What is he doing wrong? Aiming at the flames perhaps, the Evolutionary replies. Treating the symptoms. Barking his reply, the Beast counters that he’s not interested in poetic metaphors. Tell him <i>straight</i>. What should he do? What should he be looking at? Where would <i>he</i> start?</p><p>His first though would be to go to the source, the Evolutionary replies. But that is impossible there. And, since magic <i>created</i>, the crisis, science may not avail to end it.</p><p>As the Snow Queen comes to lead the Beast away, he asks if that’s all the Evolutionary has to offer him. It’s better to stay where you are, he replies, than to embark on grand voyages to all the wrong destinations. That’s what he told his <b>colleague</b>, when he came there. But, like him, he found the truth unacceptable. Confused, the Beast asks what colleague. What is he talking about?</p><p>Ignoring him, the Evolutionary instructs Snow Queen to see Doctor McCoy to the outer gates. His business with him is concluded. As the image of the Evolutionary disappears, the Beast yells to him that he was a man once. And he’s not a god yet, even if he <i>thinks</i> he is. <i>Help</i> them! If he’s got anything at all that he can use… Interrupting, the knight accompanying Snow Queen pleads with Doctor McCoy, reminding him that his audience is over. The subsequent walk to the outer gates is in silence.</p><p>Once the Beast has passed through the force field of the outer gate and is once more in the frozen world beyond, the Snow Queen speaks again. She tells him that life is <i>lent</i> to them for as long as they’re fit to receive it. And those who can’t <i>adapt</i>, perish. When sarcastically asks back if that’s a fact, she replies that it is. It is a fact.</p><p>As he walks away, he final words cling to the Beast. “Wherever you go in the world, you walk on the bones of dead races… crumbled into <i>dust</i>.”</p>",

Cap says he is a figment of Tony's imagination, and tells him the writing he saw in the asylum was Makluan. Later, Stark tells Kooning that the writing proves the Mandarin is involved. Kooning insists the Mandarin is dead, but Stark is unwilling to be dissuaded, recounting his findings regarding Najeeb and Faraz's hunt for ten rings, and hypothesizing that Mandarin's real goal is to get hold of Extremis.

            "description": "<p><em>This is it - one of the biggest mysteries of Ms. Marvel's life is revealed. The march to Ms. Marvel's record-breaking issue #25 begins here as Brian Reed (NEW AVENGERS: ILLUMINATI) and Aaron Lopresti (INCREDIBLE HULK) take Carol Danvers to Monster Island where the very fate of the planet Earth - possibly the galaxy - hangs in the balance.</em></p><p><em>Backup Story</em></p><p>Captain Marvel #1 Preview</p><p>The introduction begins with Ms. Marvel and her thoughts. She thinks that the Cru was dead, but she comments how she has been wrong before. The both of them fight. The Cru has a gun that’s capable of evaporating a human being, but Ms. Marvel has the power of energy blasts, capable of ripping right through the Cru itself. During the fight, Ms. Marvel comments on how everything at her place is destroyed, except her phone. Three messages come through.</p><p>Ms. Marvel then gets her back stabbed by one of the Cru’s tentacles and she is paralysed. Agent Sum breaks through and runs for the Cru, however, the gun fires on Agent Sum and he becomes a pile of bone. Machine Man steps in, commenting on how impressive the Cru’s gun is, but he says that his is more impressive. He then realises that his gun isn’t impressive at all, and his body is destroyed and all that’s left is his right arm, his upper body and head. Agent Sum and Machine Man get to his room to repair him straight away.</p><p>Meanwhile, Carol Danvers is in Monster Island, and is dropping through the air, but she can’t fly! She can’t change into her Ms. Marvel costume either. She falls into a river, and the Cru introduces her, but in human form. Carol asks why her powers are gone. Cru attempts to have a conversation with Carol, but all she can think about is how she almost killed her and Earth. Carol breaks herself off with Cru, but she warns that if she does, the link will be broken, but Carol doesn’t listen. She realises that her back as healed, and for some reason, there are palm trees in New York. She then stumbles upon Cru, in the horrid alien form, and then something is racing through the palm trees. Something big. Carol readies herself and remembers that she can’t use her powers.</p><p>In Minicarrier 13, Mobile HQ for Lightning Storm, Anya, otherwise known as Arana is looking for Carol’s cat. In the same place, Agent Sum is repairing Machine Man. Anya runs into the room in which Machine Man is getting repaired and gets shocked by the appearance of Machine Man, all undone. Agent Sum, who was getting contact with Tony Stark is told his secretary that he is unavailable. Agent Sum replies that he gave emergency codes, and she replies that he is unavailable. Agent Sum is furious and enforces the point that they were attacked by an alien life form. Then, a voice comes in saying, “I can help.” It’s Wonder Man and Anya is pleased to see him. He asks where Carol is, and Anya replies that they don’t know. Agent Sum asks Wonder Man whether he is the only one who can reply. Wonder Man then informs them that the emergency codes were recently changed, and if he used an old one, S.H.I.E.L.D. “gets kinda edgy.” Wonder Man then changes the subject, reminding them about Carol. But Agent Sum is suspicious.</p><p>Back on Monster Island, Carol is powerless, but uses her acrobatic training to avoid the monsters. She’s fighting them and rolls down a hill. The monster chases her and Carol uses her feet to throw the monster in a tree branch, stabbing it. Just then, another one comes in. The Cru then comes back and fights along with Carol. It explains that they must work together, link together or else they won’t survive. Their fingers touch each others, and then they are taken to the Cru’s homeland, before it was taken over by the Brood. Cru then goes on to explain how the link between them is two-way, and by that, it will repair their injuries. Cru continues to explain how pieces of her repair and rebuild protocols were left in Carol after their first encounter. She then says that it is end of her world, and soon, Earth. The Cru explains that she attempted to link with her, but Carol fought back, and now she has the time to build an army. The Cru says, that with their bodies unprotected, she hopes that they can do what they have to do before the Brood realise that they are here.</p>",

And…at long last…Ray Palmer!</p><p>Plus, more DC villains origin backup stories, including <b>The Origin of Granny Goodness</b> by Scott Beatty and Jon Bogdanove!</p><p>The COUNTDOWN TO FINAL CRISIS continues! </p><p><i>Spoilers</i></p><p>Last issue Trickster and Piper were being chased by Deadshot while riding a freight train. As they managed to throw him off, he fired upon one of them and apparently killing him. The other tried reviving him by using the \"zap-cuff.\" As he keeps pulling and pulling, finally there is a beep. He hears an electronic voice state that \"Subject B has been terminated.\" A fail safe has been activated and the cuffs are set to detonate in 24 hours. As he thinks about this, Desaad removes a piece from Darkseid playing board. As Desaad brags to Granny Goodness about his new level of authority given by Darkseid, she transforms and heads to Earth to mold her new Female Furies...</p><p>Meanwhile on Paradise Island, the new recruits are continuing their training. They are being put through an extremely rigorous and potentially deadly obstacle course. As they run the course, Harley persuades Holly to take a little leave and explore a nearby cave. Unfortunately it is not unoccupied. </p><p>On Earth-12, the \"Challengers\" still in search of Ray Palmer watch a <i>futuristic sci-fi</i> version of Batman fighting some street thugs. \"Bob\" feels that they are close to ending their search. They are then found by another Monitor. He tells \"Bob\" that the newly named Monitor of Earth-8, Solomon, has united them in saving the integrity of the multiverse. He says that Palmer is insignificant. Jason speaks up to him about how they are the ones trying to save the mulitverse only to be knocked out. He orders \"Bob\" to surrender and stand trial for Crimes against the Multiverse. They are at a standoff as the two Monitors begin fighting each other. Kyle and Donna try to help \"Bob\" even though he says it is not their fight. The other Monitor easily zaps Kyle through his power construct. \"Bob\" uses this distraction to take out the other Monitor. They make their escape as \"Nix Uotan\" vows that they will be found and stopped. They have escaped to The Bleed. \"Bob\" says he now knows where Ray Palmer is after hearing Nix Uotan's words.</p><p>In Bludhaven, Firestorm takes care of the Atomic Knights giving Karate Kid and company a chance to escape into the bunker. They find a locked hatch. Karate Kid sets to open the lock as OMAC detects he is \"in place\" and activates the protocol trigger. Some soldiers report that there is a massive power surge in the storage hangar that houses OMAC. The general is going to order a red alert and picks up the phone. He is then transformed into an OMAC, along with many others. It is said that the \"Morticoccus host is in final gestation\" and viral release is about to happen. An army of OMACs set out for Bludhaven.</p>",

But when the deathless army of Hades invades the mortal world, mere human life may not be enough to stop it. To survive the Battle of the Gods, Athena's Knights will need the power of Heaven itself...</i></p><p><i>That power is embodied in Shaka, the Gold Knight who draws his strength from Buddhism. Beneath a pair of sala trees, where the Buddha died, Shaka makes his last stand against the Specters of Hades. He's prepared to sacrifice everything and face the Gold Knights' most terrifying forbidden technique. What he learns will change the course of battle...and Knighthood...forever!</i></p>",
