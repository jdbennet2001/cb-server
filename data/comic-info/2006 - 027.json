Pick up the book that has everyone talking!</p><p>Driven by what he believes to be “visions from God” delivered by the mutant-hunting Nimrod, Rev. Stryker launches a full-scale assault on the Xavier Institute. Armed with anti-mutant weapons and future tech gleaned from Nimrod, the Purifiers and Stryker take the mansion by storm, nearly killing Cannonball and easily overcoming the few X-Men at the school as they try to take down Frost’s students. Unbeknownst to Stryker, X-23 has thrown a wrench in his carefully laid plans by replacing her teammate Dust and corrupting the prophetic vision that is the basis of his plans. She proves key to the survival of her teammate, Dust who turns the tide of battle inside the Institute. The Purifiers manage to kill Quill but are stopped from further carnage by Dust, X-23 and the rest of the New X-Men team. Stryker’s team is defeated and his role in the recent deaths on campus is revealed. Enraged, Elixir uses his powers to kill Stryker. This turns Josh’s skin from gold to ebony and leaves him catatonic from the shock to his system. In the wake of this destruction, the Nimrod unit that had been “guiding” Stryker is fully re-activated and goes to seek its maker, the mutant called Forge.</p>",

Dibny tells Spectre that he is willing to pay any price in order to bring back his wife, and Spectre sets him on an impossible task. Dibny is taken into deep space, where the mad god Eclipso was placed into solar orbit by the Shadowpact it order to nullify her evil sorcery.</p><p>A twist of fate, however, has made it so that Eclipso inhabits the body of Jean Loring - the woman who murdered Dibny's wife, Sue. Spectre wishes to punish Jean, but cannot do it without a host body - and so asks Dibny to donate his own and avenge Sue. Dibny accepts, and takes Spectre's power. Dibny confronts Eclipso, and the two disappear.</p><p>Week 27, Day 2.</p><p>Waverider is confronted by Skeets. Waverider accuses Skeets of splintering the historical mainline, but Skeets reveals that it was the Luthor from the parallel Earth that started it. Skeets demands that Waverider tell him 'when' Rip Hunter is, and it turns out that Skeets has been taking out time travellers like Time Commander and Clock Queen if they refuse to help it. Waverider refuses to help, and Skeets neutralizes him.</p><p>Nanda Parbat.</p><p>Question has given the Crime Bible to Aristotle Rodor to study. Renee is worried about Question and his constant coughing. Renee reveals that none of the therapies Richard Dragon and Aristotle try on Richard - teas, acupuncture, massage, pills - are helping Question, and she fears that he is getting even sicker. Renee asks Question when he quit smoking, and receives the reply \"not soon enough.\" It turns out that Question has lung cancer and has known for seven months. Question reveals that he hasn't got long to live, and leaves Renee absolutely shocked and upset.</p><p>Later, Aristotle brings up a certain passage of the Crime Bible which references the \"devouring\" of \"the heart of the twice-named daughter of Cain.\" Renee makes a quick connection between that and Kate Kane, especially after seeing an illustration of a devil plucking out the heart of a woman who looks suspiciously like Renee's ex-flame and the new Batwoman.</p><p>Week -84, Day -2.</p><p>Dibny and Eclipso teleport back in time and into Dibny's house. Dibny struggles with the mad goddess, and manages to transform her back into her true form - Jean Loring. Dibny has brought Loring here to watch, over and over again for eternity, how she murdered Sue Dibny. Loring pleads to be let go, but Dibny wrestles her upstairs, where an oblivious Sue decorates a birthday cake. He holds Loring so that she must watch every gruesome moment of it. Dibny is so overwhelmed by the horror of it all himself that he teleports them both back, and fails his mission.</p><p>He asks the helmet of Dr. Fate to get him away from here, and Dibny decides that there must be better ways to bring his wife back than dealing with the Spectre. Dibny and the helmet leave for Nanda Parbat.</p><p>Plus: The Origin Of Black Canary with Howard Chaykin.</p>",
