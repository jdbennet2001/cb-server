Can the team get it together in time to survive the return of the undead Dr. Light? Or will his now-shadowy evil strangle everybody where they stand?</i> <br /> <br />Flashbacks are shown from the life of Paco Ramone aka <a data-ref-id=\"4005-11278\" href=\"/vibe/4005-11278/\"> Vibe</a>. His battles with Amazo and Professor Ivo's androids are documented. His memory download is complete and he is reborn as a Black Lantern. <br /> <br />Meanwhile in the Hall of Justice a crew of JLA members are exploring the wreckage and destruction. The female <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7655\" href=\"/doctor-light/4005-7655/\"> Dr. Light</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2551\" href=\"/vixen/4005-2551/\"> Vixen</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1688\" href=\"/red-tornado/4005-1688/\"> Red Tornado</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\" href=\"/zatanna/4005-5691/\"> Zatanna</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6270\" href=\"/plastic-man/4005-6270/\"> Plastic Man</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10206\" href=\"/gypsy/4005-10206/\"> Gypsy</a> explore its ruins. They explore it and remark about the villains coming back to life.  <br /> <br />As they discuss the pros and cons of storing villains bodies they also discuss the fact that heroes have also returned to life in dark, twisted forms. As they proceed deeper in the Hall of Justice they're confronted by a familiar face and voice. <br /> <br /><a data-ref-id=\"4005-19190\" href=\"/zatara/4005-19190/\"> Zatara</a>, Zatanna's father has been reborn as a Black Lantern. Zatanna says that it is definitely not her father and they engage in a series of spells. As they do battle Vixen says she senses more of them in the building. Zatanna tells her to deal with them and she will handle her father. The two magicians are then teleported away.  <br /> <br />They continue to do battle with spell and hexes. He attempts to rip out her heart but she repels him with a spell and then transports them away again. <br /> <br />Back at the Hall of Justice the female Dr. Light senses something and flies away. The remainder of the team walks through the darkness and decide to keep moving. Gypsy comments to the team that it wasn't sheer luck that Zatara appeared to confront his daughter Zatanna. Vixen comments that Aquaman and Martian Manhunter aren't the only dead Leaguers. Gypsy asks if she means Triumph and Aztek but Vixen says she's thinking of two guys they spent more time with directly during their JLA Detroit days. At that moment another friend from their past then confronts them. Black Lantern Vibe says he missed them and wonders if they missed him. <br /> <br />Gypsy says its impossible he's here because he died. Vibe says its not a big deal these days and the team engages him. He insults the team to get an emotional reaction from them. Red Tornado orders him to stand back saying he will cut him to ribbons. Vibe tells him to go ahead and try. Red Tornado succeeds in destroying his undead body but he is quickly restored. Vibe says that Tornado doesn't have anything he wants. Vibe destroys his android body with his vibrational blasts and turns his attention to Plastic Man. He rips Plastic Man's heart from his chest and ponders what to do with it. <br /> <br />Vixen attacks Vibe and he says he noticed she's favoring her leg. He then insults her and says that she may just need to lose weight. He says Vixen let him die and its time for the JLA Detroit to be reunited. He says her and Gypsy are going to die. Hank Heywood appears as a Black Lantern to assist Vibe. <br /> <br />In another part of the Hall of Justice the female Dr. Light says she senses someone's presence. she says she knew they'd face each other. She flies through a series of corridors and discovers the original Dr. Light licking the corpse of Firestorm's girlfriend Jen. She had been turned to salt by the Black Lantern Firestorm during the main Blackest Night series. he attacks the female Dr. Light with a massive burst of dark energy. He then wonders what she tastes like... <br /> <br />To be continued....",
