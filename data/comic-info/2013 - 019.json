Sally engages in a career as a playwright by penning the school Christmas play but mixes up Gabriel and Geronimo... A hockey mishap sends Snoopy to the doctor for knee surgery, in a (clearly autobiographical) sequence that lasts only until everyone figures out that dogs don’t have knees...

A man-bat jumps on him and attempts to cut his suit but Batman knocks him off and they both fall to the ground. Batman takes a bit of the Man-bats blood and sends a specimen back to the Batcave to Alfred. Batman fights the man-bats and it is revealed that when he was flying to the 900 block he contacted Batgirl and Nightwing but they did not respond even though they can hear him this is because of the effect of Death of the Family when they both lost trust in Bruce. Batman heads off to the apartment where the Man-bat disease first appeared while fighting off loads of Man-bats and the Man-bat disease is slowly spreading outside of the 900 block and into the larger area of Gotham. Batman finds the apartment and goes into it finding Zsaz’s knife in the back of a man he killed. Batman studies the serum he finds which is revealed to be like the Man-bat serum that Talia Al Ghul uses in Batman Incorporated. Zsaz now a Man-bat jumps Batman from behind and Batman ties him up and jumps him out of the window and they both crash into a car outside of the apartment. Batwoman appears with Kirk and Francine Langstrom and Kirk reveals that he created the Man-bat serum and it is revealed that he didn’t unleash it on Gotham someone stole it from his lab and Ogivily then released it into the air causing the original infection in the 900 block. Kirk injects himself with the antidote to the virus and becomes Man-bat but cures everyone else of the virus he then flies off into the sky and leaves. In the aftermath a lot of people are taken to hospital and Zsaz says that this was all Ogivily the Emperor penguin to Batman and this is the first part of his war against Batman, Ogivily then appears with Poison Ivy and asks her to return the favour for saving her life.</p><p><b><u>Man-bat birth of a family </u></b></p><p>Man-bat is out in Gotham on top a church and sees Batman take down a group of criminals after jumping out of the Bat jet. Francine Langstrom remembers her husband and what they set out to do which is to create the serum to help Deaf kids hear things and also she remembers their marriage. Kirk is seen at a press conference telling an audience what he was setting out to do with his serum but a man asks about side effects and Kirk says that there a few but does not mention what they are, which is that the deaf kids have turned into Man-bats and how Kirk worked hard to stop this and how his formula was stolen. Francine misses her husband and takes the Man-bat serum to be with him.</p><p><b><u>Bane in War council </u></b></p><p>Bane walks through Santa Prisca being saluted by his army.

Bane fights them breaking one of their heads breaking their heads and one of the talons back and pulling off the 3<sup>rd </sup>talon’s head. The Court of Owls wants Bane out of and they tell him that a night of Owls will descend on Gotham and they want him out. Flash-forward to when Bane was fighting Batman and he was knocked off the cliff.

One of his gang takes off his mask because his nose itched and then Mr Combustible orders his other men to kill him and he becomes a Man-bat and is then shot. Mr Combustible gets his men out explaining that the virus is spreading over Gotham turning more people in Man-bats. Emperor Penguin is revealed to be behind it and that the reason for the 900 was simply to get money to fuel his crime empire and he made robberies across Gotham with other villains doing it robbing money, computers and paintings. Mr Combustible talks with Penguin and Penguin reveals that he is going to get out after he gets Mr Combustible to threaten his judge to let him off.</p><p><b><u>Through a Blue lens</u></b></p><p>Batman is seen fighting with a Man-bat and we see a Policeman sitting in hospital with his friends and the Policeman is revealed to have been a Man-bat but has been cured now. His friends joke about how he should have hurt Batman more because he doesn’t respect anything they do and he’s a maniac. A police woman responds saying that he doesn’t mean that about Batman but he then explains why he doesn’t like Batman and he and his friends have a joke and a drink about it and tells the Police woman who thinks Batman is good that no one will partner up with her because of this. The ex-Man-bat Policeman talks to the policewoman and says he likes Batman as well because he saved him from killing a woman the two then share a drink and he says he will gladly partner up with her.</p><p>This oversized anniversary issue also includes 8 pin ups by Alex Maleev, Brett Booth, Chris Burnham, Jason Fabok, Andy Clarke, Fransesco Francavilla, Cameron Stewart and Dustin Nguyen.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>During the horror comics boom of the early 1950′s, the demand for the macbre was high, and an incredible volume of pages featuring spooky material were churned out- in more ways than one. Aesthetic standards varied greatly. On the high end, that era spawned the EC Comics horror line; considered by many to be among the highest-quality comic books ever produced. At the other end of the spectrum were the poverty-row publishers, employing artists with far less skill and experience. Not always the worst matchup, though- grotesquely hideous artwork on a horror story is far more effective than on a romance comic! All of that aside, many of the artistic giants throughout comic book history have done exemplary work in the horror genre, even if we are more accustomed to associating their names with other types of comic books, and Crypt of Horror Volume 19 highlights a selection of great artists that fit that description. Jack Kirby was the unquestioned “king” of illustrating rollicking action on the comic book page, but did you know he could also craft a moody and mysterious missive as well? Then check out this issue’s “Saucer Man”, inked by Al Williamson. Awed my Steve Ditko’s work on the classic Spider-Man ? You ain’t seen nothin’ till you’ve sampled some of the weird chillers he drew for Charlton and other companies a decade before, like “What Happened?”, right here in this volume. Alex Toth- storyteller supreme and master of the tasteful use of chiarascuro? Prepare to be scared out of your WITS by his “Murder Mansion”! Bob Powell, Joe Sinnott, and a host of others are here; great artists all, perhaps better known for their efforts delineating superheroes, adventure, humor or glamor- but never better than when weltering in grisly horror!! Like Dick Ayers on “I Crawl Through Graves”, Bill Everett on “Don’t Bury Me Deep”, George Altman illustrating “You’re Going To Die Yesterday”, Bernard Bailey’s “Lost, One World!”, Sol Brodsky on “The Man Who Moved”; Bernie Krigstein’s “The Man Who Couldn’t Be Reached”, Sid Greene’s “Too Late”, Joe Maneely illustrating “The Iron Door”, Werner Roth on “The Rival”, plus Manny Stallman, Fred Kida, Fran Smith, John Forte, Dave Berg, Myron Fass, BobFujitani, Gene Colan, and half-a-dozen others!! 29 full vintage horror stories reprinted in all!! 140 pages in black and white with color covers, standard comic book size, saddle-stitched. Check out Crypt of Horror Volume 19, and see the greatest artists in comic book history in an all-new (and scary) light!!</em></p>",

How can he be a warrior when he can't stand even to hunt small animals? Unhappy and alone in his views, Siddhartha begins to question his destiny.
