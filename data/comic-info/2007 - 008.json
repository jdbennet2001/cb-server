The gangsters and hoods with old axes to grind -- them you expected, but not this guy: Someone who knows you, someone who wants your undivided attention and is willing to do anything to get it. And certainly not the fugitive Captain America, who shows up at your doorstep, wanting a word. Maybe he thinks he can harness all your excess energy into something useful...something that can aid him in his grudge match with Tony Stark in the CIVIL WAR tearing through the Marvel U? Maybe this war is worth winning at any cost? And you get to thinking...</p><p><i>Story occurs before the events of Civil War #6-7</i></p><p>Moon Knight is paid a visit by Steve Rogers, Captain America. Marc is very short with him. He tells him that he is not interested in his war against Tony Stark. Marc tells him that he and Stark should just get a room and leave everyone else out of it. Cap says he's not there to recruit him. He doesn't approve of his methods. He says he's crazier than Frank Castle. Basically Cap tells him to keep out of the way. During this entire conversation, the spirit of Khonshu has been telling him to simply kill him.</p><p>Going to a crime scene, Moon Knight runs into Detective Mogart. It appears that the recent killings have a connection to Moon Knight's former enemy, the Midnight Man, except he's dead. Someone is going out of their way killing and mutulating a lot of people to get Moon Knight's attention.</p><p>Later Moon Knight drives by to \"check\" on Marlene. He wants to make sure she's safe. He sees her meet up with another man.</p><p>In another part of town, the killer is preparing another message for Moon Knight. There is a woman with him and part of his face is revealed to be a scarred mess.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Beginning the long awaited, epic crossover between the new Justice League and the new Justice Society, uniting the combined writing talents of best-selling author Brad Meltzer and comics mega-star Geoff Johns for the ultimate team-up! \"The Lightning Saga\" 5-parter begins with the mystery of who Trident is, and how his identity crisis will change everything!</p><p>The Justice League and the Justice Society are working together on a training day. In The Hall in Washington D.C., Mr. Terrific is playing chess blindfolded with both Hal Jordan and Black Canary at the same time. In the Kitchen, 22,300 miles above the Earth, Red Arrow, Wildcat, Geo-Force, Vixen, Hawkgirl, Red Tornado are playing \"capture the flag.\" In the Batcave, Batman and Black Lightning are trying to figure out who Trident is after capturing him.</p><p>Batman says the Fortress computers have identified him as Karate Kid and he is wearing a Legion of Superheroes ring. Black Lightning asks why didn't he go by \"Karate Kid\" when they fought him. Batman says perhaps it's due to the Starro he had on his neck. Superman had listed him as a Class-15 fighter in his computer. Batman notices that he's listed at 12. As Karate Kid awakes and knocks out Black Lightning, Batman says to himself how he loves to prove Clark wrong. Batman allowed Karate Kid to get close to draw him in. The fist fight begins.</p><p>Wildcat, Red Arrow, and Geo-Force are stuck starring at their opponents' flag across a fifty foot field with no cover. Red Arrow decides to run out knowing that Hawkgirl is hoping to flush them out. As she dives down on him, he grabs the flag and shoots it at her with his arrow. She tries flapping her wings hoping the wind will knock it off course. At the last moment, Red Tornado arrives, unleashing his powers. He seems to have miscalculated as he sends Red Arrow flying towards a tree at over sixty miles per hour. Suddenly he stops in mid-air. Apparently Geo-Force was able to affect his gravity much to everyone's surprise.</p><p>As Batman and Karate Kid fight, Batman tries to convince him that his name is Val Armorr. He insists it's Trident. Karate Kid manages to grab Batman's utility belt and notices that he's shifted his weight to his left leg. He notes that with the pain he feels in that leg, he must have given him a hernia. Batman snarls that that is not why he shifted to his left as Black Lightning strikes Karate Kid from behind. Batman calls Clark to meet them at the Hall.</p><p>At the Hall, both Mr. Terrific and Black Canary call out checkmate. As Batman comes in carrying Karate Kid, he notices the game. He tells them that Mr. Terrific wasn't playing both of them at once. He was playing them against each other.</p><p>As both the League and the Society look over Karate Kid, Mr. Terrific is surprised when it's mentioned that he is supposedly from the future. He tells them that their newest JSA member, Starman, also says he's from the future. Upon hearing Starman's name, Karate Kid says Starman's name is Thom Kallor and his is Val Armorr. He is shocked that he knows that. Mr. Terrific calls Power Girl to pick up Starman from the \"looney bin.\"</p><p>Flashback to 1948 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. A couple men visit a patient and switch back and forth when referring to the gender of Dolores Winters. They call her the Ultra Humanite. Dolores has cancer. The men tell her that she is going to die tomorrow by a massive brain hemorrhage unless she takes a trip with them.</p><p>Diana uses her magic lasso on Karate Kid but he still cannot recall all the facts. He tells them that when he heard the name \"Starman\" the Trident part of him seemed to disappear. Batman concludes that he must have telepathic fail-safes in place. As Power Girl arrives with Starman, Starman says something in an alien language and Karate Kid falls over. He barely whispers, \"We're not the only ones.\" Regaining his balance he tells them that there were seven of them scattered and all stuck in this time.</p><p>Later, Mr. Terrific is fascinated that Red Tornado can see him since he's invisible to all machines. Getting back on track, they managed to trace the signal back from Karate Kid's Legion ring. They mention that Booster, Vril Dox, Kara, and Clark all had rings (Clark actually had two). Now they need to find the other members of these seven soldiers. They prepare by spliting into teams.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p> <p>Part 3 of Jodi Picoult's WONDER WOMAN run welcomes the return of art team Terry Dodson and Rachel Dodson! Diana Prince was charged with capturing Wonder Woman for the Department of Metahuman Affairs, and she's unwittingly succeeded. But the true reason for her illegal detainment can and will precipitate a bloody war, one that even Diana is powerless to prevent! This issue leads directly into AMAZONS ATTACK #1.</p> <p>On Themyscira, there is magic in the air. Circe uses her powers and has revived Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons. As Circe welcomes her back, she says \"You wish is my desire. Or vice versa...\" There is still some magic crackling in the air and there appears to be some in the Queen's eyes. She asks where her daughter is.</p> <p>Wonder Woman is still being held by the government. Circe shows Hippolyta that she is caged and defeated by man. She asks Circe why she would revive her. Circe says that the enemy of her enemy is her friend. Hippolyta notes that the world of man hasn't changed. What they don't understand, they fear. What they fear, they try to control. She says that, to them, her daughter is the enemy. Circe says that enemies must be crushed. Hippolyta is prepared to give them a war if that is what they want.</p> <p>At the Villains &amp; Vixens Bar, Nemesis is drinking alone. He's been trying to contact his partner, Diana, not knowing that she is Wonder Woman. Heading to the Department of Metahuman Affairs, he runs into Sarge Steel in the parking lot. Steel tells him that the reason he hasn't been able to contact Agent Prince is because she's been reassigned and the Wonder Woman case is closed. Nemesis tries telling Steel that Wonder Woman is being set up. There's nothing Steel can do. The Department has taken custody of Wonder Woman and he doesn't know where they've taken her. He continues to question why is she being treated this way and how is Circe involved. Steel responds by telling him that he's been reassigned too. Nemesis is to go to Portland, Maine. He's not happy with the situation and plans to do something about it.</p> <p>In Wonder Woman's cell, Circe appears. She tells her that she's not really there. Circe tries telling her that they are the same. They're both powerful and are fighting for what they believe in. Wonder Woman says you can't just take right or wrong out of the equation. Circe reminds her that times change. In the past it was acceptable to own slaves or to beat your wife. Perhaps what is wrong today will be right tomorrow. Circe says that love and murder are all that matter. She says they're what it means to be human. Diana says murder doesn't make you human. As Circe disappears, she says to tell that to Max Lord, or herself.</p> <p>In the control room monitoring Wonder Woman's cell, Sarge Steel comes busting in. He is ticked off and asks the agent why no one is following the orders he made. The agent responds that they've made it so no one is allowed to that sector and six guards are on patrol by what they have been told is a closet. Steel then pushes the agent's face into one of the computer monitors. He drags the agent into a room where at least three others are seen bound and gagged. He sneaks into the elevator and goes down to where Wonder Woman's cell is. When the two guards there question him after he said no one was to enter, he slams their heads together. He blows open Wonder Woman's cell and reveals that he is really Nemesis posing as Steel.<br /></p> <p>Wonder Woman says she has no reason to trust him. Nemesis reveals that he took her magic lasso from the evidence locker and wraps it around himself. He tells her to ask him the truth. Wonder Woman grabs the end of the lasso and looks at him. She releases him and says she can trust him. Guards are outside the door. Wonder Woman asks if he posed as Steel the whole way in. When the guards enter, she hits him so it doesn't appear that he's helped her. She takes out the guards and punches through a wall. She continues to punch throught the ground to make her escape, with Nemesis behind her.<br /></p> <p>In Washington D.C., Hippolyta and the Amazons attack. The Army is no match for them. Sarge Steel (the real one) contacts Batman asking for his help. Batman says it doens't make any sense that they'd attack and doesn't understand why Wonder Woman isn't anywhere around. Batman says that Black Lightning is on the scene and the rest of the JLA is on the way. As the screen shuts off, Circe comments on Batman's fashion sense. Steel tells her to get out so no one sees her. She tells him that he's the only one that can. He tells her that he's \"delivering the capes\" and what is she doing? She tells him to relax since she got him Wonder Woman.</p> <p>Underground in the sewers, Wonder Woman and Nemesis continue walking. He's upset that she hit him and knocked out a tooth. She says she was just trying to make it look like he wasn't involved. Nemesis explains that he changes into other people so they'd already know it was him. Wonder Woman then asks if he has anything she could fix her costume with. He has some epoxy in his belt and she tells him to look away. He is surprised that she'd be insecure about herself. Wonder Woman says it's not about insecurity but rather decency. Nemesis says what is decent is the birthmark she has on the same place that she's a pain in. Wonder Woman calls him a pig but there is an explosion behind them. She lands on top of him and they both stop for a moment looking at each other. Wondering where the explosion came from and who it was for, Wonder Woman carries them to the surface. They see Washington being attacked. In the wreckage, Wonder Woman is shocked to see her mother.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The spotlight turns to Liberty Belle as the All-American powerhouse races to stop the Justice Society's troubled young recruit, Damage, from making the worst mistake of his life.</p><p>Things seems to be going swell in the life of the Justice Society. Liberty Belle and Hourman are enjoying a weekend snowboarding in Aspen. Jesse recalls that her life wasn't always a bed of roses. Thinking back to her childhood, she recalls when her father, Johnny Quick, works with her in the basement, trying to get her to use the Mathematical formula that will allow her to move at superspeed. Her father tells her it's not just about the formula but getting to a place in her mind where she can access her power just as he and her mother do. Jesse's mother tells Johnny not to fill her head with ideas of super powers. She is getting tired of all his talk of powers. All of their friends can't stand it either and won't have dinner with them anymore. He says he just wants Jesse to become special. This comment just hurts her feelings. Less than a year later, Jesse's parents got divorced.</p><p>She continued to live with her father until college and eventually became Jesse Quick, once she achieved super speed. She fought crime with her father and the Justice Society. Her father was wrong about their speed. They did get their speed from the Speed Force. He was killed and she gave her speed to the Flash when he had to fight Zoom.</p><p>Speaking of Zoom, he is on a rampage at this moment. The Justice Society is following him, trying to put a stop to his activities. They soon reach the state line of Georgia. Alan Scott tells Damage that he has to sit out the rest of the chase. Damage tells Alan that he knows what Zoom did to him and Alan says there's the matter of what he did to Atlanta. Damage powers up and blasts down, allowing himself to do a giant leap away from them. Alan informs an impressed Cyclone why it's a bad idea for Damage to go into Georgia. He promised never to step foot in Georgia for the damage he caused and they agreed not to charge him for the destruction.</p><p>Jesse and Rick are soon called by Power Girl. She fills them in on their chase after Zoom. It seems that there is now a hostage situation. Damage has Zoom in his grasp. Since the two of them have been looking after Damage, Jesse says that she will be the one to try to talk to him and calm him down.</p><p>Inside the courtroom, Damage has a firm hold on Zoom. He tells him that he's charged himself up so that the slightest movement by Zoom will set him off. Zoom starts going on about how he told him he'd be a stronger hero if he survived. Jesse tries to get Grant to think about all the innocents that will die if he doesn't listen to her.</p><p>All Damage can think of his how Zoom ruined his face. He tells her that he had to break every mirror in his place because he couldn't stand to look at himself. She reminds him that she saw his face when Captain Nazi ripped off his mask. She also says that her life wasn't perfect when she lost her speed. Zoom butts in and says that she didn't lose it, she just gave it up because she didn't feel she was worthy of it. Damage starts getting angry that Zoom is talking this way to her but she tells him that, in a way, Zoom is right. She didn't feel she deserved the speed after her father died.</p><p>Jesse finally manages to get through to Grant and he powers down. Zoom, seeing his moment, runs out of Damage's grasp and decides he should put him out of his misery. He picks up a metal pipe and throws it at Grant's face at super speed. Reciting the formula, Jesse moves at super speed and catches the pipe before it can hit Grant. In return, she throws it at a stunned Zoom and it clocks him in the head.</p><p>Jesse and Grant walk out to find the authorities ready to arrest Grant. Jesse tells them that if they're going to arrest him, they'll have to arrest her too. Hourman corrects her by saying they'll have to arrest the entire Justice Society.</p><p>Ready to leave, they all head to Aspen for fun in the snow.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The second cover is a homage of the cover of <em><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/action-comics-1-superman-champion-of-the-oppressed/4000-105403/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-105403\">Action Comics #1</a></em>.</li></ul>",

Alonzo is informed that Atlas is dead, and that he, as Apollo, stands next in line for Atlas's burden and is the new godly benefactor to the powers of Shazam. Apollo reluctantly agrees to the terms on the condition that Freddy defeats him in battle, otherwise he'd resume his mortal life and Freddy would die.

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>A virtually unstoppable force has driven the Doom Patrol to the brink of destruction and despair! And why is The Flash the only hero who can possibly stand between them and utter chaos?</p><p>At Challenger Mountain, the Challengers of the Unknown continue reading the Book of Fate in shifts. It seems they get sucked into reading it and lose track of time. They also become so entwined in it that they become bitter and snap at each other. As Red Ryan reads the book, he barks at Rocky that they have all the history and future to read and have to figure out what \"Megistus\" means as it keeps popping up. Rocky tells him to take a break so that he doesn't lose his mind and takes over. As June comes in and asks Rocky what just happened between them, Rocky snaps at June.</p><p>In Keystone City, Linda hands Wally the mail. He immediately tears up, at super speed, a letter from Dr. Niles Caulder. Linda mentions that he's been sending letters, e-mails, and leaving messages. He insists that he can help their kids with their unstable powers yet Wally keeps ignoring him. As they discuss this, Iris is listening from under the bed, her head phasing through the floor as Jai holds her up in the kitchen below. Walls is adamant that Caulder will not go anywhere near the kids. Iris pleads with Wally. As the leader of Doom Patrol, he's supposed to be one of the \"good guys.\" Wally just doesn't like the guy. He gets the impression that he enjoys experimenting on people too much. A crash below scares the two of them into thinking something has happened to the kids. Iris lies that Jai was just being clumsy. Iris tells Wally that she's tired of always being on edge, waiting for another change in their kids' powers. Wally agrees to take them to see Caulder.</p><p>At the Doom Patrol castle, Caulder answers the door with very little warmth. The kids are a little scared. Elasti-Girl is with them and introduces herself to the kids with a big smile. As Caulder wishes to speak to Wally and Linda, Rita agrees to take the kids on a tour, including showing them the torture chamber. This excites the kids. Caulder tells Wally and Linda that what he wants to say to them concerns their future.</p><p>As the kids are getting their tour, they begin pulling their way to look at different things. Looking back, they notice that Rita is practically in the last room despite the fact that they are still holding her hands. Seeing the big smile on her face along with her arms stretched completely freaks them out and they run away. In a dark hallway, they hear some metallic footsteps. All they can see is the glow of red eyes as Robotman says, \"Mmmm. Flesh.\" He was kidding but the kids run off anyways. Then they run into Larry Trainer, the fact that he looks like a mummy doesn't help the kids. Iris grabs Jai's hand and phases them into the floor. Larry sends Negative Man after them.</p><p>In Caulder's lab, he tells the Wests that he has built a machine for each of them to help stabilize their metabolisms. When Wally shows his doubts, Caulder says it's a pity that he doesn't trust him. As these words are spoken, a green gas begins to form in between the chambers of the machine. Instinctively, Wally yells to Linda to stand back from the trap. He spins his arms at super speed to dissipate the gas. It begins to talk to him and reveals itself to be Metamorpho. He's there visiting. As he begins to explain that he's there to help the Chief with his experiment, the screams for help from the kids can be heard.</p><p>Iris punches Negative Man, telling him to stay away from her as Jai holds Robotman pinned to the floor. Robotman says that it shouldn't be possible for her to actually punch Negative Man. Wally soon arrives and grabs them. He notices Iris hitting Negative Man. He mentions that she must have found the right vibrational frequency. Then a huge arm is placed in between them to stop the fighting.</p><p>The discussion continues over dinner about helping the kids. They are still a little weirded out by the Doom Patrol. When Rita reminds Larry to use manners when slirping through a straw, he reminds her that if he unwraps his bandages, he'll irradiate everyone. When Robotman is asked why he isn't eating, he mentions that me just absorbs a health shake the Chief made and removes his head plate to show his brain to them. This pushes them over the edge and they jump in their parents' arms. The two of them are outraged that they continue to scare their kids. They just want to get the test over with and leave.</p><p>Back in the lab, the kids are in their chambers. Metamorpho stands in between connected to the machinery, stabilizing it. The Chief explains that the machines will pull the kids apart and reassemble their biostructure almost instantaneously. Metamorpho is keeping them safe. The machine readings begin to redline, Metamorpho lets out a scream of agony, and Wally runs to the kids. He is bounced back and Metamorpho can be seen fading away. The kids are in a state of...decomposition. Wally demands to know what is going on. Rita mentions that something took Metamorpho away. Wally is going to grab the kids when the Chief tells them that if he doesn't stay back, his contact will kill them. They have not been reassembled yet and one touch will scatter their atoms. The only thing that can keep them together is the metal alloy from Robotman. The problem is, it can only hold one of the kids. Wally has to decide which one to save.</p><p>In that moment, Wally doesn't know what to say. Then he tells the Chief that there isn't a choice. Both kids must be saved. He tells them to bring out Negative Man. The Chief agrees that it could work. Robotman's armor is placed around Jai and Iris is wrapped with Negative Man. Wally tells Negative Man to remember what it felt like when he punched her and to try to tune into her frequency.</p><p>After throwing some switches and a bright flash of light, it seems to have worked. Jai appears as a little Robotman and Iris is tingling from being wrapped by Negative Man. Jai asks if they are going to have to stay like that but Wally doesn't know how to answer them. Linda yells at the Chief to answer them. He says that they are beginning to stabilize so it shouldn't be too much longer. This is good because the tickling feeling Iris is feeling is starting to bother her and Larry is starting to feel pain from being separated from Negative Man.</p><p>With the kids back to \"normal,\" the Wests are prepared to leave. Caulder tells them they deserve an apology but it's too bad that Metamorpho isn't there to give it. Wally can't believe that Caulder is trying to put all the blame on Rex. He says it's not like them to bail in a moment of crisis. Caulder says he could find out more if he did more tests. Wally and Linda both quickly say no. Before they teleport out, Rita notices a word burned into a piece of metal with acid by Rex. It says, \"Megistus.\" No one knows what it means. Caulder continues to try to tell them that the kids would benefit from being with them. He activates the teleporter before he can finish his sentence.</p><p>Back home, Wally and Linda are in their bedroom. The Justice Leauge has been alerted to search for Metamorpho. He then tells Linda that in that split second he had to choose between the kids, he did. In tears, he explains that in the one tiny moment, she didn't have the chance to really understand the question. That little moment was plenty of time for Wally to think and think about it. He is ashamed that he was able to make a choice before thinking about using Negative Man. Linda asks who he chose but he asks if it really matters.</p><p>At Challenger Mountain, Rocky is reading all about this, sweat pouring from his head. June comes in and says he's been reading for hours. She tells him he needs to step away since it is so draining. He pulls himself away but writes down the word \"Megistus\" on a post-it since it keeps popping up. As they walk away, a hand forms from the pages and reaches out.</p>",

He tells her that he loves her, in his own, special way. Then he punches her in the face and strangles her to death with her own tie. Emerging from the hotel room, he tells Bruno to \"Get rid of it.\"</p><p>During this, Batman explains to Dick Grayson about who The Joker is. Shortly after, Batman takes a very drugged-up triggerman (the one who killed Dick's parents) and dumps him in the trunk of the Batmobile. He takes him to one of Gotham's many piers, but on the way, he finds the Green Lantern symbol high in the sky. He mutters, \"Not HIM...not THAT moron. ...Jesus, what a BOTHER\" then he dumps the murdering \"gun for hire\" in the water.</p><p>Robin is walking around the Batcave and looking at all of the \"cool\" weapons, he picks up a bow and arrow and images Robin Hood in the dead of night taking aim up at the sky, he then asks Alfred for some \"Tights. And a mask. And a cape. With a hood.\"</p><p>Batman goes high into the night to investigate the Green Lantern symbol, he finds the source of the signal, Hal Jordan, the Emerald Crusader, stuffing his face with a hot dog and a soda. When Bats asks what he wants, Hal replies with, \"I just want to talk.\" So Batman gives him a location and a time.</p><p>During this, The Joker gives a proposition to Catwoman. She tells him that she is \"all ears.\"</p><p>When Batman arrives back at the batcave, he finds the costumed Dick Grayson firing an arrow at Batman, he catches it and says \"Nice shot, kid.\"</p><p>He replies, \"Don't call me kid. Don't call me boy. Don't call me brat. Don't call me a little snot. Call me Hood.\" Dick explains that his dad would always make him watch these really old Robin Hood movies and that's what inspired his costume.</p><p>Batman shows him that on the street, any thug with half a brain would pull that hood down over his face. \"Lose the hood. You're Robin\"</p>",
