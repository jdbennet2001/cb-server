And will the cabal of Sable, Meridian, Sol Invictus, and the Manchurian be able to decipher the mysteries of the prison before one of them is selected to enter the arena?</i></p><p><i>Written by industry legend Paul Jenkins (SENTRY, INHUMANS) and drawn by comics superstar Carlos Magno (PLANET OF THE APES, TRANSFORMERS), DEATHMATCH is a dark, psychological deconstruction of the superhero genre that can't be missed.</i></p><h2>Plot Description</h2><p>The issue opens up with both <a data-ref-id=\"4005-87006\" href=\"/sable/4005-87006/\">Sable</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-87004\" href=\"/the-rat/4005-87004/\">The Rat</a> examining one of the bodies of the fallen light guards. Just before Sable can get a better understanding of the body, it instantly disappears as a small group of light guards enter the wing, threatening to kill both of the should they put up a struggle. Just before they are captured, Sable knocks out The Rat after The Rat asks her to do so. After Sable is released from the light guards, her and the heroes try to figure out what it is that makes them fight one another so blindly. Just as they are discussing their situation, another battle of Deathmatch starts up on the monitors, this time it is between <a data-ref-id=\"4005-86920\" href=\"/cube/4005-86920/\">Cube</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-86995\" href=\"/monkey/4005-86995/\">Monkey</a>.</p><h4>The Main Battle:</h4><h3>Monkey VS The Cube</h3><p>Just before the battle begins, Cube insults Monkey and before Monkey could respond he shoots a large assembly of his poisonous tentacles in Monkey's direction, which wrap themselves around his body. Almost instantly, Monkey responds by biting and pulling through the various strands of tentacles to free himself.</p><p>Appearing to be in fear of Monkey, Cube retreats through the Colosseum's thick brush which one of the viewing heroes describes as unsmart because \"Cube can't use his poisonous tentacles in the thick undergrowth. He is going the wrong way.\"</p><p>As Cube continues to run away, Monkey double kicks Cube's back and plants himself on top of Cube. He then ferociously gnaws on Cube's face, but to his surprise Cube smiles and responds with a joke, saying \"And the Oscar goes to Cube.\"</p><p>Cube's face literally opens up and releases a set of tentacles which wrap themselves around Monkey's face. It is revealed that Cube was putting on an act in order to get Monkey closer to him. After a few seconds, Monkey's face melts into itself and Cube is deemed the winner of the match.</p><p>----</p><p>Back at the holding area, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-86851\" href=\"/dragonfly/4005-86851/\">Dragonfly</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-86994\" href=\"/mink/4005-86994/\">Mink</a> discuss the match up as well as Sable's true identity. Dragonfly is curious about it, but Mink refuses to help Dragonfly figure it out stating that he is better off not knowing the truth. Before they could continue a commotion in the main square brings all the captured heroes and villains together. To their surprise, the monitors reveal all the next match ups between the villains and heroes.

They decide to make an alliance, but Mister Chuckles stats that he can't wait to kill her in the arena.</p><p>--</p><p>It is then revealed that Sol Invictus killed Replic-8 in the death match. Now angered by his actions, he threatens to tear the prison apart with his bare hands, but is told by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-86993\" href=\"/meridian/4005-86993/\">Meridian</a> that breaking out is impossible because he tried himself. Meridian then suggests that they should just stop trying to break out and focus on the battles and just play the game. Sable then questions Meridian about him using human lives as collateral damage. Meridian then threatens Sable, but is stopped by Dragonfly. Dragonfly then attacks Meridian verbally about forgetting his role as a leading superhero. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-86919\" href=\"/berserk/4005-86919/\">Berserk</a> then confronts Meridian, but before anyone can stop him, Meridian fires his laser bolts through Berserk's head, killing him instantly.</p>",

Their duty? Protect the innocent from a locust-like race of moth-vampires. Of course, wherever a 7-ft tall ape-man is concerned, things donât go quite as planned.</i></p><p><i>Brewhouse Comics is proud to present the next chapter of BIGFOOT â SWORD OF THE EARTHMAN, the monumental six-issue mini-series involving the world-famous sasquatch and his quest to defeat the ruthless emperor of a barbarian planet. Written by Josh S. Henaman with art by Kubert alums Andy Taylor (line art) and Thomas Bonvillain (colorist), BIGFOOT â SWORD OF THE EARTHMAN is not the story of how Bigfoot became a myth on Earth. Itâs the story of how he became a legend of the stars.<br /><br /></i></p><h2>Quoted Praises For Issue Two</h2><p>The following are quotes that Brewhouse has published inside their comic books</p><p>\"<em>Just finished the second comic in a moving car and now I am carsick but it was totally worth it.</em>\" -Caleb M.</p><p> </p><p>\"<em>The entire premise of the comic is as awesome as the title.</em>\" <i>- </i>Tommy Lutz - ReadComicBooks.net</p><p> </p><p>\"<em>The whole package is something I think most comic fans would have trouble putting down</em>\" - Cory Thrall - Bag &amp; Bored</p><p> </p><p>â<em>Bigfoot: SOTE is a big weird comic book that deifes description...

UNCANNY X-FORCE</i></p><p><i>What secrets does the man with the \"M\" on his face bring from the future?</i></p><h3><i><br /></i>Synopsis</h3><p>In a secluded part of Los Angeles, Lucas Bishop wanders into a restricted area. Police officers try to stop him but he shrugs them off with a very uncharacteristic and primal roar.</p><p>In a club, Psylocke confronts the consequences of her brash actions against Spiral. The entire club seems to be possessed by an entity urging them to fight her collectively. Some members of the throng chant \"stop her\" in unison. Psylocke co-opts a man into helping her via her telepathy and he begins beating people off her. Scanning the minds of her attacks Psylocke views an angelic image that seems to prompt the \"stop her\" chant on the dance floor. She then turns her attention to her helper, changing his mindset to that of being in a video game so as to help him not be so reserved in hitting his friends. He perceives that he is a fighter in Mike Tyson's Punch Out and swings with wanton abandon.</p><p>In a vault, Storm and Puck find a girl who seems to be motivating the club crowd with telepathic signals. Before they can figure out what to do with her Spiral appears and teleports away with the girl. Puck acts fast and latches on and gets teleported to the roof with the two. Puck and Spiral spar for a moment before he gets hurled off the building. Fortunately, Storm catches him on her way up to the roof. When Storm sees that Spiral will not release the girl she sends Puck hurling at Spiral. Naturally, Spiral teleports away and Puck hits a wall.</p><p>Back in the club, Psylocke begins using her psi-blade freely, resetting everyone's minds as she retrieves her sword. The battle is quickly over.</p><p>In Hungary, Phantomex and Cluster enjoy a romantic dinner in a stolen air ship. Phantomex presents Cluster with some very rare stolen goods and she can't help but ask if he misses Psylocke. He hesitates but answers in the negative. Cluster admits that she misses Psylocke and, if she does, then Dark Phantomex must as well. She proposes they find Psylocke and protect her.</p><p>Aboard Psylocke's vehicle, Puck tries to get cute to break down Psylocke's brusk demeanor. She, however, is scanning for the little girl. She is able to get a location based on the angelic image she saw in the club group's minds.</p><p>Accross town, Spiral finds a bracelet for the girl, Ginny. The bracelet is supposed to shield Ginny from being detected. Too late, as Psylocke, Storm, and Puck have already located the two. Before they can take Ginny from Spiral, however, a blast rocks everyone to the ground. Bishop enters and roars at everyone. Storm and Psylocke try to grasp what their old friend is doing back, though Psylocke senses that something is wrong with Bishop's mind. She tries to psi-blade him but he is too quick and forces her to the ground. He proclaims that he is no more Bishop. The image of a fiery bear looms over him.</p>",

The man keeps asking her to remove her hood, and show what she's hiding. Black Widow removes the hood to show one eye badly disfigured, but the man still insists on trying to rob her. The man is however shot by Moon Knight, and he and Black Widow talk to each other through sign language with Black Widow stating that, âI had it,â and Moon Knight saying, âsure you did.â</p><p>As the Ultron's continue to attack human that won't submit Black Widow and Moon Knight enter one of Nick Fury's hidden hideouts, but due to entering at different points Black Widow almost attacks Moon Knight. They find out that the hideout was the one that Fury used during the Skrull Invasion (Secret Invasion). When Moon Knight asks if Ultron knows about this Black Widow says that Fury never wrote anything down, so there'd be no trail for Ultron to follow. Black Widow finishes by asking Moon Knight to help her destroy Ultron, which Moon Knight agrees to.</p><p>Meanwhile Spider-Man is in the underground hideout that is currently occupying 7,000 heroes. He reveals his name stating that secret identities don't mean anything any more  Whilst saying that he woke up one morning to find the world had gone to hell he's asked about what he saw. A flash back shows Peter waking up and going through New York with flames around, and at the end of his recollection he asks if it was just in Manhattan. After finding out that the whole world is most likely under Ultron's control Peter says that he's happy he's with them. Iron Man then asks how he got kidnapped and another small flashback shows how, with Peter mentioning that his Spider-Sense didn't even go off. After saying that Hammerhead and Owl were going to sell him to Ultron Luke Cage asks why Ultron needed them to do that, and not just take him himself. After being told by Iron Man that the plan was to survive, Peter says that that's not something, until Captain America comes in stating that they finally have a plan.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Part 2 of the incredible horror anthology Four Color Fear! This installment includes twisted yarns like Jack Katz's \"Me, Ghost\" and \"Drum of Doom\" by Al Williamson, as well as a stunning cover gallery! Of the myriad genres comic books ventured into during its golden age, none was as controversial as or came at a greater cost than horror; the public outrage it incited almost destroyed the entire industry. Yet before the watchdog groups and Congress could intercede, horror books were flying off the newsstands. During its peak period (1951-54) over fifty titles appeared each month. Apparently there was something perversely irresistible about these graphic excursions into our dark side, and Four Color Fear collects the finest of these into a single robust and affordable volume. EC is the comic book company most fans associate with horror; its complete line has been reprinted numerous times, and deservedly so. But to the average reader there remain unseen quite a batch of genuinely disturbing, compulsive, imaginative, at times even touching, horror stories presented from a variety of visions and perspectives, many of which at their best can stand toe to toe with EC. All of the better horror companies are represented: Ajax-Farrell, Atlas, Avon, Charlton, Comic Media, Fawcett, Fiction House, Gilmor, Harvey, Quality, Standard, St. John, Story, Superior, Trojan, and Youthful. Artist perennials Jack Cole, Steve Ditko, George Evans, Frank Frazetta, Alex Toth, Al Williamson, Basil Wolverton, and Wallace Wood contribute both stories and covers, with many of the forty full-sized covers created by specialists Bernard Baily, L.B. Cole, William Eckgren, and Matt Fox. Editors Benson and Sadowski have sifted through hundreds of rare books to cherry-pick the most compelling scripts and art, and they provide extensive background notes on the artists, writers, and companies involved in their creation. Digital restoration has been performed with subtlety and restraint, mainly to correct registration and printing errors, with every effort made to retain the flavor of the original comics, and to provide the reader the experience of finding in the attic a bound volume of the finest non-EC horror covers and stories of the pre-code era.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>With great power comes great responsibility, but who has time for that in the New York City art scene? Tim is finally realizing that his powers are not just a manifestation of his manic depression, and what better way to use them than to exact total revenge on the hipsters and jocks that have tormented him? Tune in to issue #2 of POLARITY where Tim defames and debases hipsters as only SAY ANYTHING frontman Max Bemis could write.</em></p><p><em>Each issue comes with a free download for a new original song written and performed by Max Bemis!</em></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>Tim arrives at Dr. Mays office and asks for help. He then pukes all over Dr. Mays. Tim is invited in for some pills and Dr. Mays changes clothes. Tim lays on the doctor's couch and admits that he's not really sure what happened that evening. He thinks he killed a man. Dr. Mays explains that Tim actually did kill that man. He then explains that Tim is special in that he has a superhuman form of bipolar disorder. In fact, Tim has been a case study for years and is under constant surveillance. It is presumed that the more manic Tim becomes the powerful he gets. Unable to handle this very bizarre information, Tim once again pukes on the doctor. Dr. Mays showers but is now out of shirts.</p><p>The two men sit bare chested as Tim tries to reconcile everything he's just learned. Realizing the reality of it all, Tim wonders if he should come clean and be held responsible for that man's death. Dr. Mays assures him that the organization he works for will take care of it all. No one will ever know of the man's death. Dr. Mays then gives Tim pills to sedate his powers. Tim decides to go along with this latest news for the time being.</p><p>Tim wakes up the next day and feels almost normal. He receives a text from Alexis about a dinner party at a friend's loft. He reluctantly attends. He can't stand sitting there thinking about his powers while the people around vaunt their tastes in Bob Dylan records. He then gets the idea to have some fun with his powers. He can tell Alexis is buzzed and he asks her from some drugs to kick-start his powers. She agrees. Upon exiting the bathroom he runs into Alexis who begins to introduce Tim to a guy. Tim reads the guy's mind and blurts out that he already knows who Rob is and that Alexis slept with him the night prior. He then reveals a few secrets about Alexis and then walks back to the other dinner partiers to expose their secrets. He does so and then leaves the party on a high note.</p><p>On his way home, Tim passes some street toughs that typically give him a hard time. He handily beats them all up and continues on his way. He takes a pill that night.</p><p>In the morning Tim feels great. But painting is too difficult. He takes some puffs to get his juices flowing and begins working feverishly. Tim's art broker loves it, as it seems to be a return to Tim's former style.</p><p>The next day, Tim heads to his old high school to confront a class of kids that tormented the likes of him back in the day. Sure enough, he finds some jocks picking on a geeky looking kid. Tim stops the hazing by whipping off the towel of the lead jock and bends the kid over his knee. He spanks the jock like there's no tomorrow and then leaves before the cops can show up to arrest him for beating a high school kid.</p><p>Thursday rolls around and Tim heads to a bar to hopefully bump into Lily. Dr. Mays calls and informs Tim that surveillance seems to show that Tim isn't following the pill regimen. Tim says he's got it under control and hangs up. He immediately finds Lily and attempts to flirt with her. She calls him on his sad-sack approach and he tries again. The new approach works and she gives him her number. They then share a booth as they get to know each other.</p><p>Later, Tim sits atop a roof and ponders his situation. He realizes he's been immature with his powers and decides to do something to better society with his skills. He heads to a free, trendy concert and sets his concentration on Juicebox, an entertainment star who has made a career based on militancy mixed with bling. He sneaks backstage and takes down a body guard. He enters Juicebox's room and finds a mask. He then rushes onstage and takes Juicebox's microphone. He compels Juicebox to admit that she uses blood diamonds to adorn her costumes and she does so upon hearing that he knows her supplier's name. He exits the stage content with what he accomplished.</p>",

As for who will be doing the actual art, well, that's where things get interesting (and slightly different).

Captain Jezal dan Luthar, meanwhile, is struggling to maintain his interest in the yearly fencing Contest, win the highest position with the least quantity of work, and keep his hands off his best friend's unconventional sister... The Blade Itself is the first novel in Joe Abercrombie's The First Law trilogy. It combines the best of fantasy -- adventure, mystery, magic, and an epic scale -- with realism, cynicism, visceral action, plenty of surprises, a focus on vivid characters, and a heavy dose of black humour. Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, bloody battles will be won and lost, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood. Unpredictable, compelling, and wickedly funny, The First Law is noir fantasy with a real cutting edge.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Available in print for the first time! The second chapter of the brutal, apocalyptic horror series is finally here! Written by Si Spurrier (X-Men Legacy, Silver Surfer, Extermination), this critically acclaimed volume collects the latest arc of the weekly webcomic, ongoing at Crossedcomic.com. Unable to bear life on the doomed island-sanctuary he calls home, manipulative writer Shaky has tricked his way into an expedition crew: hunting supplies among the vile, violent hordes of Crossed on mainland Scotland. But will he find what he seeks amidst the blood-stained snow - a way to stave-off numbness; a reason to go on - or will the tough decisions of leadership and the terrors of a Crossed world rob him of what little humanity he has left?

After barely surviving a super-powered bank heist gone horribly wrong, beat cop Leo Winters vowed to try and find a way to stop them. Following a lead, he discovered two lowlifes who seemed to be able to grant a person powers...for the right price. Thing is: you don't get to choose which power. It's seemingly random, a crap-shoot, a risk. And now Leo will find out just how big of a risk he took...</em></p><p><em>From Eisner Award-nominated creator Mike Carey (THE UNWRITTEN, X-MEN: LEGACY) and hot newcomer Elena Casagrande ( HULK, HACK/SLASH) with covers by Tommy Lee Edwards (Marvel's 1984) and Stephanie Hans, SUICIDE RISK is a high octane, mind-bending exploration of what it means to be a hero.</em></p>",

Ackerman and John Lennon. The book's opener, \"So... She Married Me Anyway,\" relates the moments leading up to the author's intended elopement, and is a perfect example of Baylis's prowess as a storyteller, deftly handling the layers of emotions that accompany such an auspicious event with his signature economy and restraint. In the collection's tour de force \"So... I'm Standing on the Deck of the USS Intrepid,\" Baylis revisits the historic battleship with his uncle, who served on the ship during Vietnam. Four additional tales round out the collection. With a cover by T.J. Kirsch (Uncle Slam Fights Back by Oni Press), So Buttons #2 features color and black-and-white interior art by Kirsch, David Beyer Jr. (Tales of the Starlight Drive-In by Image Comics), and award-winning illustrator Tim Ogline.</em></p>",

Not a single monster has set foot on his New York prep-school campus. But when an innocent game of dodgeball among Percy and his classmates turns into a death match against an ugly gang of cannibal giants, things get...well, ugly. And the unexpected arrival of his friend Annabeth brings more bad news: the magical borders that protect Camp Half-Blood have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and unless a cure is found, the only safe haven for demigods will be destroyed. In the follow-up to the wildly popular The Lightning Thief, The Graphic Novel, Percy and his friends must journey into the Sea of Monsters to save their camp. But first, Percy will discover a stunning new secret about his family--one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke. Featuring a faithful adaptation by Robert Venditti, stunning artwork by Attila Futaki, and sumptuous colors by newcomer Tamas Gaspar, Rick Riordan's blockbuster book comes to life in The Sea of Monsters, The Graphic Novel.</em></p><p>Available in hardcover and softcover.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em><strong>Eye of the Majestic Creature Vol. 2</strong> is the second book collecting Leslie Stein's loose, funny and charming autobiographical narratives that combine idiosyncratic fantasy and stark reality. Larrybear, our hero, has moved from the countryside to the city, where she finds work as a shop girl. Quotes from Theodore Dreiser's <strong>Sister Carrie</strong> are sprinkled throughout the story to add humor and poignancy. Stein then takes us back to a childhood in the '80s filled with odd experiences including joining a rock band with older people, sitting in on her mother's AA groups, and the mystery of the disappearing gumballs. Finally, a fun story in which Larrybear and her new friend Poppin the Flower go on a strange trip to see his father. Let us not forget that Marshmallow, Ping-Ping and Mimolette, Larry's walking and talking instruments, have adventures all their own.</em></p><p><em>Stein's gorgeous cartooning, highlighted by incredibly detailed stippling, and her dry sense of humor combine to make one of the most unique and immersive narrative experiences in comics.</em></p>",

Exciting, innovative, and beautifully drawn romance stories by two towering titans of the field (and originators of the genre). In such best-selling titles as Young Love and Real Western Romances, Simon and Kirby delighted a generation of girls and women (and probably a fair number of boys and men as well) with hundreds of charming and endlessly inventive stories of love and heartbreak. This never-before reprinted material painstakingly restored in full color and edited by Michel Gange. So get out your handkerchiefs and enjoy the trials, tribulations, tragedies and triumphs of Suzi, Marjorie, Annaliese, Toni, Kathy, Sari... and 15 other star-crossed young lovers from half a century ago. </em></p>",

He's a self-made slacker who some might call a bum, but he calls perfect. After all, he doesn't need much, some good tunes, a couple of bucks, and a warm spot to take a nap in. Of course, his sort-of-maybe-wannabe kids keep getting into trouble with the most insane killers imaginable. It's enough to give a guy cancer just thinking about it. But this unharmable likable bumpkin has to get his act together and help the kids before social services splits them up or a secretive Hollywood society of killers turn them into ground beef. Explosive and imaginative crime noir as written by a master of the genre, Eisner Award-winning writer David Lapham. Collects issues #7 - 12 of the Dan the Unharmable series.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The 1939 creation of the Sub-Mariner for the first issue of <strong>Marvel Comics</strong> assures Bill Everett a place in history. Co-creating Daredevil, the Man Without Fear, for Marvel Comics in 1964 gave Everett a link to one of the most popular superheroes of the past 50 years. And producing over 400 additional pages of superhero-related work in the very early days of the Golden Age of Comics (1938-42) makes Bill Everett a legend.</em></p><p><em><strong>Heroic Comics: The Bill Everett Archives Vol. 2</strong> collects over 200 pages of never-before-reprinted work from such titles as <strong>Amazing Mystery Funnies</strong> (1938), <strong>Amazing-Man Comics</strong> (1939), <strong>Target Comics</strong> (1940), <strong>Heroic Comics</strong> (1940), and <strong>Blue Bolt Comics</strong> (1940). These titles feature an endless array of vintage Everett characters such Amazing-Man, Hydroman, Skyrocket Steele, The Chameleon and many more, all produced by Everettâs shop Funnies, Inc. for such clients as Centaur, Novelty Press, and Eastern Color. This book also features, reprinted for the first time, the rarest of Everett material, his romance work from the early 1950s for Eastern Color on titles such as <strong>New Heroic Comics</strong> (1950/51) and <strong>Personal Love</strong> (1953). All of the stories within display Everettâs brilliant cartooning and energetic storytelling growing by leaps and bounds.</em></p><p><em>Edited by best-selling author and comic-book historian Blake Bell (<strong>Strange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko</strong>), <strong>The Bill Everett Archives</strong> is a stunning companion to Bellâs 2010 critically acclaimed Everett biography and art book, <strong>Fire and Water: Bill Everett, The Sub-Mariner and the Birth of Marvel Comics</strong>. This volume follows the format of Bellâs <strong>Steve Ditko Archives</strong> series; never-before-reprinted, beautifully restored, full-color stories from one of comic booksâ greatest visionaries and most accomplished artists. This book also includes an introduction about the man, his art, the history of the era, and his relationship with Marvel Comics.</em></p>",

Caught in the center, five strangers have banded together and made their choice to stand for freedom or die in the last battle of World War Three.â¨For the first time, this giant graphic novel collects two rare miniseries of the continuing saga, Twilight X: Storm and Twilight X: War, into a massive, 480-page volume of post-apocalyptic action.

            "description": "<p><em>Bridging the gap between Plastic Farm Part One (Sowing Seeds on Fertile Soil) and Plastic Farm Part Two (Seasons of Growth in the Fields of Despair), this 120 page masterpiece of a graphic novel is sure to wreck your brain and make you question your own place in the universe.</em></p><p><em>April, 1972. Living on a compound surrounded by those who have rejected the reality that modern society has imposed upon us all, Jonathan Picanos has begun to experiment with new forms of meditation and self-mutilation. His friends, while recognizing that Jonathan has become adept at his mastery over nature, do not realize the depths to which he has gone. When a new threat to their way of life emerges from the shadows, will Jonathan's mastery over reality save his friends and family, or will he lead them all to death and damnation?</em></p><p><em>April, 1998. Eliza Dorne is an assassin and, while she is quite good at her job, wishes to retire. She has completed what she hoped was her final mission, but her employer (a man known by many names, but most commonly known as The Reverend or The Smiling Man) is not so eager to let her go.</em></p><p><em>April, 1994. Frank and Benny were two honest cops killed while staking out the handoff of medical files between a junky and The Smiling Man. Now they find themselves resurrected and performing menial tasks as an undead zombie-like janitorial staff.</em></p><p><em>Three seemingly unrelated tales detailing three separate events that will reshape the lives and realities of all who dare enter the world of Plastic Farm.</em></p><p><em>Written by Rafer Roberts, with artwork by Wendi Strang-Frost and Jake Warrenfeltz.</em></p>",

His life is further complicated when he happens upon a mysterious crystal shard the same night he discovers a new comet.

            "description": "<p><em>Julia, a girl from a noble family, is kidnapped by the Visigoths, who have attacked the Roman Empire, and is turned into a slave. Between the customs of the savage tribe and heavy labor she is not used to, she is on the verge of despair. Her master, Wulfric, the King of Wolves, speaks to her with arrogance-until she turns into a totally different girl from who she initially was. A wild kiss stolen in the bath lights up the flame of love in her heart for the first time in her life. All she thinks about are his shining green eyes and his robust body. He is an enemy, and she is just a slave...</em></p>",

This collection of volumes five through seven includes an art book featuring Shouji Satoâs early art and addition illustrations from Highschool of the Dead and Triage X! A mysterious illness is spreading rapidly through the halls of Fujimi High School. In a matter of hours, the campus is transformed from a place of learning into a hive of nightmares, as the infected students collapse and are reborn as flesh-hungry zombies! Only a handful of students escape the initial outbreak â among them Takashi Komuro and his childhood friend, Rei. He manages to protect Rei from the initial onslaught, but how long can Takashi and the other students hope to survive when the whole school â maybe the whole town â is out for their blood?!</em></p>",
