            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Acclaimed novelist Jodi Picoult continues her WONDER WOMAN run as America goes to war. As the Amazons invade America, Wonder Woman and Nemesis make an unlikely pair as they struggle to understand why their world has exploded while staying alive! An old nemesis of Wonder Woman's enters the fray, but even this threat pales in comparison to what the Amazons have unleashed. And when Nemesis makes a dangerous gamble in his quest for the truth, he discovers a danger way over his head!</p><p>The Amazons have begun their attack on Washington. Hippolyta asks Athena for wisdom. She is told that the worst way to keep peace is to start a war. Superman arrives just in time to catch part of the Washington Monument. When Wonder Woman arrives with Nemesis, Superman, Batman, and Black Carary ask her if it's really her mother, Hippolyta tht is leading the war. Wonder Woman says that it has to be a fake. They try to understand why the Amazons would attack now. Wonder Woman thinks that maybe it's because she was wrongly imprisoned.</p><p>Wonder Woman takes Nemesis to confront her alleged mother. She is allowed to see her, alone. Hippolyta asks if she's okay. Wonder Woman tells her that she is, she is free from custody. Diana tries explaining that they are attacking innocent people. Hippolyta says that they want to steal their weapons and technology. They have a poison that will affect those with human blood. Agents from the Department of Metahuman Affairs arrive. Nemesis is suspicious of Sarge Steel since he has lied to him twice recently. He tricks him into answering a question incorrectly and knows it must not be him. Wonder Woman warns him just as an explosion erupts around them. When the smoke clears, there's two Sarge Steels standing there. Nemesis has taken on his image. Nemesis suggests that they are both arrested and taken back to headquarters.</p><p>Diana sees Circe watching over the fight. She demands to know what she did to her mother. Diana is convinced that her mother must be possessed or something. Circe says that being dead just makes you weird.</p><p>Back at headquarters, the fake Sarge Steel is able to convince the agents that he is the real one. He takes a pen and stabs Nemesis in what should be a fake metal hand. He goes to interogate the man they have in custody. He asks him where \"you-know-who\" is, refering to the real Sarge Steel. The man tells him he is safe and introduces himself as Everyman. He pushes a button on his wrist and disappears right in front of the fake Sarge Steel. In the control room, it is seen that a nuclear missle is being readied for launch at Themyscira.</p><p>Wonder Woman continues to fight Circe saying that her mother would never attack the people. Circe talks in circles trying to confuse Diana about who she is and who her mother is. Circe tells her that just about everything has gone according to her plan.</p><p>Nemesis seems to have escaped. He rushes back to Wonder Woman and wonders why things are happening. He wonders why a nuclear missle is aimed at the sky and why the computer said it was aimed at Themyscira since it's not even in this dimension. He wants to know why Everyman would want to kill the Amazons and who he's working for. Seeing Wonder Woman battling Circe, he figures that she must be behind it all. He tells her everything that is going on. Circe admits that she gave her fake Sarge Steel the coordinates to Themyscira. When the time comes, she will cast a spell that will open the portal to Themyscira and let the missle in to destroy it. Circe is stabbed with a spear and called a traitor. Hippolyta is furious for having been betrayed by Circe. Circe begins to fade away and tells Diana that her mother isn't the woman she knew. In order to stop the war, she has to usurp her mother. Diana says that in order to usurp her mother, she would have to kill her.</p>",

His program involves rehabilitating convicted super-villains and allowing them to serve prison time serving the government. His new members include Earthshaker, Mr. Abnormal, and Killerwatt. The team leader is the former assassin, Kaine. Hill tells Weadon that her superiors have a mission for them regardless if he thinks they're ready or not.</p><p>Spider-Girl is web-swinging her way to school. She is on cloud 9 now that she has her parents blessings to continue to be Spider-Girl and also because her father has made more web-fluid for her. Arriving at school, her friend, Courtney is determined to find out why her boyfriend, Moose, hasn't been calling her since he's moved in with his uncle. She doesn't know that his dad has been diagnosed with cancer. She also found out that he's going to be the Midtown Medical Center. It turns out she skips class to go see him.</p><p>In Manhattan, Kaine speaks with Darkdevil about the mission. He wants someone he can trust to watch his back. Darkdevil asks if he's going to bring in Spider-Girl since the route they're taking, delivering something called Specimen 297, will be going through her \"territory.\" Kaine says, absolutely not. Between the two of them and their contacts, they were unable to get any information on what Specimen 297 is.</p><p>At the Parker home, Mary Jane receives a call from May's vice-principal, Mr. Slattery. He offers her a job at Midtown High. In the background, little Ben is seen trying to shake off a toy block that seems to be stuck to his hand...</p><p>At the hospital, Courtney finds where Moose is. He is in his father's room with his arm around another girl. When Courtney sees this, she runs away in tears before Moose can say anything to her.</p><p>May is walking home from school, deciding to try to go to the hospital to catch up with Courtney. Suddenly her spider-sense goes blazing. She senses some danger from below. The armored vehicle transporting Specimen 297 is attacked. In the confusion, some men take the specimen. This makes Mr. Abnormal upset as his ego is being pushed with someone stealing from him.</p><p>A fight over Specimen 297 erupts in the sewers. The team of reforming villains is getting beat when Spider-Girl arrives to turn the table. She manages to get the sphere containing Specimen 297 away from them. As they begin shooting at her, she drops the sphere, which crashes into the wall. Her spider-sense really goes haywire. The men try to take advantage of her distraction to no avail. Soon, the leader reveals herself to be the Contessa Valentina Allegro De Fontaine. This was apparently a S.H.I.E.L.D. top secret mission.</p><p>An agent rushes to the Contessa to tell her that the sphere was damaged during the fight. What was inside is now gone. She tells Spider-Girl that it was a living weapon that was thought to have been destroyed a decade ago. It was secretly being studied by the government in secrecy.</p><p>A red symbiote is seen emerging from the sewers. It seems to attack a person wearing a Midtown jacket. Carnage has been reborn!</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Don't miss this important prologue to an event that will rock the world's first and best super-team! In this issue, a fight between Wildcat and Wildcat; a firehouse pancake breakfast; Power Girl's quest to unlock the secret's behind her cousin's death; Citizen Steel's new family and the fate of Starman! And that's just the beginning as we prepare the Justice Society for their newest and most surprising member to date... </p><p>Power Girl dreams about the death of Kal-L. She is still saddened at his death during the Infinite Crisis. While visiting his grave (still in the dream), Kal-L tries to claw his way out. Power Girl wakes up and feels it wasn't just a dream but rather a premonition. She still misses him and hopes that someday, Superman will return.</p><p>Later in Brooklyn, the Justice Society are at the Fire Department for a charity event. They are serving a pancake breakfast for everyone. Citizen Steel is stuck in the kitchen with his nephew and friends making the pancakes. He compares trying to cook with kids to fighting Nazis.</p><p>Soon it is time for the main event. Wildcat vs Wildcat. Ted and his son, Tommy are set for a boxing match. Tommy isn't too keen on the idea of fighting but Ted reminds him it's for charity. Ted quickly begins knocking Tommy around, despite Tommy's quickness and agility. He mentions that his tail is telling him what move he is going to make next. At the end of the first round, Ted is clearly ahead.</p><p>The fight has to be stopped when the fire alarm goes off. The JSA agree to go and help out. There is a five-alarm fire at an old paint factory. Some firefighters have gotten trapped inside. Power Girl tells Citizen Steel he has to wait outside because of his steel costume. It will get too hot for others to touch. Tommy can smell the fighters and they work their way inside.</p><p>To their surprise, they find a dead body with a hole blasted through it. Damage and Liberty Belle recognize the body as that of a villain named Goth. They had an encounter with him a few years ago. He claimed to be a demon of sorts. Power Girl notices that the fire is coming from inside Goth's body.</p><p>Alan Scott cannot use his ring to grab the body. Somehow the fire is having an affect on it. He does note that the power that Goth possessed is about to erupt. Power Girl tells him to step aside as she moves to pull his body out of there. Alan quickly warns her to stay back because her skin is starting to burn from the flames.</p><p>Now Starman steps forward. He says he can make the body disappear. His Legion ring allows him to survive the coldness of space and the heat of the sun so he should be able to approach the body. He says that he can create a black hole to throw the body in. Power Girl asks if he's ever created one before. Starman says he hasn't but knows that he can. No one is sure whether or not the crazy Starman can actually do it. As chairwoman, the decision has to be Power Girl's. She tells him to go for it.</p><p>Starman prepares himself and begins to create the black hole. As he is doing this, he tries quieting the voices in his head. The strain of creating the black hole seems to be too much for him. The fire goes out but Starman is left unconscious. Before the hole closes, a figure falls out. He seems to recognize Starman and carries him outside. The figure asks where is he, much to the shock of the Justice Society. The figure that emerged is appears to be an older version of Superman...</p>",

When Freddy points out that civilians might get hurt, Apollo agrees, so he ties Freddy to a wire connected to an arrow that he then fires away. This causes Freddy to be pulled along with the arrow to a nearby, less crowded harbor. Freddy argues with Apollo as they fight, trying to make him realize what's at stake if the latter neglects to assume the fallen <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40307\" href=\"/atlas/4005-40307/\">Atlas</a>'s duties. Apollo in turn maintains that his life as a mortal is more fulfilling than anything he could experience as a god, and that he's saving lives as a doctor. Apollo insists that living as Atlas, constantly and subtly preventing disasters throughout the world, is not a life at all, but only servitude. He also argues that his pursuit of a mortal existence is no different than Freddy's seeking of the powers of Shazam, as both believe achieving their goals would give their own lives meaning.</p><p>When Apollo causes Freddy to accidentally set fire to a boat, the god saves the present civilians with a fire-negating arrow. Apollo then accepts his fate, and assumes Atlas's helm. However, Apollo requests that Zareb create a 'shadow essence' to take his place in his mortal family, so they won't know he's gone. Freddy, channeling the wisdom of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-35092\" href=\"/solomon/4005-35092/\">Solomon</a>, regrets to explain that once Apollo accepted his godhood, his children ceased to exist. Apollo keeps his promise, and grants Freddy some of his power, but still intends to return to his mortal life in the future. Until Freddy has found a replacement, Apollo would only grant him half of the power, the rest of the power going to someone else.</p><p>Sabina, the other competitor for the power of Shazam, finds herself slightly more powerful than before, now being able to fully transform into her superpowered state.</p>",

Well, maybe not, but that means you’ve no competition for a date with the likes of the Prowler in his first appearance; the beautiful Black Widow seen for the first time in her sultry new spy gear; an underworld family in-fight between the Kingpin and the Schemer including Vanessa Fisk’s entrée into Marveldom; and the Chameleon, Electro and the Kangaroo, a poor assemblage that’s always a bridesmaid and never a bride. It’s not just the most colorful array of villains in comics, of course! There’s melodrama aplenty in the fashion that could only befit poor Peter Parker. See how Mr. Luckless himself handles not only the loss of his powers and glowing Gwen’s fear of Spidey, but how he wiggles his way out of revealing his identity right before Gwen, MJ, and the gang’s very eyes!

This volume also finds Hiroki Endo moving <strong>Eden</strong> in new directions, with new characters, settings, and technology mixing with the old. Sophia and Kenji are back, going head-to-head with Propator forces in Eastern Asia, including Propator's cyborg killers-the vicious Aeon soldiers! Elijah's father flexes some political muscle, and Kenji uses some real muscle to protect an important political figure, the leader of a minority group in China still fighting for their human rights. This is another fast-paced, roller-coaster <strong>Eden</strong> volume, with explosive action, science fiction twists, incredibly violent surprises, and morsels of philosophical debate.</em></p>",
