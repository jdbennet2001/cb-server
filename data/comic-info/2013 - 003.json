This critically acclaimed series, written by famed Marvel/DC writer Marv Wolfman, takes Greek mythology to a new level. Greek mythology has documented the nine Muses, the inspirational daughters of the almighty Zeus. But history forgot one-- the Tenth Muse. Emma, Brett, and Dawn were the best of friends-- until Emma disappeared, leaving only a note saying goodbye. Now, eight years later, Emma is back, without answers. What happened to Emma? What is her connection with Grayson Bishop and, most of all, how did ordinary Emma Sonnet become the mysterious TENTH MUSE? Introducing The Tenth Muse, a new kind of super-hero saga unlike anything you've ever seen before. A mystery. An action series. A character-driven saga that will bring you to the edge of your seat. See if you can unravel the mystery of The 10th Muse. We apologize for the blurred cover image, but there is a new celebrity modeling as the Tenth Muse, and it has to be kept a secret until she makes it public!</i></p>",

Now, with the discovery of a revolutionary new geological element, both sides fight tooth and nail for the materials that will keep them one step ahead of the other in an escalating arms race that will-- unbeknownst to all-- lead to the ruin of the planet...

How does the world respond?</i></p><p><i>How do the kids of the Future Foundation feel about these new grown-ups running the show?</i></p><p><i>And what does Scott Lang have in store for Doom? The war begins...</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>The Future Foundation stares at a man claiming to be Johnny Storm. This far older version explains that the Fantastic Four have died at the hands of an amalgamation of Dr. Doom, Kang the Destroyer, and an Annihilus. This amalgam is called Doom the Annihilating Conqueror. He pointedly asks Ant-Man what is to be done with Doom from this time in Johnny's past. Ant-Man asks that everyone find the Moloids before he does anything about this information from Johnny.</p><p>Underground, the Moloids approach Mole Man. It seems he and the children have made a pact: Mole Man disturbs the FF while they get him a Starheart. They rise to the surface and see She-Hulk, for whom they seem to hold special.</p><p>Darla Deering resumes her role as a pop star. She hates herself, though, for how fake her act actually is. After a shower she throws on a towel and admires the flowers sent to her dressing room. She sees a pathetic arrangement sent by Ant-Man with a card that explains that the team needs her. Unbeknownst to her, Ant-Man shrunk and stowed aboard the flowers to make sure she got them. Darla reads the note and begins crying (which makes Ant-Man feel like a creepy fool). She hears a knock at the door and receives a package from the Yancy Street Gang. Hearing who the package is from, Ant-Man enlargens and covers Darla as the package explodes with whipped cream. Three masked men (obvious Yancy Streeters) enter the room and snap a picture. Ant-Man and Darla run after them to retrieve the pictures.</p><p>At the Baxter Building, Wyatt Wingfoot observes the newly arrived Johnny Storm. He approves while Medusa expresses some reservations.</p><p>Back at the concert hall, Ant-Man and Darla chase the three hooligans. Ant-Man takes the stairs and nearly catches the men. Darla takes an express elevator. She opens a door and flattens two of the men. The third races out into the New Year's festivities and gets away. The two wander the crowd for a minute before Ant-Man asks Darla back into the group. They are going to need her help in killing Dr. Doom.</p><p>Darla returns to the Future Foundation and Ant-Man makes his idea known to everyone: the energies of the Future Foundation will be in destroying Dr. Doom.</p>",

Written by Matt Wagner, award-winning creator of Grendel and Mage, and co-created with Thomas Tull, executive producer of 300 and The Dark Knight, this third installment of The Tower Chronicles continues the compelling tale of John Tower, a supernatural bounty hunter who tracks down the spectral terrors that would dare wreck havoc on our unsuspecting world. Now, as our hero travels back home from his last mission in Europe, Tower finds himself stalked by a sultry vixen who wants more from him than just a good time-her desire: his very life. Meanwhile, his unofficial \"partner,\" FBI agent Alicia Hardwicke, continues to uncover pieces of Tower's mysterious past. What secrets can a man who hunts poltergeists, demons, and other unfathomable evils possibly have that are even more chilling than his prey?

            "description": "<p><i>The Absolute Ultimate Gutters Omnibus Volume 3 is the newest collection of the wildly popular Gutters comic. Written by Ryan Sohmer (Least I Could Do, Looking For Group), Gutters is a series of standalone pages that parody the comic book industry and the heroes and characters that dwell within. Each page is penciled, inked and colored by a different artist, varying from industry veterans to newcomers. Volume 3 is an over-sized full color (and glossy) printed book. With a cover by Tom Richmond (of MAD magazine fame) and a forward by C.B. Cebulski (Marvel comics wunderkind), this is a book that your customer will love.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>For years the heroes of the Marvel Universe have lived in fear that the artificial intelligence known as Ultron would one day evolve to fulfill its desire to wipe out all organic life and take over the Earth -- that day has arrived. This massive 10-part Marvel Universe-spanning event is brought to you by Eisner award-winning writer Brian Michael Bendis and comics legend Bryan Hitch.</i></p><h2>Detailed Plot</h2><p><b>WARNING: THIS SECTION WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS!</b></p><p>Luke Cage and She-Hulk argue over who's going to do a certain thing, that cultivates in Luke punching She-Hulk and carrying her over his shoulder.</p><p>An hour earlier the superheroes in the underground bunker are discussing, and reminiscing over lost allies before Captain America comes up with a plan that involves selling one of them to Ultron. During this Tony goes on to discus why Ultron would bargain for super people, and during that Hawkeye argues that it's all Hank Pyms fault for creating Ultron in the first place. After deciding that selling one of them to Ultron is the only plan they have Luke and She-Hulk argue over why they should be the one to be sold, with She-Hulk getting to be sold, but Luke says that he'll be the seller then. Wolverine argues that he should be the seller, but Cap argues that he's much more value to Ultron and that Ultron would strip him down for his Adamantium to use as parts. After this Cap decides that the rest of the heroes will be moving to the mutate village in the Savage Land. The issue then jumps back to Luke carrying She-Hulk and taking her to Ultron's.</p><p>Red Hulk, along with Taskmaster, and Black Panther spying on a bunch of Ultron's. Red Hulk jumps into gear smashing one of the Ultron's and ripping it's head off, but is attacked straight away. He throws the head to Black Panther, and Black Panther and Taskmaster run off, after Red Hulk tells them to. Black Panther and Taskmaster are however caught in a blast and after checking for a pulse Taskmaster leaves with the head realising that Black Panther is dead.</p><p>Luke is brought by the Ultron's to a highly technological place where he finds to his surprise that he isn't dealing with Ultron whilst selling She-Hulk, he's dealing with Vison.</p>",

But how did Bishop get the new power?</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>Psylocke awakens to find herself in a wrecked warehouse. Storm informs her that the mysterious girl has fled and that Bishop went after her. Spiral is bound and Puck begins to prep her for transport despite her pleadings to save the girl, Ginny. Psylocke wants to help but Puck is intent on completing his contract by turning in Spiral. Storm questions whether Bishop could really kill Ginny. Knowing that he's tried to kill a kid before (Hope), the team sets out with Spiral to rescue the girl.</p><p>Aboard a plane over Los Angeles, Phantomex and Cluster bid their hijacked commercial carrier a fond adieu before jumping out to find and protect Psylocke. Unknown to them, Dark Phantomex watches their descent from the plane.</p><p>Below the city, Spiral teleports the small group into a very dark place. Puck thinks Spiral's playing games until Psylocke confirms that she had given Spiral psychic directions based on her readings from Ginny's imprint. It doesn't take long for the group to realize where they are, as a subway goes whizzing by, nearly taking out Psylocke. Once getting her bearings, Psylocke scans for Ginny. She is confused when she realizes that she is unable to register any psychic signatures despite standing mere inches from some of the group. She realizes too late that she must be being blocked; Bishop appears directly behind the team with Ginny in tow. He blasts the team. When Storm tries to retaliate she is too late, as Bishop once again ends up behind the team. He hurls Puck and grabs Psylocke, who manages to get free by cutting him in the arm. Another train barrels past and Spiral takes the chance to grab Ginny and teleport away. Psylocke and Bishop begin a fight that ends when she stabs him with her psi-blade.</p><p>Things go tragically wrong when Psylocke awakens to find herself on another world: Bishop's mindscape. She walks the tangled maze that is Bishop's mind and finds a deer in a cage. Before she can free the deer, however, she senses that she and Bishop are not alone in his mind. She looks to see a white owl and a very menacingly large bear.</p>",

Unfortunately for Brayden and his family, their troubles are just beginning, because the Himuras had a deadly rival-- the GHOST CLAN-- a vicious and deadly group of ninja who've been searching for the Shadow Clan for centuries...and now they've found them!</em></p><p><em>Writer David Wohl is joined by the artistic talents of Cory Smith and colorist John Starr, as they bring to you the thrilling new adventures of the LEGEND OF THE SHADOW CLAN!</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Part 3 of the incredible horror anthology Four Color Fear! This installment includes haunting stories from luminaries like Wallace Wood, Joe Kubert, Frank Frazetta and more, as well as a stunning cover gallery! Of the myriad genres comic books ventured into during its golden age, none was as controversial as or came at a greater cost than horror; the public outrage it incited almost destroyed the entire industry. Yet before the watchdog groups and Congress could intercede, horror books were flying off the newsstands. During its peak period (1951-54) over fifty titles appeared each month. Apparently there was something perversely irresistible about these graphic excursions into our dark side, and Four Color Fear collects the finest of these into a single robust and affordable volume. EC is the comic book company most fans associate with horror; its complete line has been reprinted numerous times, and deservedly so. But to the average reader there remain unseen quite a batch of genuinely disturbing, compulsive, imaginative, at times even touching, horror stories presented from a variety of visions and perspectives, many of which at their best can stand toe to toe with EC. All of the better horror companies are represented: Ajax-Farrell, Atlas, Avon, Charlton, Comic Media, Fawcett, Fiction House, Gilmor, Harvey, Quality, Standard, St. John, Story, Superior, Trojan, and Youthful. Artist perennials Jack Cole, Steve Ditko, George Evans, Frank Frazetta, Alex Toth, Al Williamson, Basil Wolverton, and Wallace Wood contribute both stories and covers, with many of the forty full-sized covers created by specialists Bernard Baily, L.B. Cole, William Eckgren, and Matt Fox. Editors Benson and Sadowski have sifted through hundreds of rare books to cherry-pick the most compelling scripts and art, and they provide extensive background notes on the artists, writers, and companies involved in their creation. Digital restoration has been performed with subtlety and restraint, mainly to correct registration and printing errors, with every effort made to retain the flavor of the original comics, and to provide the reader the experience of finding in the attic a bound volume of the finest non-EC horror covers and stories of the pre-code era.</em></p>",

The other long story, \"The Sheriff of Bullet Valley,\" plunks Donald and the nephews in the Wild West, with Donald as an overconfident deputy having to deal with some high-tech rustlers. The book also includes the less-known \"In Darkest Africa,\" originally published in a giveaway and unreleased for decades.</em></p><p><em>This volume also features an even 10 of Barks's dynamic \"Walt Disney’s Comics and Stories\" 10-pagers, including \"Wintertime Wager\" (the first appearance of a not-yet-lucky-but-still-obnoxious Gladstone Gander); \"Spoil the Rod\" (in which the exquisitely named educational professor Pulpheart Clabberhead is brought in to help tame the nephews); \"Rocket Race to the Moon\" (a rare full-on adventure — interplanetary, no less — in the short form); \"Gladstone Returns\" and \"Links Highjinks\" (two more Gladstone yarns); and five more stories... plus a half-dozen hilarious one-page gags.</em></p><p><em>Of course, once again all the stories have been shot from crisp originals, then re-colored (and printed) to match, for the first time since their original release over 60 years ago, the colorful yet soft hues of the originals — and of course the book is rounded off with essays about Barks, the Ducks, and these specific stories by Barks experts from all over the world.</em></p>",

And if the cover art looks familiar (it should!), that’s because the talented Cassandra Jean, artist of the Beautiful Creatures manga, has done an outstanding job bringing <strong>Miss Peregrine</strong> to life!

            "description": "<p><em>As Tim starts to become comfortable with his new powers, he begins fighting the good fight unconventionally, attacking evils relevant to people of his generation. Meanwhile, Dr. Mays seems to have his own plans for Tim...</em></p><p><em>Issue #3 of POLARITY is teeming with even more dark humor and commentary on the life of an indecisive 20-something year old as only SAY ANYTHING frontman, Max Bemis could write.</em></p><p><em>Each issue comes with a free download for a new original song written and performed by Max Bemis!</em></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>1970: A little boy approaches his mother's room and sees her sitting in a corner. The boy complains of hunger and the mother turns on him with a knife. She babbles about the boy's unholy origins and how he wants to kill her. The boy begs her to stop talking crazy.</p><p>The present: Dr. Mays conducts a session with a man named Milton who is concerned about a wildebeest in his stomach.</p><p>Across town, Tim dons pantyhose and downs ten Red Bulls to prepare for his next heroic act. He scales a building (by thrusting his hands into the brick) and jumps through a window where a local thug is selling cocaine to two hipsters. Tim slaps the man around until he passes out. One of the hipsters pees himself.</p><p>Another day, Tim and Lily take a walk in the park. Tim admits that he is looking to change the world with his gifts. Lily is impressed and the two inch closer for a first kiss. Tim's phone rings. Dr. Mays has an emergency and needs to see Tim immediately. Tim promises to tell Lily a bit later why he has to run off and ruin the moment.</p><p>In Dr. Mays's office, Tim receives some shocking news: Dr. Mays wants to abort their experiment and have Tim live on pills permanently to quash his superpowers. Dr. Mays is concerned about the risks Tim has been taking and wishes for things to go back to how they were before. Tim agrees.</p><p>That night, Tim invites Lily along to a Monday night tradition of watching the city lights along the East River with Adam. Adam is impressed that Tim has brought Lily around so quickly and immediately begins telling embarrassing stories from Tim's past. Tim is good-natured about it all and gets a few playful glances from Lily. Out of nowhere, however, a monster latches itself to Adam's neck and kills him. Lily stomps on the little creature and she and Tim run for their lives.</p><p>They hide in an alley and Tim begins to explain his superpowers. Before he gets too far, however, Dr. Mays calls. Relieved, Tim asks what is going on. Dr. Mays then walks into the alley and explains that he's pulling the plug on Tim, permanently. Tim is too much of a loose cannon to be allowed to operate on his own and he must be killed. (Adam had simply gotten in the way.) Tim's pills wear off and he can read Mays's mind and sees tons of horrific images, including a little boy killing his mother. Dr. Mays acts indifferent and walks off as he explains that Tim is not the only special person he has visits with. Tim and Lily look down the alley and see Milton. Milton spews a horde of demonic monsters that head towards Tim and Lily.</p>",

As for who will be doing the actual art, well, that's where things get interesting (and slightly different).

This never-before reprinted material painstakingly restored in full color and edited by Michel Gange. So get out your handkerchiefs and enjoy the trials, tribulations, tragedies and triumphs of Suzi, Marjorie, Annaliese, Toni, Kathy, Sari... and 15 other star-crossed young lovers from half a century ago. </em></p>",

Hale focuses on the Reed family (all of the children in this family survive), and their father, James Reed, is a central figure in the story. It's hazardous, it's got a lot of funny moments, it's got kids in central roles - and it's America's favorite gruesome horror-history story.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Featuring a Danny Hellman cover inspired by EC Comics Tales from the Crypt, So Buttons #3 opens on ground familiar to fans of Baylis's work, as the writer keeps to his auto-bio-storytelling roots. But it is a story rife with horrific underpinnings. In \"So... I Went to L.A.,\" the writer and a former girlfriend discover a body during what was supposed to be a relaxed, intimate getaway to solidify their relationship. Thus, it serves as the perfect transitional piece into the realm of horror. Thomas Boatwright's moody art sets the tone, nicely balancing the real world with the terrifying thoughts of \"what could be\" that fill the couple's heads.</em></p><p><em>Vampire fans disillusioned by the over-saturation of the genre in recent years will revel in the second story's decidedly different take on the bloodsucking theme. \"In the Old Fashioned Way\" is a tale with a disturbing premise that leads to a terrifying twist. Artist David Beyer Jr. has a straightforward style which makes the unsettling nature of the tale all the more pronounced..</em></p><p><em>Beyer Jr. stays onboard for the volume's third feature, \"In the Head, Please!,\" Again, Baylis tackles a seemingly tired genre-this time zombies-in a wholly new and refreshing way, a way that acclaimed Billy Dogma creator and The Quitter collaborator-with Harvey Pekar-Dean Haspiel quoted as being \"Fucked\" and having \"a nice twist.\" Beyer employs a style more reminiscent of classic EC Comics, utilizing a thicker brush stroke, and richer, deeper grey tones, fittingly suited to the story's more grotesque bent.</em></p><p><em>Baylis wraps up the anthology on a lighter note that displays both his skewed sense of humor and his passion for films. In \"In the Heat of Battle,\" Baylis celebrates the recent discovery of Thomas Edison's Frankenstein with a offbeat tale of how a \"familiar\" movie lover's incessant ramblings whilst playing chess with a zombie ultimately prove his undoing. Artist T. J. Kirsch's deft hand and muted palette compliment the two-pager brilliantly.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Dick Briefer's Frankenstein for Prize Comics is widely regarded as being America's first ongoing horror series. Indeed, it was Briefer's work that probably caused the creature to be actually named as Frankenstein instead of the nameless monstrosity from Shelley's novel. Splitting the stories between two stools - humor and horror - Briefer's tales are absorbing and unsettling in equal parts. Some of the humorous material has already been reprinted, though not necessarily in order nor in total. Until now, of course! This volume collects stories published between 1945 and November/December 1946.</em></p>",

So be warned, this hilarious romp isn't for children; instead, Crayon Shinchan is an adult, tongue-in-cheek poke at modern domestic life. Crayon Shinchan is an international cultural phenomenon and one of the best-selling Japanese manga franchises of all time. The animated version previously aired on Adult Swim and is back in print! Now readers can enjoy it from the beginning in a new, consolidated format made up of three volumes.</em></p>",

His work on the Mighty Thor swept the Norse God of Thunder to heights never before seen and rarely achieved in his wake. Spanning epic tales of heroism and treachery, love and war, Simonson's work is often considered the definitive Thor. From the majesty and mystery of fabled Asgard to the gritty streets of New York City, Thor was never the same. That is the mark of a true visionary. This third volume continues the collection of Simonson's epic run - completely remastered from the original artwork and newly colored by Steve Oliffe! Collecting THOR (1966) #357-363 and BALDER THE BRAVE #1-4.</em></p>",
