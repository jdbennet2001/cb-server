            "description": "<p><i>The top Rogues haven't been on speaking terms for a while, so who's uniting them as one voice to take down the Flash? This issue kicks off a battle so brutal, we had to call it \"Full Throttle\"!</i></p><p>Bart is still in shock as he sees his Grandmother Iris holding a gun to him. Zoom, still in his clutches smiles a psychotic grin. Iris shoots three times and Bart is able to see that she's shooting darts at him. That's a little bit of a relief. As he grabs one in mid-air, Zoom runs up behind him. As he jumps at Bart, he begins to say that they are trying to help him. Bart doesn't believe it and hits Zoom in the neck with the dart. He is out cold. He turns to his grandma and demands some answers.</p><p>Inertia continues his recruitment drive and catches up to a running Captain Cold. Cold says he's tired of all the speedsters. Inertial says he'll give him the names of the next ten Super Bowl champions just for listening to his plan.</p><p>Iris apologizes to Bart. She was hoping they could catch him off guard. She says she shot at him for his own good. Zoom agreed to help her take Bart out of super-heroing temporarily. The darts were designed to make speedsters powerless for about a week. Bart wants to know what's supposed to happen this week.</p><p>Inertia's next stop is at the Jura Canton Prison in Switzerland to pay a visit to Abra Kadabra. He doesn't want anything to do with a plan of being part of the Rogues. Inertia says he's never been part of a plan made by him. He says he'll give him a chance to pull the biggest trick of all time. It'll be a trick that will make history. Abra Kadabra is interested. Inertia says he can get him out.</p><p>Iris continues to talk to Bart. She explains that she's learned that the future isn't as reliable as she thought. Just the fact that Bart is the Flash has made her rethink everything. She doesn't want to tell Bart what is going to happen and feels she's already said to much. Bart wants to know what she's protecting him from. Iris answers that it's not \"what\" but rather \"who.\"</p><p>In Keystone City, Inertia is battling the Weather Wizard to get his attention. He says he just wants to make a point to him. He then takes the Wizard's wand and tells him it's his crutch. He asks him to think about how could his infant son have control over the weather without a wand. Inertia says it's because he has his genes but not the mental blocks that he has. To prove his point, he snaps the wand in two. He says he has 30th Century psychological therapies that can easily remove his mental blocks.</p><p>Iris tells Bart the whole story. He says that it's not her decision to make but rather his. He says that however it turns out, he's okay with it. After he calms her down, he races off to the police academy. He's late but runs into Val. She says she's thought everything over and wants to try things again. Bart is happy but can't take the risk of her getting hurt. He tells her the timing is bad and that it's not a good idea for them to get together at this point.</p><p>Inertia sits in a wharehouse with all the Rogues he's gathered including Mirror Master, Heat Wave, and the Pied Piper. He begins to tell them all his plan. He wants to build a structure on the foundation of the Getty Center and they will all make history.</p><p>As soon as Bart walks into his class late, his instructor tells him to turn around and go to the Parker Center because Robbery-Homicide wants to talk to him. He meets with Detectives Nolan and McCain. They tell him he has some explaining to do at the same moment the Rogues begin their attack on the Getty Center. They ask Bart why Steppenwolf (mistakenly called \"Stepperwolf\") would smash up the academy just to break into his locker. The forensic team says all the evidence points to that. Bart tries denying the whole thing saying he has no idea. The detectives are not happy and threaten to arrest him for obstruction of justice. An officer opens the door and tells them of the attack at the Getty Center. Bart gets up beginning to say he has to leave. The two detectives say he isn't going anywhere and place handcuffs on him. They begin to read him his rights. Bart has no choice now. He vibrates his wrists to cause the handcuffs to fall off. Then he opens the secret compartment on his ring where his costume is kept. He tells them that Steppenwolf attacked his locker because he's the Flash and that he doesn't have time to stick around for any more questions.</p><h4>List of covers and their creators:</h4><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Cover</th><th scope=\"col\">Name</th><th scope=\"col\">Creator(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Sidebar Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reg</td><td>Regular Cover</td><td>Ethan Van Sciver</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Variant</td><td>Variant Cover</td><td>Tony Daniel</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>",

Tanakata Z and Quond are nowhere to be found. Guy is able to reach both of them, who are now back at their sector house, on their communicators. They willingly admit that they are taking 5 and will not be coming to assist him in the clean up. Guy tells them that after he finishes up there he's going to head straight for their house and drag them to Oa for a court martial.<br /><br />The new partners, Soranik and Iolande are on their way to a new assignment. Reports from unaligned mining planet Nibelos of Incursion by the Children of the White Lobe, state that there has been a massive suicide explosion and needs investigating. <br /><br />In sector 3889, Green Man and Stel are there investigating why an unknown vessel has been blown to bits. At first glance it appears to have been from yellow energy and is assumed to be from the \"rogue Lantern Sinestro\". As they approach the vessel Stel warns that any organic lifeforms that near the ship may trigger a simultaneous explosion due to the fluctuating radiation levels. The Green Man throws Stel closer to the ship and the ship go BOOM!<br /><br />Now on the surface of Nibelos Soranik and Iolande find themselves in the middle of a battle between the Children of the White Lobe and the locals. The Children threaten if the Green Lanterns interfere that they will begin executing each and every local since their weapons are of no use against the Lanterns themselves. Isolating all of the Children in a ball of green power, Soranik begins to question the locals as to what the Children are after.  Apparently they are after the local raw materials and more specifically the supply of Tellurium. Tellurium is a metal that has the unique property of being able to transmute mental energy into heat. The locals notify them that there is a large mine full of Tellurium just on the other side of the planet. Isolande and Soranik head for that mine in expectation of finding more of the Children of the White Lobe.<br /><br />Kilowog heads for Mogo hoping to get a little relaxation and to clear his mind. Mogo gives him advice and provides a safe place for him to vent. In the grove, Kolowog sees a vision of his people calling him to return to his homeworld for good and leaving behind the Corps. One of them in particular states that he hates the Guardians for taking him from them and challenges Kilowog to destroy the Guardians and to no longer be a puppet for their cause.<br /><br />On Rann, Vath visits a bar to get some R&amp;R himself. He is approached by a female who has apparently taken interest in him. He invites her to leave and take a walk with him outside the bar. This infuriates a local bar patron that all the army guys come and steal all of their women. As they leave Vath is approached by Isamot. This enrages Vath's female companion because her entire family was \"wiped out by the lizards\". Both Isamot and Vath leave that planet behind and head back for Oa.<br /><br />Salaak is speaking with another Lantern [name] about Abin Sur's demise after hearing the prophecy of Quill. They discuss this prophecy and what implications it may have in their current situation. He is told to immediately report any of these happenings from the prophecy directly to the Guardians and to keep the prophecy to himself.<br /><br />Returning from the cleanup on Clustral, Guy heads straight for sector house 268 Proximal. Once inside Guy is ready to bust some heads but finds something completely unexpected...</p>",

Which is exactly what an old acquaintance of Marc Spector intends to do. To survive, the man known as Moon Knight might have to look for help in unexpected places. Someone who can give him the psychological edge. Enter: The Profile.</p><p><i>The present</i></p><p>Moon Knight is in the sewers. He is badly beaten with blood pouring from his wounds. Midnight is rambling from far off saying stuff about what he's going to do to Moon Knight's body once he gets a hold of him.</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>Marc Spector is talking to his informant, the Profile. He wants to know where Jeff Wilde is. The Profile is amused that Marc is asking where the son of his former nemesis that he killed and former sidekick. Marc is set to start beating on him but hesitates. The Profile realizes that Marc has too many questions to simply beat him unconscious. He knows he has more questions than just the where abouts of a crazed former sidekick. He finds a pill on the ground and asks if it's Marc's and if he wants it. Marc doesn't say a word as the Profile pops it in his mouth. He says he knows Marc wants it but that it's not the Hero's way to be popping pills. He has no problems with it.</p><p>Marc gives him a severe punch to the jaw and kicks him in the gut and tells him to stop \"####ing around.\"</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>Marc is getting dressed as Moon Knight and sees Ray adding some cannons to the copter. Marc asks why he's doing that and Ray says it's because they're going up against a \"super-powered robot-man.\" Ray also reminds Marc that Frenchie lost his legs. Marc says that wasn't his fault. Ray just says that his mother already lost one son and doesn't want her to lose another.</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>Marc is talking to Marlene at her work. He tells her that he took her for granted and should've told her what he wanted. He says he wants her to be with him. After he's done, Marlene asks if that's all he has to say. When Marc says yes, Marlene says he can leave so she can get back to work. Marc is upset because he told her how he felt and she has no response to that. She says that he never told her <i>how</i> he felt. She wants him to stop calling her and spying on her. She says he's acting like a spoiled selfish teenager. Her boyfriend arrives and she leaves.</p><p><i>The present</i></p><p>Moon Knight pulls out a disk in the shape of a clock from his gut. Midnight says he's going to remove his vertebrae as he begins to torture him. Midnight finds this amusing because his father said Moon Knight was spineless because he couldn't kill him properly. Midnight continues to babble on including how he's also going to harm Marlene for the way she talked down to him. Moon Knight is preparing a trap as he removes his cape to set up a decoy for Midnight in the dark tunnels. As someone reaches for his cape, Moon Knight makes his move only to find that it isn't Midnight. Midnight, now dressed as Moon Knight but with a clock on his chest rather than a moon, grabs Moon Knight by the throat.</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>The Profile, blood dripping from his mouth, tells Marc that Jeff is in his father's old hideout. Marc asks if he's sure. The Profile says he's taken his father's name and costume, so yeah, he's sure. Marc tells the Profile he's down with him. The Profile says he knows he'll be back. He knows that he has other questions to ask so they might as well get it over with now. He simply says, \"She doesn't love you anymore.\"</p><p>Marc jumps back at him yelling out a string of curses at him. The Profile quickly says that she <i>could</i> love him. Marc just has to do what he tells him to do.</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>Ray asks Moon Knight if he's armed before he goes down into the sewers. Marc says yes. Ray tells him a billy club and crescent darts aren't enough. He should take a gun with him. Ray reminds Marc that Midnight's ripped people's arms off and smashed into his house. Marc says that despite being turned into a cyborg he's still a \"####y.\" Before he jumps out of the copter, he tells Ray that if anyone besides him comes out, to blow it to hell.</p><p><i>Flashback</i></p><p>Marlene and her boyfriend are met by Marc. She tells him to grow up and he mentions that she's the one \"screwing a teenager.\" He says that since she's getting older, she has to date a kid to feel young. Her boyfriend tries to come to her defense and stupidly puts an arm on his shoulder. Marc quickly and easily twists his arm behind his back as they are approached by Tony Stark and some S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers asking Marc if he can be of assistance.</p><p><i>The present</i></p><p>Moon Knight is tied to a giant clock. Midnight is slicing into his back as Moon Knight screams.</p>",

Derek informs them of the entire Hulk situation that they missed--Hulk coming back angry and demanding Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic, and Dr. Strange to be turned over to him within 24 hours. Humbug gives Derek a foreboding warning: \"You need not fear the Monster. Fear the Warrior-Beetle and his Queen.\" Derek asks the team if they would assist with the rescue and evacuation operations as they need all the super-help they can get. The team gears up to leave with the exception of Paladin who refuses to take part in a non-paying mission (especially when such events will create many paying jobs for a mercenary).</p><p>As the team leaves, Humbug rushes away to discover a horde of the children of the alien insects. Overcome by the chemical shared memories of the group (known as chemming), Humbug is carried back to his companions by Shang-Chi. One of the bugs finds the heroes and smells them, realizing that they are humans--the enemy. Humbug grabs the fleeing insect and rips it apart before the rest of the group, spreading its innards over the other heroes. Humbug explains to his confused and angry teammates that now they smell like the insects, and will be able to walk among them.</p><p><em>Killer Instincts</em></p><p>Scorpion hides on the top of a building as heroes fly high above her and evacuation crews shout down to anyone left below. On the way to her mission destination, Scorpion takes out two low-life thugs that are taking advantage of the unrest by looting local buildings.</p><p>Back on track she enters what appears to be an empty warehouse, unaware that Paladin is following her searching for a quick buck. Within the Police's long term evidence storage facility Paladin blasts her with a nearby stun gun and surveys his surroundings. Metabolizing the blast almost instantly, Scorpion aims an even larger weapon back at Paladin and tells him that it is her turn.</p>",

In the midst of all-out war, Sarge Steel has gone missing, and Nemesis is bound and determined to find his missing boss! But with Wonder Woman ready to take the battle to the heart of the enemy, will she have time to rescue Diana Prince’s boss?</i></p><p>Hippolyta has her sword up to Wonder Woman's throat but Superman picks her up with his speeds and reminds her that Nemesis needs help from the dying poison. Batman briefs Wonder Woman on the latest developments and. Oracle informs Black Canary that they have 52 minutes to stop a nuclear missile. Wildcat, Mr. Terrific and Black Canary head for the Department of Meta-Human affairs but are then attacked by Amazons.</p><p>Meanwhile, Diana asks the gods to transport her back home and she disappears.</p><p>Black Canary, Mr. Terrific and Wildcat make it to the missile launch command centre but are confronted by man-beasts which Circe has turned into to preven them from stopping the launch. Black Canary and Wildcat fight them off while Mr. Teriffic attempts to stop the launch.</p><p>On Themyscira, Diana has made it and is looking for the cure but walking through it, remembers the times when the Amazons were happy and peaceful. She then enters the royal palace where the cure for Nemesis is kept.</p><p>Back on Earth, Mr. Teriffic manages to override the launch but goes into meltdown.</p><p>On Paradise Island, Diana prays for the antidote, but nothing happens.</p><p>The three taking care of the override realises that it didn't work, and that it's still counting down and launches itself. Hawkman flies for it but fails; Green Lantern uses his ring to grab it but fails; Power Girl does the same and fails as well, and it is all up to Wonder Woman.</p><p>On Paradise Island, Wonder Woman wonders why the gods have not responded to her prayer. The hatch of the room in which she prays open up, but she realises that it's only for the missile to make its landing. She unhooks her lasso and prays to Athena to guide the missile somewhere safe, away from the island, but she has guided it towards the island. Wonder Woman is using all her might to stop it, but is unsuccessful. She reaches behind the missile to break its cords but they regenerate like curling snakes.</p><p>She then cries out and questions why Athena is doing such a thing to her. Wonder Woman finds that she has no other choice but to put herself between the island and the missile. An explosion happens, but Wonder Woman finds that she is still alive, and the island is still there. It was Athena in her physical form that stopped the missile. Wonder Woman apologises for being angry towards her and thanks Athena for stopping the missile. Athena asks why Wonder Woman is so angry towards the Gods. Wonder Woman replies that she is angry because she wonders why the Gods didn't stop the Amazons from attack Washington DC. She adds that Athena could have easily stopped it all from happening with her hand, just like she stopped the missile with her hand.</p><p>Athena replies, \"... but you seem to have forgotten, or perhaps chosen to <strong><em>ignore</em></strong>... that I am also the Goddess of <strong><em>War</em></strong>... and the Goddess of <strong><em>Strategy</em></strong>...\"</p><p>She wraps her hand around Wonder Woman, who is so small compared to Athena and says, \"... and it is for me and me <strong><em>alone</em></strong> to say how and when and why I wave my '<strong><em>mighty hand</em></strong>'!\"</p>",
