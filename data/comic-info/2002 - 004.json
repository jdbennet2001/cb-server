Haruka agrees to let Keitaro continue as landlord.</p><p>The next day, Naru attends her high school graduation. She has to deal with her classmates questions about her failing the exam, and she reminisces about the man with whom she made her promise to get into Tokyo University. She is in a sour mood as she returns home, and she snaps at Keitaro. Keitaro tries to find out what's wrong but accidentally walks in on her changing; which makes things worse. As he heads back downstairs, Kitsune catches him and tells him to get ready for the annual cherry blossom festival.</p><p>Coming back from making a beer run, Keitaro meets a mysterious man outside of Hinata House. The man disappears before Keitaro can introduce himself.</p><p>Back at the cherry blossom festival, Naru is feeling better and goes outside to join everyone.</p><p>Naru is bored and she decides to see what Keitaro is doing. She walks in on HIM changing for once, but Keitaro is still the one that gets beat up. She dresses up the turtle that Mutsumi gave them and puts makeup on it. She and Keitaro discuss names for the turtle, when Su shows up and tries to eat it. The turtle flies away(<b>yes... it's a flying turtle</b>) still wearing Naru's watch. Keitaro and Naru search the house for the turtle and they check everyone's room. Motoko reveals she is deathly afraid of turtles. They find the turtle in Su's room, but Su was trying to cook it and it flies away. They finally find the turtle relaxing in the hot springs. Reading the note that came with the turtle reveals that it is a <i>hot springs turtle</i> and likes to take hot baths once a day.</p><p>Keitaro goes to ask Motoko about her dinner duty that night, and as is customary for him, walks in on her changing. Motoko challengs him to a duel: If Keitaro wins, she will do whatever Keitaro wishes. If Motoko wins, Keitaro has to go through Motoko's Training of Hell.</p><p>They duel, and through sheer luck Keitaro manages to grab Motoko's blade and win the duel. Motoko plans to commit seppuku(ritual suicide), Keitaro says that his wish is for Motoko to be more feminine.</p><p>The other residents give Motoko a makeover and lessons in being \"lady-like\". Motoko is miserable because she's trying to be something she's not. Keitaro manages to cheer her up and she challenges Keitaro to a rematch. This time Motoko wins, but she declines to punish him. She claims that if there is a woman who is \"unfeminine\"; she must be balanced by a man who is \"unmasculine\".</p><p>Keitaro decides to get a part-time job to earn some extra money. After several tries; he finally gets a job as a waiter. Unfortunately Kitsune is there, drunk as usual, and gets him fired.</p><p>Later, he and Kitsune start talking about Naru. Kitsune reveals that Naru used to be a very poor student, until about two years ago. She fell in love with her tutor and when he left to go overseas; Naru promised to get into Tokyo University for him.</p><p>Kitsune leaves, and Keitaro tries to digest the information. It starts to rain, and Naru shows up with an umbrella. She teases Keitaro, and he asks her about her tutor. Naru admits that the promise to her tutor was the reason she was trying to get into Tokyo U. Heartbroken, Keitaro runs off.</p><p>Back at Hinata House, Keitaro and Naru get into a fight. Shinobu tells Keitaro that Naru had gone out to give him an umbrella. Keitaro tries to apologize; to no avail.</p><p>Keitaro has finally found a part-time job as a \"stuff mover\". He confides to Kitsune that he plans togive up on Tokyo U. Naru overhears.</p><p>Keitaro's new boss turns out to be the same man who had been outside of Hinata House earlier. His name is Noriyasu Seta, and he teaches archeology at Tokyo U. Keitaro's job is to help Seta deliver a stack of artifacts to the university. Keitaro meets Seta's American daughter. Her name is Sarah and she's eight years old. She is also a trouble-making brat.</p><p>After they arrive at the university, Seta rushes off to his class and forgets about paying Keitaro. Keitaro waits around for him and realizes that he also left Sarah. Sarah spends the day harassing Keitaro, until Seta finally shows up. He apologizes, but is pleased that Sarah found somebody to play with. He offers Keitaro a job as his assistant and Keitaro accepts.</p><p>Back at Hinata House, Keitaro tells Naru about his new job. To Keitaro's surprise, she is angry about him giving up on college.</p><p>Keitaro is at Hinata House watching over Sarah, while Seta is gone for the day. He introduces her to Naru and tries to convince Naru that Sarah is a major brat. Naru, of course, falls for Sarah's innocent act. Sarah forms a plan to get Keitaro in trouble with Naru by trapping him in the bath and then luring Naru in. The plan fails when Keitaro and Naru find out Sarah's embarrassing secret: she has a birthmark in the shape of a panda bear on her butt.</p><p>Seta and Sarah are grilling outside of their van. Sarah mentions that Keitaro lives at Hinata House. Seta is surprised.</p><p>Later, they show up at Hinata House. Kitsune answers the the door and recognizes Seta as Naru's former tutor. When he asks about Naru; she makes up a story about Naru traveling Eurasia. Seta is somewhat gullible and believes her. Keitaro shows up, and Kitsune realizes that Naru's former tutor is now Keitaro's boss. She decides to have some fun.</p><p>She calls a meeting of the other residents and tells them what's going on. They decide to help Keitaro by keeping Naru and Seta from meeting. Hijinks ensue.</p><p>Naru and Seta meet for a split second in the outdoor bath, but Motoko and Kitsune throw Sarah and Su from upstairs and knock the couple out. When Naru comes to, Kitsune manages to convince her it was just a dream.</p><p>Keitaro is eating lunch with Seta and Sarah at the university. They discuss Keitaro's future plans, and Seta reveals that he was a third year ronin before he got accepted to Tokyo U, also. This gives Keitaro hope and he decides to pick up an application for the next mock exam. He runs into Naru and she's happy that he's not going to give up.</p><p>Back at Hinata House, the turtle(Tama-chan) has somehow gotten hold of Seta's lighter. She flies and gives it to Naru. Naru and Keitaro reminisce about Mutsumi and Naru's former tutor. They also talk about their feelings for each other. Naru asks him if he likes her and Keitaro stammers that he guesses he does. Maybe. Naru yells at him for being such a wimp and declares that she doesn't like him at all. She then smiles, and says, \"But that's not to say I hate you.\"</p><p>They almost kiss until Seta nearly crashes his van into them. Seta climbs out of his van and he and Naru greet each other. Keitaro is confused until he realizes... Seta is the man Naru made her promise to.</p><p>The chapter starts exactly where the last one ended. Naru runs away. She's ecstatic to see Seta, but also trying to sort out her feelings for Keitaro. They catch up with Naru, and go inside to talk. Naru is being very clumsy and generally acting very Keitaro-like. Seta tells Naru that he thinks being a ronin will be a good experience for her and to cheer up.</p><p>Later, Keitaro is up on the roof and he's depressed. Naru comes up to talk to him and to apologize for before. Keitaro shocks Naru by planning to help her get together with Seta. The rest of the gang show up and decide to help Keitaro.</p><p>Hijinks ensue, but Keitaro finally proclaims to Seta that Naru likes him. Seta surprises her by saying he likes her, too. He then shocks everyone by saying he also likes Keitaro. And Kitsune. Hinta House is a great place and he likes everyone there.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 25: When the Cherry Blossoms Bloom</li><li>Chapter 26: The Hinata House Runaway</li><li>Chapter 27: Kendo Girl's Tiny Little Problem</li><li>Chapter 28: In the Downpour With You</li><li>Chapter 29: HELP!

            "description": "<p>This Volume is packed with three stories to keep a reader happy.</p><p>The first story is all about the stuffed goof ball Kon. After several days of mistreatment Kon decides that he doesn't want to be stuck with Rukia and Ichigo so he sets off on a misadventure that leads him to several people that end up just making matters worse for him. First he runs into Orihime and Tatsuki (He's more concerned with Orihime) who are playing a new hybrid game of soccer and baseball. Not watching to what is happening Kon is first caught by the ball and then sent sailing back the other way by Orihime's batting ability. In his second chance encounter Kon tries to fall like a lost toy in front of some of Ichigo's other female class mates, but is viciously stepped on by Ryo Kunieda before Michiru Ogawa can pick him up. Started by the sudden and cold reaction Kon yelps. The sudden out burst stops the girls in their tracks and makes them begin to wonder how they can profit off the capture of the odd stuffed animal. Before they can capture him Kon makes a run for it, which makes Ryo brag about how fast she is as she takes off after him. As Kon runs from the high school track star he runs across another unexpected admirer as Sado sees him and runs after him.</p><p>Exhausted from his misadventures Kon returns home to collapse on the front stoop of the Kurosaki clinic. Unsure of what is to come next Kon accepts his fate and waits to be found. Fortune seems to smile down on Kon as Yuzu comes to the door and finds him. As Kon is finally pampered as he has wished for the whole time he almost seems to melt into his cozy new life. That is until Yuzu begins fabric gluing flowers on his ear and dressing him as a girl. Kon realizes he is now worse off than he used to be and runs for Ichigo's room.</p><p>Unaware that Kon was even gone Ichigo and Rukia puzzle over what had happened and try to remove the glued on flower, making Kon plead for mercy.</p><p>In the second story Ichigo admits to not liking the massively popular new show, Spiritual Hot Springs.\" It's just too bad his friends and family don't feel the same way. Ichigo ends up following his family to a live action taping when he has to do something to help the blundering Don Kononji as he unwittingly makes a broken spirit turn into a Hollow long before it is suppose to turn Hollow. Before Ichigo can get across the barrier he is tackled by security and is unable to get to Rukia, who followed after him and is also tackled by security.</p><p>As circumstance would have it Urahara is on the spot and releases Ichigo from his body so that he can turn Soul Reaper. As a spirit Ichigo tries to knock Kononji away from the spirit but he is too late as the man vanishes and reappears as a Hollow on the top of the hospital that they were filming at. To protect Kononji Ichigo drags him away from the crowd and into the waiting room of the abandoned building. Kononji complains to Ichigo that he is ruining his rep as being a hero and tries to go back out to fight the Hollow. Without warning the Hollow attacks them inside the hospital which in turn causes Ichigo to get his Zanpaku- to caught in a low ceiling. The Hollow releases a sticky fluid that glues Ichigo to the hilt of his Zanpaku- to and tries to attack Ichigo. The Hollow is stopped by Kononji who uses most of his spirit to create a blast which frees Ichigo from the ceiling so that he can take the fight elsewhere. Ichigo runs off to fight elsewhere since he can zanpaku- to while his hands are bound. Ichigo is eventually drug up to the top of the hospital where he manages to defeat the Hollow while the crowd is distracted by Kononji. After defeating the Hollow Ichigo has a new friend in Kononji, wanted or not.</p><p>In the third tale all the students involved in the taping incident, and several who weren't involved, are corralled into the principals office by the gym teacher to explain what they were doing misbehaving at the taping. The interrogation goes awry as Ichigo and the others find different ways to sneak out and leave the gym teacher looking the villain as Rukia fakes crying. Once home Ichigo gets a visit at the clinic from his new friend Kononji. Not wanting to be seen with the odd man Ichigo and Rukia run off as a Hollow alert comes through. Incidentally Ichigo and Rukia show up and find that there is no Hollow for them to defeat, only a scared soul waiting to be cleansed. Rukia and Ichigo complain about how often the calls have been coming in as false and begin to doubt their equipment.</p><p>Back at school again Ichigo and Rukia find out that they are the center of the rumor mills as everyone has seen the episode fo Spontaneous Trips. Ichigo also has to deal with the grades posting coming out as his friend Keigo begins hassling him about his grades. Ichigo plays it off and admits to having to study hard to make himself look less problematic to the school staff since his appearance and hot head get him in a lot of trouble. Before the he can finish talking with his friends Ichigo is scooped away by ukia as she has received another Hollow warning. Ichigo and Rukia show up to vanquish the Hollow but they are meet by a new and dangerous problem. Uryu Isshida, the last Quincy.</p><p>The big problem with the Quincy? He hates Soul Reapers.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 26 - Paradise is Nowhere</li><li>Chapter 27 - Spirits AREN'T Always With Us</li><li>Chapter 28 - Symptom of Synesthesia</li><li>Chapter 29 - Stop That, Stupid!!</li><li>Chapter 30 - Second Contact (it was beyond the scope of our understanding)</li><li>Chapter 31 - HEROES CAN SAVE YOU</li><li>Chapter 32 - A Hero is Always With Me?</li><li>Chapter 33 - ROCKIN' FUTURE 7</li><li>Chapter 34 - Quincy Archer Hates You</li></ul>",

But his hidden agenda is clear: he wants to expand the K-Fight program beyond the school's campus, and does so by pitting Ryoko and four other women warriors against Shizuma and his band of brawny brawlers. Surprisingly, Ryoko not only accepts the challenge but agrees to head the group of lady fighters as well, hoping the experience helps her attain her ultimate goal of becoming a great woman.

            "description": "<p>This Volume is packed with three stories to keep a reader happy.</p><p>The first story is all about the stuffed goof ball Kon. After several days of mistreatment Kon decides that he doesn't want to be stuck with Rukia and Ichigo so he sets off on a misadventure that leads him to several people that end up just making matters worse for him. First he runs into Orihime and Tatsuki (He's more concerned with Orihime) who are playing a new hybrid game of soccer and baseball. Not watching to what is happening Kon is first caught by the ball and then sent sailing back the other way by Orihime's batting ability. In his second chance encounter Kon tries to fall like a lost toy in front of some of Ichigo's other female class mates, but is viciously stepped on by Ryo Kunieda before Michiru Ogawa can pick him up. Started by the sudden and cold reaction Kon yelps. The sudden out burst stops the girls in their tracks and makes them begin to wonder how they can profit off the capture of the odd stuffed animal. Before they can capture him Kon makes a run for it, which makes Ryo brag about how fast she is as she takes off after him. As Kon runs from the high school track star he runs across another unexpected admirer as Sado sees him and runs after him.</p><p>Exhausted from his misadventures Kon returns home to collapse on the front stoop of the Kurosaki clinic. Unsure of what is to come next Kon accepts his fate and waits to be found. Fortune seems to smile down on Kon as Yuzu comes to the door and finds him. As Kon is finally pampered as he has wished for the whole time he almost seems to melt into his cozy new life. That is until Yuzu begins fabric gluing flowers on his ear and dressing him as a girl. Kon realizes he is now worse off than he used to be and runs for Ichigo's room.</p><p>Unaware that Kon was even gone Ichigo and Rukia puzzle over what had happened and try to remove the glued on flower, making Kon plead for mercy.</p><p>In the second story Ichigo admits to not liking the massively popular new show, Spiritual Hot Springs.\" It's just too bad his friends and family don't feel the same way. Ichigo ends up following his family to a live action taping when he has to do something to help the blundering Don Kononji as he unwittingly makes a broken spirit turn into a Hollow long before it is suppose to turn Hollow. Before Ichigo can get across the barrier he is tackled by security and is unable to get to Rukia, who followed after him and is also tackled by security.</p><p>As circumstance would have it Urahara is on the spot and releases Ichigo from his body so that he can turn Soul Reaper. As a spirit Ichigo tries to knock Kononji away from the spirit but he is too late as the man vanishes and reappears as a Hollow on the top of the hospital that they were filming at. To protect Kononji Ichigo drags him away from the crowd and into the waiting room of the abandoned building. Kononji complains to Ichigo that he is ruining his rep as being a hero and tries to go back out to fight the Hollow. Without warning the Hollow attacks them inside the hospital which in turn causes Ichigo to get his Zanpaku- to caught in a low ceiling. The Hollow releases a sticky fluid that glues Ichigo to the hilt of his Zanpaku- to and tries to attack Ichigo. The Hollow is stopped by Kononji who uses most of his spirit to create a blast which frees Ichigo from the ceiling so that he can take the fight elsewhere. Ichigo runs off to fight elsewhere since he can zanpaku- to while his hands are bound. Ichigo is eventually drug up to the top of the hospital where he manages to defeat the Hollow while the crowd is distracted by Kononji. After defeating the Hollow Ichigo has a new friend in Kononji, wanted or not.</p><p>In the third tale all the students involved in the taping incident, and several who weren't involved, are corralled into the principals office by the gym teacher to explain what they were doing misbehaving at the taping. The interrogation goes awry as Ichigo and the others find different ways to sneak out and leave the gym teacher looking the villain as Rukia fakes crying. Once home Ichigo gets a visit at the clinic from his new friend Kononji. Not wanting to be seen with the odd man Ichigo and Rukia run off as a Hollow alert comes through. Incidentally Ichigo and Rukia show up and find that there is no Hollow for them to defeat, only a scared soul waiting to be cleansed. Rukia and Ichigo complain about how often the calls have been coming in as false and begin to doubt their equipment.</p><p>Back at school again Ichigo and Rukia find out that they are the center of the rumor mills as everyone has seen the episode fo Spontaneous Trips.
