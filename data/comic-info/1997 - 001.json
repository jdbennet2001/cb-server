            "description": "<p>The story of Cassidy's first visit to New Orleans, and the only other vampire he knew.</p><p>After a scuffle with the local police, Cassidy makes his way to New Orleans where he meets Eccarius, who just happens to also be a vampire. This is the only vampire Cassidy has ever met, aside from the one that bit him 75 years prior. Eccarius speaks, looks, and acts as though he's straight out of a Anne Rice novel. Cassidy quickly realizes that Eccarius is a \"wanker\" after speaking to him. Eccarius offers him blood in a wine goblet and a place to sleep in a coffin, only solidifying Cassidy's belief that the only other vampire is a complete \"wanker\". The next night, Eccarius brings Cassidy to his underground sanctuary where the group \"Les Enfants Du Sang\" live. All of them are gothic rejects that all worship Eccarius and beg to drink his blood to become vampires. One of them is Roger who reads a long poem called, \"Eccarius Becoming (Loam Dreams)\". Cassidy tells them off and shoves Roger's poem down his throat while he and Eccarius leave the underground. After a heart-to-heart, the boys go to a church, Cassidy proves the myths about Vampires wrong. They go bar hopping, get drunk and then go back to the underground to call Les Enfants Du Sang \"wankers\" while mooning them. Cassidy wakes up the next night to find Eccarius missing. Cassidy tracks him down to a church and finds Eccarius feasting on a woman. Eccarius tells Cassidy he's murdered and fed on hundreds of people and kills everyone he feeds on. Cassidy shoves a cross through his head. Eccarius wakes up later, nailed down to a roof as the sun comes up. Cassidy tells him he's going to die for being a \"self-obsessed, pasty-faced death-fixated d!ckhead got up in a poncey suit.\" Eccarius' accent is gone as he yells at Cassidy before he dies.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><ul><li>Ranked #89 in Wizard Magazine's list of \"100 Best Single Issue Comics Since You Were Born\".</li></ul>",

Before Dick Grayson can don the Robin costume as Batman's partner, he must pass a final challenge: elude Batman for an entire night within the confines of Gotham City. But his game of hide-and-seek becomes deadly when Robin stops what appears to be a simple mugging and inadvertently intercepts key information. Now he's the target of a ruthless mob boss, his deadly gang of thugs, the GCPD and, of course, Batman himself, who races to find his young ward before it's too late.</em></p><p>Dick Grayson's \"final exam\" before becoming Robin was to not let Batman catch him in the city for an entire night. In doing this, Robin also brought down a major bust on one of Gotham's crime families. </p>",

Each story is set in a particular area of London, and brings together successful comic book writers to produce a mix of styles and disciplines.</em></p><h4>SelfMadeHero Solicit</h4><p><em>Here is a cityscape of looming towers, shadowy embankments and subterranean sleaze; of public bars and private vices; of huckster artists, femme fatales and capital crimes... With strong language, and even stronger imagery, It's Dark in London is an uncompromisingly adult descent into the dark underground world of the capital. Featuring stories by creators including Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, as well as London-based writers Iain Sinclair, Tony Grisoni and Stella Duffy, this collection of graphic tales captures London's gritty essence. Edited by graphic novelist Oscar Zarate.</em></p>",

A cat that, in a dogfight with a fly, will strafe his master in her sleep. In short, Michael is a cat like any other cat. <strong>What's Michael?</strong> is an amusing look at the lives of a cats, written and illustrated by manga master Makoto Kobayashi. In this book you'll find answers to some of the burning \"cat\" questions that you've been dying to have answered, such as: Do cats always land on their feet? Do cats make good detectives? Are cats better pets than dogs? And the often-asked but seldom-answered, why do cats dance? Of course, there is more than just cats in the book. The stories show us how people interact (and often make idiots of themselves) in the presence of felines. This book is made up of short stories that allow us to look in on the lives of cats and the people who love (and hate) them.</em></p>",
