            "description": "<p>Hyperion and Nighthawk continue to investigate the serial murder of dozens of prostitutes in Chicago. Nighthawk hopes to make use of Hyperion's government connections to seek out additional information that he can't get from his own law-enforcement sources. Hyperion has quite literally burned his government bridges, and when he tells this to Nighthawk, Nighthawk says that the only other use he has for \"a guy like you\" is as muscle, and accuses Hyperion of being part of \"the system.\" Hyperion (appropriately) takes offense at this remark given his one-man war against his military and N.S.A. handlers that was precipitated by their attempt to kill him, and takes off.</p><p>Government agents inspect the ruins of Hyperion's apartment and come to the conclusion that he is declaring war against those who would use him. They start hatching a plan to bring him back under control.</p><p>Hyperion, banking on the knowledge that his falling-out with the government isn't yet common knowledge, makes a visit to the Chicago police to gain information on the killings. He learns that the killer has an unusual modus operandi, one which indicates that he would be inconvenienced if he was caught, but that he has no fear of consequences. The police have identified two possible locations based on clusters of disappearnaces: Colorado and Louisiana. They also identified a possible perpetrator, Michael Redstone, but he was listed as having died in a federal prison while serving three life sentences. As Hyperion leaves, the lieutenant calls the Federal Bureau of Investigation to report Hyperion's visit.</p><p>The Blur is also investigating the disappearances, questioning groups of street prostitutes. Hyperion holds a position in geosynchronous orbit to follow up on leads by either the Blur or Nighthawk.</p><p>Steadman informs Joe Ledger that one of the prisoners who had been experimented on and escaped has been linked by fingerprints to a series of murders. He only learned because of Hyperion's inquiries. Joe demands that Steadman tell him everything.</p><p>Nighthawk finds a lead when interrogating a pimp, older worn-out prostitutes working the worst parts of town have been going missing.</p><p>Redstone picks up another prostitute and brings her home. Nighthawk tails him to his shack, but Redstone knows that he's following and ambushes him. As he is attacked, Nighthawk remembers a conversation with his father about the order of the natural world, how things get out of sorts when predators begin hunting other predators. Redstone prepares to further torture Nighthawk when Hyperion arrives on the scene.</p><p><b>General Notes</b></p><p>Richard Isanove contributes inks to the cover only.</p>",

But now the young mutant sets her sights on the Big Apple and Empire State University, and there are many unexpected lessons to be learned in the big city. Will her new life and friends set Emma on the road to ruin?</em></p><p>Emma is currently attending college and is doing extremely well in her classes. While she was walking back to her dorm, she bumps into a guy knocking all her books down. She eventually makes it back to her dorm room where her roommate is kicking her parents out of their room. This was the first time the two of them met because Emma's roommate just recently moved in. Emma goes to her next class where she obviously knows everything by using her telepathic abilities. While leaving class she is stopped by that same guy that bumped into her and tries to ask her out. She reads his mind and knows what he is going to say and she says no, but he told her to attend his basketball game if she has time and she puts it into consideration. Emma and her roommate are eating lunch together trying to get to know each other. Emma tells her about the guy that was trying to ask her out, and then her roommate tells Emma that she is in love with someone. Emma reads her mind and realizes that it is her old professor. Emma decides to attend the basketball game with her roommate. During the game Emma began to get a major headache and left the game early with her roommate. Emma is sitting on the curb in tears not knowing what happened. Emma returns to her dorm room to rest and she begins talking with her roommate. Eventually someone knocks on the door, and when they open, it was Emma's old teacher here to pick up her roommate for a date.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>A special single-issue reunion story starring the Original New Mutants: Moonstar, Cannonball, Magma, Karma, Sunspot &amp; Wolfsbane!</em></p><p>Introducing... Agent Justin Pierce! Agent Pierce is an FBI agent who works in the Metahuman Crimes division. He has come to The Cage (a metahuman prison in France) to talk to his uncle... Donald Pierce! He says the FBI is making a deal with Pierce: They WON'T kill him, and in return he will testify against a mutant who they believe to have committed murder. That mutant's name... Kevin Ford! The cybernetic man is pleased to hear that the FBI is going after one of Xavier's children...</p><p>*<b>Donald Pierce:</b> \"...I hear the school is quite <b>vulnerable</b> right now.\"*</p><p>Splash page of the Xavier Institute. Rahne, Shan, and Dani watch in horror at the smoldering hole that used to be their home. Magneto destroyed it, and there was nothing they could do to stop him. These three helped in the evacuation of all the students, so they didnt fight Magneto. Just then, some familiar friends walk up... Its Samuel Guthrie, Roberto DaCosta, and Amara Aquilla!</p><p>As most of the group enjoys each other's company, Amara is quite moody, and is pretending not to like anyone. They talk about where they are now in life, and Roberto is surprised that Dani is a teacher, and not a fighter. Then again, Karma is surprised that Roberto is head of X-Corp LA, and not leader of the Hellfire Club.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donald Pierce is being moved from JFK International Airport in NYC to a secure location. But of course, things go awry, and he takes control of one of the transport vans. He kills everyone inside, and threatened to kill Justin Pierce, but since they're family, he doesnt.</p><p>After the original New Mutants reconnect for a while, Amara rudely demands that they all get some food, so Shan and Dani take everyone to the Grindstone. Roberto tries to hit on the lesbian manager, Luna, but it doesnt go quite as he planned. We see more allusions to Luna and Shan going out (but they still aren't yet). Dani tries to confront Amara about the way she's behaving, but they're interupted by Justin Pierce, who came to talk to Dani about Kevin Ford, and the fact that Donald Pierce is lose.</p><p>Quick scene of Donald Pierce and his Reavers getting their act together at a hotel outside of Salem Center. Duncan (from issue 5) is there, and he wants to be the one to kill Josh.</p><p>Back to the students for the first time this ish. They are all holed up in the X-Corp building in Salem Center because the school was destroyed. We see Julian, Cessily, Santo, and Victor with their sleeping bags together on one side of the room, and David, Sofia, Laurie, Josh, and Nori on the other side of the room.</p><p>Dani informs the kids about Pierce's break out, but she and Josh think up a plan. Pierce won't attack them with all the students and all the teachers together. They need to lure him out. So Josh will go to the Institute alone as bait, and then the New Mutants can take Pierce when he makes his move there. The New Mutants escort Josh to the school, and Roberto reminds Josh that Cannonball used to work for Pierce too: \"Anything's possible\".</p><p>Magma explains to Karma why she's acting like she doesn't like anyone. She lost control of her powers, and was too embarassed to contact her friends for help. And after she gained control, she was too ashamed that she didn't contact her friends about it. She just thinks she's a sucky friend. Which she is, kinda.</p><p>Rahne and Sam share a tender moment, and <i>almost</i> lock lips, but Pierce is here!</p><p>Wolfsbane pounces on some of the Reavers while Sunspot takes out some of their telepathic blocking helmets. Karma then takes out those Reavers. Rahne almost kills Duncan, but gains control of herself, and lets him go. Cannonball smashes through some of Pierce's cybernetics, and Dani takes him down. He tries to make small talk, but Magma throws some lava at him and takes him out for good.</p><p>Pierce shows up to clean up, and Dani tells Josh how proud she is of him: He ACTUALLY did as he was told, and stayed safe during the fight. The New Mutants escort him back to the X-Corp building where the kids are waiting for him. Sam offers Dani to join the X-Men, but she declines. After all, someone has to teach the next generation!</p>",

Bien qu'issus de milieux différents, les deux gamins se sont aussitôt liés d'amitié. Au retour d'une visite sur les lieux où tourne le célèbre acteur, l'hélicoptère transportant John-John et Benoît est contraint à un atterrissage forcé sur les cimes enneigées</em></p><p><em>Ce nouvel album nous permet aussi d'assister aux retrouvailles professionnelles de Thierry Culliford et Frédéric Jannin. Les deux enfants terribles de la BD belge se sont liés d'amitié sur les bancs de l'école. Ensemble, ils ont créé, à la fin des années 70, les aventures de «Germain et Nous...» dans lesquelles ils ont inventé l'inoubliable groupe des «Bowling Balls». Les deux copains d'enfance ont justement choisi de nous raconter une histoire d'amitié et on voit qu'ils connaissent bien le sujet.</em></p>",
