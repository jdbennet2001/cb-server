            "description": "<p>Several weeks ago some of the denizens of the Negative Zone are in an uproar over the \"invaders\" coming to their land.  As they rally to speak about it, a big ship lands (apparently crushing some of them) as workers prepare to get the prison built on schedule.</p><p>In the present, Black Panther and Storm look over the wreckage of the Wakandian Embassy after the Civil War.  Storm asks if they will return to Wakanda now that they do not have a place to stay.  Black Panther replies that they must deal with Washington D.C. and  work with the U.N.  He calls forth a ship that he had stored in the bay.</p><p>Maria Hill inside a S.H.I.E.L.D. hellicarrier detects their ship and asks Tony Stark why she cannot shoot down his ship for being in their airspace.  Stark mentions it's partially their fault that the embassy was destroyed. Maria says she'll give them 24 hours to leave.  Stark reminds her that it's her job to know about ships being stashed around in various places.  That shuts her up.</p><p>Some weeks ago, back in the Negative Zone, a battle is taking place between two aliens.  As one kills the other, he proclaims, \"Behold your champion!\"</p><p>T'Challa has a video conference with his officials in Wakanda.  He is being questioned when he will return and about his position in seeking help from the U.N.  T'Challa reminds them that he is the King and can easily have them relieved of their postion.  He mentions his blueprints for the new embassy with some modifications.  It will take some time to construct so there is still  the question as to where he, Storm, and their support staff will stay.<br /></p><p>At the United Nations, Storm becomes frustrated in trying to deal with the foreign delegation.  T'Challa says they have dinner plans that should get her mind off of things.  The dinner is with Reed and Sue Richards of the Fantastic Four.  They are planning on taking some time away from the team to work on their relationship.  Reed offers the use of the Baxter Building for the embassy and their positions in the Fantastic Four to help keep an eye on the Thing and Human Torch.  They quickly accept.</p><p>In Wakanda, Brother Voodoo is seeking a cannibal that devours the souls of innocents.  He has the ability to take possession of their bodies.  He is asked whether he will be willing to kill an innocent in order to stop the cannibal.  At the palace, it seems the American battle ships are moving closer to Wakanda.  In the room of T'Challa's sister, one of her men says that she needs to take charge since the King is half a world away.  She protests that it is not the way the protocals work.<br /></p><p>The newly formed Fantastic Four prepare to head out for an emergency that Black Panther discovered.  As they leave, in the Negative Zone, a revolt is taking place at the prison.  The guards are becoming overrun.  The alien champion makes it through a portal and finds himself inside the Baxter Building.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The kids continue their New York adventure and encounter someone dangerous that they’ve never met before. Hint—LOOK BEHIND MOLLY ON THE COVER. Will he punish the Runaways? Superstar Joss Whedon (Buffy, ASTONISHING X-MEN) and rising star Michael Ryan (NEW X-MEN, NEW EXCALIBUR) continue a tale that will take the Runaways somewhere they’ve never been before! PART 2 (of 6)!</p><p>As the Runaways try escaping with the stolen articfact for the Kingpin, the Punisher fights the mysteriious man with the sword. The Runaways don't know who is on who's side. As they both turn their attention on the kids, Nico finally creates a spell to make them phase through the roof of the building they're on.</p><p>The Kingpin is in his office contemplating the Punisher's involvement. He admires him for thinking he's fighting a war but thinks he's a fool for believing that he could win it.</p><p>The Runaways make it back to the Leap Frog and realize that Chase and Old Lace aren't with them. Is it possible they didn't survive the explosion? Molly thinks maybe Chase jumped when he saw the missle and Old Lace could've grabed him and used her claws to grab the building. Nico and Xavin begin to argue after Karolina goes to look for them. Then Chase and Lace climb up over the edge of the building. Chase tells them that he jumped and Lace saved him. Molly is shocked that she was right. As Nico acts \"like a girl\" and cries over Chase being alive, Molly wants to know why no one is \"awesomed\" by her guessing what happened.</p><p>The Punisher shows up behind her. Karolina asks him if he's really going to shoot kids. He says it's wouldn't be the first time. When Victor says they're not criminals, Punisher says they stole something for the Kingpin. Chase thinks that they didn't take something that doesn't belong to them. The device looks like something his parents might have built. That makes it property of the Pride. He also tells the Punisher that he can punish his ass. As the Punisher is about to shoot him, Molly punches him in the stomach.</p><p>When the Punisher begins to recover from the blow, the others are talking (some are yelling) with Molly. She didn't know he didn't have powers. The Punisher tries not to fall over as the Runaways discuss whether or not he's bleeding internally. Nico doesn't want to waste a healing spell on him since he held a gun at them.</p><p>They leave in the Leap Frog and try to figure out if Chase's parents did create the device. The Leap Frog seems to react to the device but they don't know what will happen if they put them together. They don't understand why the Kingpin would send them to retrieve it knowing that they would figure it out. They know that if they don't give it to him, he'll have them killed. Chase suggest they let Molly hit him. She says she won't hit anyone else without powers, especially if \"they've got glands.\" Following behind them is the winged man with the sword.</p><p>They return to the apartment the Kingpin lent them. They figure they have just enough time to get out of the state before they were to deliver the device. When they open the door, they find the Kingpin and heck of a lot of ninjas inside. He says he doesn't know why his client paid him a lot to have the kids steal something that is basically already theirs.</p><p>A fight begins. The ninjas are everywhere. One of them kicks Victor off the roof when the winged man grabs him. Victor threatens to mess with his mechanical wings if he doesn't put him down. The man tells him to shut up because Victor has a message to give. Nico gets slashed from behind and calls forth the staff. She makes them all fall asleep. Unfortunately, the Kingpin has already left after calling in a contact in Stark's R&amp;D department. Victor tells them they have to run. A flying robot shoots a bunch of missles at the building as they jump into the Leap Frog. Not having a choice, they insert the device into the Frog as it hits overdrive.</p><p>As they land, the Leap Frog cannot determine where they are. Nico is still bleeding badly. Chase and Victor go out to see where \"overdrive\" took them. It seems to be more of a question of \"when\" as they see the street filled with horse-drawn carriages.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>While the Marvel Universe reels from the bizarre and shocking incidents of last issue, and repercussions ripple outward, the Winter Soldier finally chooses a side, after the Civil War has ended -- his own. But what are the Red Skull and his minions up to behind the scenes, These questions and more will be answered as the most shocking Cap story so far races right through the aftermath of the Civil War!</em></p><p>Sharon and the Contessa are walking to the wake for Steve Rogers and Sharon tells her of her encounter with Tony Stark five days ago. She was standing outside of where Steve's body was being kept. She was enraged that Stark secretly took the body from the hospital. He said they had to because he was the only perfect Super Soldier specimen in the world. When Stark allows her to enter, she sees the horror of what is left of his body. Apparently when he died, the Super-Soldier serum reversed its effects. He is now a withered old man with huge bullet wounds. Crying, Sharon says, \"What did I do...?\" Stark barely heard her and asks her what she said. She turns around and asks what did he do to Steve. He starts to defend himself saying that seeing Steve like that is killing him. Sharon slaps him for saying that and quits.</p><p><i>The Wake</i></p><p>Sharon sees Falcon and they talk briefly. Other heroes are there including the Thing, Carol Danvers, Simon Williams, and Dum Dum Dugan. She runs into Rick Jones who asks her if she knew that Steve really did love her. She says yeah. She excuses herself to the ladies' room. She hears Sin's words, \"Doctor Faustus says remember.\" She looks at her hands and continues to cry. Falcon also excuses himself and flies off.</p><p><i>The Other Side</i></p><p>The Red Skull watches the news reports with his daughter, Sin. He still has more to his evil plan. Dr. Faustus wants to have another session with him since the Skull is \"sharing his mind\" with another man. The Red Skull asks Arnin Zola if he's figured out how Dr. Doom's device works. Zola believes he can crack it and reverse engineer it given time. They will be able to have access to time.</p><p><i>The Secret Wake</i></p><p>The New Avengers hold their own wake to honor Steve since they are unable to attend the actual one. Luke Cage, Spider-Man, Patriot, Ronin, Spider-Woman, Night Nurse, Jessica Jones (with their baby), Iron Fist, and Kate Bishop are joined by Falcon. Cage has words with Falcon over his being registered now. Falcon says he didn't want Steve to be buried alone. He told Stark to give him Harlem to watch over and to leave him alone. Spider-Man tells them that he's watched the footage over and over trying to figure things out. He tells them how Steve pushed the officer out of the way and took the bullet. He didn't give up at the end. He was a hero as he died. They raise a toast but Falcon is called away.</p><p><i>How It Begins</i></p><p>Bucky, the Winter Soldier sits drinking at a bar. The news is on and mention of Captain America continues to run. He can't believe that for the past year he couldn't face him and now he's gone. When the bartender mentions that it's a tragedy, another drinker says it's a cover-up and Cap is not dead. Another customer says the only tragedy is the fact that they're burrying him at Arlington, which is supposed to be for heroes, not traitors.</p><p>Bucky's hand smashes the mug he was holding. He walks up to the man and tells him to say it again. He goes on about how Cap turned on his own people and dishonored his uniform. Bucky loses it and begins fighting everyone in the bar. When everyone is lying on the ground, he thinks how Cap would be ashamed of his actions. Realizing this makes him miss Steve even more. Falcon arrives. He tells Bucky he needs to get out of there before the police arrive. Bucky insists on paying his tab first. As he walks out, he knows what he has to do next. He has to kill Tony Stark!</p>",

Suddenly he finds himself standing before Lady Deathstrike and her deadly soldiers.</p><p>Elsewhere, the mutant, Peepers, phones X-Factor. He says he thinks he is being followed and needs some help. Siryn asks where he is and they will send help. Peeper is driving down the highway when a deer is thrown at his windshield. Peepers' car crashes off the road into the woods. Barely conscious, he soon finds himself peeping the jaws of Predator X.</p><p>In Brooklyn, 80 years in the future, the Madrox dupe and Layla set up a plan to ambush a couple soldiers outside the mutant relocation camp. Cautious that it might be a trap, the two soldiers do a scan on Layla's body as she lies on the ground. At first the readings say she is \"clean.\" As they go to check on her, her powers suddenly kick in. In their surprise, she tells them that it comes and goes. Jamie's dupe creates more dupes to take them out. Trying to question one, they do not get much cooperation.</p><p>In Cooperstown, Wolverine, X-23, Wolfsbane, Warpath, Hepzibah, and Caliban sneak into the hospital where the mutant baby was born. Now that the smoke has cleared, they should be able to to track Cable, who is currently fighting Lady Deathstrike.</p><p>In the future, Jamie and Layla are told that it was mutant that brought about the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56868\" href=\"/mutant-containment-center-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/4020-56868/\">mutant relocation camp</a>. It was their own fault. They also find out that as soon as they said the word, \"mutants,\" more soldiers were brought in. Jamie is given a power dampener and his dupes are absorbed back into him. Layla doesn't show any signs of being a mutant (again) and they assume she is an innocent human being held hostage. She quickly tells them that she is working with him and is taken into custody along with Jamie.</p><p>Siryn finds the remains of poor Peepers. Xavier contemplates what may happen to Cable because of Scott's decision. A bloody Cable (and baby) are surrounded as he has to figure out how to save themselves.</p><p><i>To be continued in <b>X-Men #45</b></i></p>",
