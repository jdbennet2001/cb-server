            "description": "<p><em>The Heroes for Hire go to Madripoor to investigate the piracy of a stone statue of Mulan!</em></p><p>Upon the South China Sea, a tanker is boarded and taken over by modern-day pirates led by Lionmane. They achieve their goal, the theft of a stone statue of Mulan, a legendary warrior woman of ancient China.</p><p>Later, the captain of the vessel and a the representative of a consortium of insurance companies visit Oracle, Inc. intending to contract the Heroes for Hire to stop the pirates. Iron Fist (Danny Rand) explains that the intelligence they've gathered indicates the Chinese government believes the ruling body of Madripoor is behind the theft and impending auction of the statue. He then introduces his team: Colleen Wing, Shen Kuei a.k.a. the Cat and the master of Kung Fu, Shang-Chi.</p><p>Three days later, the team is in Madripoor, attending the auction of the statue. Colleen expresses to Danny her feelings that the event is a set-up, while Jessica Drew, in the employ of China, shows up as well.</p><p>As the auction is about to start, a team of Chinese soldiers, led by a General Lo Chien, burst in, aiming to retake the statue. A brawl erupts between the soldiers, the auction attendees, the H4H team, Jessica and, emerging from the shadows, Wolverine. With a smirk, the Cat watches from the sidelines. The fracas ends when the statue explodes. Chien orders his troops out, promising revenge, while Wolverine leads the Heroes to his safe house.</p><p>There, after comparing notes, Jessica agrees to join forces with Fist and his team, but Logan (Wolverine), considering the group to be amateurs, tells them all to return home, while he handles the affair.</p><p>Disregarding Logan's 'suggestion', Danny procures a boat, and after having spread word that there are valuables being transported, sets sail with his team on the South China Sea in hopes of ambushing Lionmane and his pirates. Colleen delivers news she's heard on the radio that Chien is leading an invasion force against Madripoor. The heroes then discuss clues they had picked up at the auction that Lo Chien may be Lionmane. They decide to return to port when the boat is hit by an explosion that throws them into shark-infested waters.</p>",
