They realize when the prophecy said Batwoman and Cain were to be sacrificed, that Cain could be spelled anyway. Katherine \"Kate\" Kane was the Batwoman and now she is to be sacrificed. Along the way Renee questions her about herself and tries to figure herself out. Renee would eventually become the new Question as she puts on his mask. Renee finds where they are doing the ritual and is attacked. She was a little late when Batwoman gets stabbed for the ritual by Bruno. Renee distracts him and Batwoman takes out the knife and kills Bruno with it. Batwoman would lay in Renee's arms dying.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The event of the year is here! This brand-new, year-long weekly series features a cast of hundreds where anything goes! With head writer Paul Dini and a rotating team of some of the industry's best writers and artists, COUNTDOWN will serve as the backbone of the DCU in 2007.</p><p>When a character dies in COUNTDOWN 51, it sets off an unexpected ripple that will touch virtually every character in the DC Universe.</p><p>The COUNTDOWN is on…so begins the end!</p><p>In Gotham City, Mary Marvel faces off against an enraged Black Adam. She is shocked to see the dead bodies lying around due to Black Adam killing those who trespassed on his territory. He prepares to engage her but she tells him that she found him by accident. She's not there to judge him but thinks she was sent to him for help. She tells him that she cannot find her brother, Captain Marvel. She says that the two of them are the same since they are powerless. When she mentions his powers, he begins laughing uncontrollably.</p><p>In Metropolis, Jimmy faces the wraith of Perry White. Jimmy has returned from Arkham after seeing the Joker without a story. He tells Perry that when he told the Joker his daughter had been killed, the Joker said he didn't have one. Perry then tells Jimmy he should look into what Jason Todd told him about the killer being an alien. Suddenly, the city is attacked from above. Jimmy is already out the door before Perry can yell at him. As he heads outside, he activates his Superman signal watch. A taxi and another car get into an accident. People stand around to watch. A stray blast from above hits a building and debris is falling towards them. Jimmy tells himself he needs to do something to save them.</p><p>Donna Troy, Robin, Cyborg, and Raven stand at Duela Dent's grave. Even though she did questionable things from time to time, she was still considered a Titan. The others leave and Jason Todd surprises Donna by showing up. He tells them about how she died and what the alien said about her not belonging in their reality. He also mentions how he and she aren't supposed to be there either.</p><p>In the Justice League's satellite headquarters, Karate Kid talks to Starman and wonders how long they're going to keep him locked up. He says he wishes he knew what happened to Starman to make him lose his mind. He also wonders why he wound up on a trident suit with a Starro on his neck. Starman says that's an easy answer, the impossible happened to him, Doctor Impossible.</p><p>As Black Adam finishes his laughing fit, Mary asks what's so funny. He says that the powers have been a curse. Mary argues that they're a gift.</p><p>In Metropolis, Jimmy grabs the people standing and carries them to safety as he moves like lightning. They ask him how he did that and he says he doesn't know. They figure it was an adrenaline rush in a time of emergency. Then there is a another blast as a figure lands in the street creating a crater. Jimmy sees Lightray lying there. Superman arrives and is surprised to see Lightray in that condition. Jimmy asks if he's dying and Superman says he doens't know what that means when dealing with a New God. Superman heads up to see if there is anything else out there. Jimmy goes into the crater to try to talk to Lightray. Lightray grabs Jimmy's hand and mumbles \"...Infinite...\" There is a bright flash of light and Jimmy screams out. Superman barely sees someone in the distance. He pushes himself to go after them but they escape in a Boom tube. Returning to Metropolis, he sees the bright light with Jimmy in the center. Jimmy tells him he's okay but Lightray seems to be dead, even though that doesn't seem possible.</p><p><em>Back up story</em></p><p><b>History of the Mutliverse, Chapter Two</b></p><p>More on the Monitors' mission to safeguard the multiverse.</p>",
