It's a time before Emergence  Day and the  arrival of the Locusts, and the humans of Sera have  battling each other for 62  years in conflict known as the Pendulum  Wars. Adam is appalled by the human  carnage he sees in battle and is  determined to find a better way to wage war.  He's been offered a post  in the COG's weapons research agency, but has to  wrestle with the guilt  of abandoning his brothers in arms for what some might  view as an easy  way out. Adam's decision will ultimately have long-term  ramifications  even after the coming of E-Day.  </i>",
