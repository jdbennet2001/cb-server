            "description": "<p><i>It's all-out war as the Challengers find Ray Palmer - and so does everyone else! The fate of a universe hangs in the balance, as heroes and villains from across the multiverse face betrayal and death with Earth as their battlefield!</i></p> <p><b><i>Spoilers!</i></b></p> <p>Mary Marvel and Eclipso/Jean Loring continue their fight in space. They conveniently make their way to Earth. Eclipso is ready to unleash her full power against Mary. She is about to kill her in order to get her magic. Mary turns the tables on her. Having held the Eclipso jewel recently, Mary is aware what Eclipso/Jean has done to Sue Dibny. Mary says she has to pay for that. Mary has seen that Jean was bad before. It's not just the jewel that is driving her. There's a reason Eclipso sought Jean out for its host. Mary sees that she was almost like Jean. Hungering for power. She doesn't want to be that person. Eclipso then pleads for Mary to giver her the power rather than simply waste it. Mary is willing. The power hasn't brought her anything but pain and misery. Embracing Eclipso, Mary says \"Shazam!\" Both are knocked out by the blast and fall to the water below.</p> <p>On Earth 51, Ray Palmer stands before the Monitor as he says it is time for him to die. Barry Allen rushes to protect his friend, only to get fried by the Monitor. Kyle tries to stop him but the Monitor points out that his ring isn't enough to stand against him. Donna has no choice but to attack also. During all of this, Ray leads the Jean of this world downstairs away from the fight. She is confused over what is happening and what has happened to Barry. Ray tells her they need to leave this reality. Still confused, Ray tries to comfort her by promising that he won't allow things to fall apart again. He has a portal open but \"Bob\" smashes through the ceiling. Ray tries getting Jean to go with him but she is still too confused and pulls away. As the Monitor attempts to wipe Ray Palmer out, he shrinks. Jean is too far away and seems to have been hit by the blast. Ray looks up to see the burnt remains of his wife fall to the floor. He falls to his knees in tears.<br /></p> <p>As the Monitor tries to reassure Ray that he will soon be joining his wife, Ralph Dibny jumps on his back to stop him. He too is destroyed. Kyle grabs Ray and flies away. Donna stands before the Monitor as Jason throws a dagger in the back of his head. Donna uses the momentary distraction to fly them both away.<br /></p> <p>The Monitor isn't quick to follow knowing that they do not have the technology to leave the world. Before he can do anything, he is surrounded by the other Monitors. He is told that they should not have been able to escape. Bob points out that it was their plan to use the anomalies to find the \"key\" Ray Palmer. Solomon tells Bob it is time to go home as they should be one. The other Monitors are shocked that Solomon drained him. They were also unaware of their plana. Solomon is surprised that Bob wasn't absorbed into him. He says everything that he was should now be inside him. He tells the others that they have waited too long. The Source has eluded them. Their conversation is soon interrupted by the Monarch and his army.</p> <p>Mary Marvel wakes up on the shore of a beach, alone. She is relieved that she can no longer feel the dark power inside her. Not knowing where she is, she looks up to see a couple of Amazons of Themyscira and a hellhound towering over her. They tell her she is trespassing and do not look too happy.</p> <p><i>Back up story</i>: <b>The Origin of Monarch</b> <i>by Scott Beatty and Scott Kolins.</i></p>",

But to take down this ancient threat, Wonder Woman must find a way to return to Paradise Island, from which she was banned! Meanwhile, Nemesis is left alone to face the rampaging army of Captain Nazi!</p><p><strong><em>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead</em></strong></p><p>The four guards personally chosen by Hippolyta plan their attack on her and sneak up to the room where she sleeps. They notice an eagle in the air and Aklyone says that Philomela said it was an ill omen. As they make their way to Hippolyta's bedroom, Phillipus stops them, suspicious that the four of them are sneaking up to Hippolyta's bedroom in the middle of the night. Alkyone asks her to join her, to rid of the \"infection\". Phillipus refuses and Philomela shoots her down with arrows. Alkyone raises her sword to kill the baby, though the eagle in the air squawks and wakes Hippolyta up, where the Amazon traitors fight with the other Amazons.</p><p><em>Present Day</em></p><p>Some soldiers patrol their routes when they come across Wonder Woman, with her arms crossed and ready to fight. She throws a punch and knocks out the rest. She grabs one by the neck, and he begs for her forgiveness. She forgives him in the name of honour and orders him to gather his wounded, his forces and surrender his weapons. She orders them to leave and tells them their rendezvous point where they will be arrested. Meanwhile, the traitorous Amazons are watching from afar and observe her fighting skills, comparing her to Hippolyta. Philomela then fires her arrows, piercing Wonder Woman. Alkyone tells her that they have taken her mother, and brought a challenge upon Wonder Woman, where she has to go past four obstacles. She initiates the challenge, where she's shot by arrows, speared by a trident and hit by a club.</p><p>Wonder Woman realises that she will have to play <em>their</em> way if she will ever defeat them. She sneaks up on Charis, roping her up to the tree branch, leaving her hanging. She disarms Myrto and her trident, and grabs it, throwing it to Philomela and breaks her bow. Charis breaks the branch with her club, and all three charge for, but she defeats them all, now that she has learned their ways of fighting. She finally makes her way to Alkyone and Hippolyta. Alkyone bows down to Diana and asks her to end this. Diana forgives her, but Alkyone says, \"You could have been mine\" and makes a cut across Diana's stomach. She runs for the cliff and dives down into the water. Diana assigns the superhuman gorillas the mission of protecting Hippolyta while she has a birthday in America. Etta Candy hugs Diana, while Plastic Man offers her cake.</p><p>Etta and Diana go up on the rooftop, and Diana asks about her birth, and wonders if there is more to it. Does Diana want to know more? Etta reminds Diana that if she searches, she will find and ponders the line, \"Daughter of a Hunter's Moon\" as Diana looks up to the perfect circle of a moon.</p>",

Kaplan gives them good news. He's willing to perform a small surgical procedure which should cure Benjy's hearing problem. This overjoys May since she feels responsible for Carnage taking over Benjy. Kaplan wants to take blood samples from the entire family to prepare for the \"unexpected\" and have a potential donor in place.</p><p>At Valentine Motors, the place is attacked by someone throwing smoke bombs. Mr. Valentine, also known as Handsome Richie, tries to make an escape in a hidden door but is shocked to find a figure standing on the other side. The man tells him that the hidden door is among the information he recently came into possession of. He tells him that he is planning on putting the information up for auction.</p><p>A little later, Valentine visits the office Chesbro, who is using smoke machines and is surrounded by hired muscle. He tells him the man called himself Crimelord and claimed to have Wilson Fisk's old files. Chesbro is surprised because he thought the police had possession of it. Valentine asks if someone declared a gang war and didn't tell him. Chesbro just says that there's a lot of people that want to replace Black Tarantula. He tells Valentine to find out the location of the auction and get back to him right away. He says he has the perfect person in mind to go after him.</p><p>The next day Dr. Kaplan calls the Parkers and says he has an O.R. room booked and wants Benjy to go in that day. Peter and MJ are allowed to spend the night in the hospital with Benjy but tell May she should go home and rest since she will most likely be the best match for being a donor.</p><p>Hobgoblin meets with Detective Drasco and yells at him about the Kingpin's disc. He wants to know how Crimelord got a hold of it. Drasco says he's looking into it and leaves. Mindworm steps in and Hobgoblin asks if he got read any information off of his mind. Mindworm says it's hard to read cops plus the fact that he's playing both sides. He then prepares to go out and gather some more information under the guise of one of Tarantula's underbosses.</p><p>At school, May is walking with Davida and runs into Gene. He asks to speak to her alone and wonders if she's thought about what he said about getting back together. He wants to know if she's willing to make some changes so that they can have a chance.</p><p>Chesbro hears from Cottonmouth about the time and location of the auction. Mindworm is with him as he makes the call. Chesbro then calls Spider-Girl and fills her in on the disc and the dangers of it falling into the wrong hands. She wasn't planning on going out tonight but now feels she doesn't have a choice. She decides to call and arrange a meet with Drasco since he owes her.</p><p>At a bar, Charlie Kurkle, the man that originally got a hold of the disc is offered a job by a friend. He tells him that he has his own thing going on and it could set him up for life.</p><p>Spider-Girl meets with Drasco and tells him she's disappointed in him. He asks her if she thinks he'd really dress up in a mask and call himself \"Crimelord.\" Spider-Girl agrees it doesn't seem like something he'd do. He suggests that perhaps he got them from Kurkle. He's been keeping an eye on him. When Drasco has his back turned, Spider-Girl slips a spider-tracer on his back. Drasco sees Kurkle leaving the bar and moves to follow him. Spider-Girl does too from above. At a seedy hotel, she finds him talking with his ex-girlfriend, Mona.</p><p>Spider-Girl returns home to get some rest. Her parents and Benjy leave for the hospital. As soon as they leave, there's a knock at the door. Fearing it could be Deadspot, she opens it to find Davida and Courtney. They've come with pizza and movies.</p><p>Deadspot gets a phone call. She says she's still working on completing her job. The caller tells her he(?) may have another job for her.</p><p>Courtney and Davida leave at midnight. May knows she should sleep but is too wound up. She decides to go out swinging for a bit. She figures Drasco must be at home in bed and wants to see where he lives. Instead of his home, she is lead to an old theater in Brooklyn. Seeing who is entering, she figures it must be Crimelord's auction. There's an explosion that catches her off guard. The Hobgoblin is there.</p><p>Inside, the Deadly Delilah, ruler of the upper East side; Cottonmouth, controller of the Bronx; Man-Mountain Marko, West Side; and Fancy Dan all walk in.</p><p>Hobgoblin has some new tricks in his bag. Taking a cue from Spider-Girl's impact webbing, he's developed a new goblin grenade. When one explodes nearby Spider-Girl, it wraps her up in an unbreakable bag.</p><p>Crimelord begins his auction. Hobgoblin enters and bids one Spider-Girl and claims no one would have a higher bid.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>In the age of the Superhuman Registration Act, the only good hero is one that plays by the book -- which the card-carrying Moon Knight most assuredly does not. Indeed, with Moon Knight fast becoming the poster child for recklessness and brutality, the question of the day is just how he got a Registration Card in the first place! As Tony Stark's investigation unearths the ugly truth, Marc Spector braces himself for the consequences, unaware that an equally grave threat is preparing to strike. Carson Knowles -- a.k.a. the Black Spectre -- is back and he wants payback.</p><p>The recent violent activities of \"Moon Knight\" are all over the news. The media is demanding to know why his actions are not being dealt with. Two men have been killed. The PR man from S.H.I.E.L.D. claims it is looking into the matter to see if any laws were broken.</p><p>Frenchie and Rob watch the news debate in silence. Eventually Frenchie has had enough and turns off the television. After he leaves the room, Rob turns it back on. Marlene catches some of the program and decides to give Marc a call.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to talk to the doctor that gave Moon Knight his psychological profile. When the agents arrive at his office, he hangs himself before they enter. Stark isn't thrilled by this.</p><p>A weapons dealer shows off some product to Carson Knowles. He has some new weapons for him and armor. When the dealer checks the bag that should contain the money, he finds it empty. Looking up, Carson delivers a fatal blow with a sword.</p><p>Marc and Marlene talk at a diner. He's surprised she called him. She just couldn't stay away. She asks him about the parole officer he's accused of killing. Marc asks her if she believes that. She says it'd easier to trust him if she didn't walk in on him wearing a dead man's face. After they joke a bit, she tells him that she ran into Carson Knowles. Marc asks when. Marlene tells him it was a couple days ago and this sets Marc off. He says she should've told him earlier. Marlene tells him it seems that he has changed. Marc now figures that Carson must be the one killing people and putting the blame on Moon Knight. Their dinner is over. Later he comes home and finds his butler and housekeeper watching the news in horror. He smashes the tv and tells them to get out.</p><p>At the weapons dealer's place, a couple of detective investigate the scene. The guy has a crescent carved into his forehead but the lead detective questions the use of a sword. The other figures it came from one of the many swords in the room. They are interrupted by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they take over the investigation. The detective tries mentioning that it could be a copy cat but he is quickly shut down.</p><p>Moon Knight prepares to go out in the copter. Ray tries talking to him about the other night when he had to use the guns. Ray soon tells him that the guys deserved to die. Marc is outraged by this. Ray says that maybe they need some new younger blood in this operation. Their argument is violently interrupted as the wall explodes open. They are soon surrounded by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Iron Man tells Moon Knight they have things to discuss...</p>",
