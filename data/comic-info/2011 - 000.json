The mysteries surrounding private investigator LADY MECHANIKA and her origin begin to unfold as she heads to a rundown city known as Satan's Alley. Located on the lower eastside, it is an area of town under siege by the presence of a murderous creature of unknown origin. While a weapons manufacturer has issued a reward for the unknown slayer, drawing a crowd of bounty hunters looking to cash in, Lady Mechanika's purpose is far more personal - information that could lead to the truth about her creation. Featuring a 13-page story that sets the stage for the brand-new LADY MECHANIKA #1 issue coming next month, make sure to get in on the ground floor of the next exciting series!

The most popular femme fatale in comics returns with a vicious new tale that delivers for both new and old readers! Lady Death is no more, stripped of her supernatural abilities, memories and soul, banished from the Nether Realm and left for dead, utterly defeated and powerless. In her place, Hope's greatest foe has stolen her kingdom, her legacy and even her face, transforming the Realm into a nightmare world and rules it with an unparalleled, sadistic pleasure. But this is only the beginning! The most sprawling epic in Lady Death's history begins as Illadra, a simple thief in Medieval Spain, learns that her unnatural skills are tied to another life she has glimpsed in her darkest nightmares, one where she is Lady Death. Her world is about to be turned upside down when a demonic emissary and a battalion of zombie warriors thrusts her down a bloody path of self-discovery, and a quest to recover the true self that was ripped from her by the villainous Death Queen!</i></p>",
