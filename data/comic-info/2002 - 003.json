            "description": "<p><em>Trapped inside an impenetrable bunker, Yorick Brown struggles to rescue his Congresswoman mother from a murderous posse. Meanwhile, Culper Ring operative Agent 355 risks her life to protect the first female President of the U.S., and the news that a lone male has survived begins to leak out...</em></p><p>Agent 355 is on the road with the new President. In washington, the wives of the dead Republican Congressmen are laying siege to the whitehouse to forcably take thier husbands seats. The Israelis find out about Yorricks existance.</p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>Miles outside Washington D.C., Agent 355 and new President of the United States Margaret Valentine begin walking due to the unresolved traffic snarl that occurred when the men died.</p><p>At the White House, Representative Brown looks out the window and sees some of the wives of dead Congressmen. She explains to Yorick that the women want their husbands' seats and plan on holding the White House hostage. She leads him down to a fallout shelter and locks him in. Senator Cavanaugh finds Representative Brown and the two head out to start a dialogue with the angry women. Yorick immediately begins devising a way out of the bunker.</p><p>Outside, Representative Brown approaches the women and sees that they have taken a guard hostage. The women demand their husbands' seats and Rep. Brown denies them since they still live in a democracy. Ms. Stahl makes her case but is cut short when the woman holding the guard prisoner slips and shoots the guard in the head. Another guard reacts and kills the woman. This sets Ms. Stahl off and she shoots back at the guard. The fight ends when Agent 355 rolls up with the new president in a garbage truck. A political discussion ensues but gets interrupted when Yorick appears. (He had used a fire to override the bunker's locks.)</p><p>President Valentine takes Yorick and his mother, as well as Agent 355, into the Oval Office and decides that Yorick cannot stay in one place, as it would be too risky. She okays the move to have him find Dr. Mann and sends Agent 355 with him just in case he tries to head off to Australia to find Beth.</p><p>In Israel, Tse'Elon (new Chief of the General Staff) receives a phone call from the United States. A person on the other end reveals that a man named Yorick Brown lives.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Keitaro and Naru come home from the day's exam. They are both sure they passed so the gang throws them a party. Later they go for a walk and discuss Tokyo University.</p><p>The next day, Keitaro finally tells Naru that she is the girl he made his promise to go to Tokyo U with. Naru tells him that he is mistaken. The promise she made was two years ago with a certain someone. Keitaro is crestfallen as they go to take their final exam.</p><p>It's the day of the exam results get announced. Keitaro has still not gotten over the fact that Naru is not his promise girl. They go to the university to see their results. Keitaro, as he expected, has failed. He goes to congratulate Naru who, unbelievably, has also failed. They go to a restaurant and end up getting drunk to ease their pain. They end up getting into an argument, and Naru tells Keitaro she never wants to see him again. Keitaro decides he needs to get away for awhile.</p><p>Keitaro is on his way to Kyoto to clear his mind. As he left without telling anyone where he was going, he decides to call Hinata House and let them know he's okay. At the phone, he realized he doesn't have any change. A lady in the next booth hands him a phone card, and he calls the dorm. Shinobu answers the phone and Keitaro tries to tell her what's going on, but the phone card runs out of money before he can finish. Shinobu and the gang leap to the conclusion that Keitaro and Naru have eloped.</p><p>Back on the train, Keitaro bumps into the mysterious lady who had given him the phone card. The lady puts her glasses on and...it's Naru! Naru storms off, believing Keitaro had followed her on HER emotion-cleansing journey. Later, it is revealed that unbeknownst to each other, Keitaro and Naru are staying at the same hotel.</p><p>At Hinata House, Su and Shinobu leave a note for the others and head out on their own to find Keitaro and Naru.</p><p>In Kyoto meanwhile, Keitaro and Naru keep encountering each other at various tourist destinations. They run into each other again at the hotel bath. They discover they keep meeting because they're both following the same tourist brochure from the Hinata House lobby. They calm down and apologize to each other, when a bunch of people walk in to take advantage of the mixed baths. Unfortunately, it's mostly old men. Keitaro and Naru manage to embarrass themselves again and rush off.</p><p>On the way to their rooms, the owner of the inn stops them tells them that the inn is overbooked. Since Keitaro and Naru both came from the same address; she has put them both in the same room for the night.</p><p>While Keitaro and Naru are forced to sleep in the same room together; Motoko and Kitsune find the note Su left and head out in search of her and Shinobu. Keitaro and Naru play ping-pong until they both decide to go to sleep. Naru puts a divider between the futons and tells Keitaro that if he crosses it, she will kill him. When Naru wakes up in the morning, she finds that Keitaro had tied himself up in his futon to keep from doing anything perverted. Naru is impressed.</p><p>Keitaro and Naru are on a ferry to their next destination. Keitaro accidentally bumps into a woman and knocks her down. They're afraid that they've killed her, until she regains consciousness and introduces herself. Her name is Mutsumi Otohime. She's anemic and prone to fainting spells. She is also very, VERY clumsy.</p><p>Later, Keitaro and Naru are having dinner and briefly discuss the guy Naru had made her promise with. Musumi shows up, accidentally dropping a bunch of squid on them. Keitaro notices that Mutsumi has a copy of her last will and testament in her pocket.</p><p>Later still, Keitaro and Naru are walking about the ship when they see Mutsumi about to fall overboard. Convinced that she is about to commit suicide, they come to her rescue. Mutsumi explains that she wasn't trying to kill herself, she just carries a copy of her will with her at all times because she's so weak she never knows when she just might keel over. Mutsumi also reveals that she decided to go on a journey of healing after failing her college entrance exam.</p><p>As they depart the ferry, Keitaro and Naru are discussing how similar Mutsumi's situation is to their own. Mutsumi shows up and asks if she can travel with them.</p><p>Keitaro, Naru and Mutsumi are having dinner in Kagoshima. Keitaro and Mustumi are both three-year ronins(students who failed to get into college three years in a row). Naru marvels at how similar they are to each other. They get a hotel room together, which Naru had to pay for since the other two had lost their wallets.</p><p>At the hotel, Naru begins to feel a little jealous over how much Keitaro and Mutsumi have in common. She goes to take a shower while Mutsumi asks Keitaro how he feels about Naru. In the shower, Naru is trying to overcome her feelings of jeaoulsy when Mutsumi walks in. She's a little drunk and wants to bathe Naru. She tells Naru that Keitaro said that he liked her. She causes Naru to slip and fall and Naru realizes that Mutsumi is exactly like a female clone of Keitaro. Having heard the commotion, Keitaro rushes in and gets pounded by Naru for his troubles.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kitsune is forcing Motoko to perform sword tricks to earn money for their trip.</p><p>Keitaro, Naru, and Mutsumi are stranded in a raft at sea. A flashback reveals that they were on their way to visit Mutsumi's family in Okinawa. They wash up on shore and Naru tries to sort out her feelings toward Keitaro. She catches Mutsumi kissing Keitaro and runs away. Keitaro chases after her and tries to tell Naru that he loves her, but a passing boat interrupts. They find out that the island they've been on is Mutsumi's back yard. As the group says goodbye, Mutsumi gives Keitaro and Naru a box and also gives Naru a kiss. Naru is taken aback, but Mutsumi apologizes says she has a bad habit of kissing people when she likes them a lot. Naru and Keitaro open up the box Mutsumi had given them to reveal... a hot springs turtle.</p><p>Su and Shinobu have finally made it to Kyoto after accidentally traveling all over Japan. They unknowingly walk past Kitsune, who is still cajoling Motoko into performing for money. Back at their hotel, the owner notices some pictures they have and tells them that Keitaro and Naru stayed there a few days ago.</p><p>The next day, Su uses one of her gadgets to read the ferry passenger list and discovers that Keitaro and Naru are in Okinawa. Unfortunately, Su and Shinobu are out of money. Shinobu is forced to sell matches on the street, when some mobsters show up. They want to put Shinobu to work for them, bu Su and Shinobu run away. They ask a lady for help who turns out to be Motoko. She uses a special sword technique to defeat the gangsters.</p><p>Meanwhile, Keitaro and Naru are feeding their turtle and discussing their future plans. Naru tells Keitaro that she knows he likes her. They are about to kiss, when BAM! Su shows up and gives Keitaro a kick to the face. The rest of the gang shows up, and they all decide to go back to Hinata House.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 16: Birth of the Tokyo University Couple!</li><li>Chapter 17: Congratulations on Getting Into Tokyo U!</li><li>Chapter 18: A Journey of Sorrow and Youth</li><li>Chapter 19: Heart Flutterings and Mixed Bathings</li><li>Chapter 20: A Virginal Night</li><li>Chapter 21: Oh Me, Oh My, Otohime Appears!!</li><li>Chapter 22: Sorry For Being So Alike ♥</li><li>Chapter 23: Palpitations While Gloating Away!</li><li>Chapter 24: Everyone Get Together!

It was six years ago Masaki Kurosaki was murdered while trying to protect Ichigo. Ichigo has kept the secret of what happened with him since then. When Ichigo wakes up on the the morning of the sixth anniversary he can't believe how long it has been and rushes to get ready for school. At school several people realize that there is a difference in his behavior and Tatsuki makes a note that he will not be at school the next day.</p><p>That evening Ichigo and his family have a meeting to plan the picnic and anniversary of Masaki's death. As Ichigo prepares for bed Rukia begins to bother him about what him and his family have been up to. As she presses him for answers Ichigo erupts and explains that they are going to remember the anniversary of his mother's murder.</p><p>The next day as Ichigo and the rest of his family Rukia is there to greet him and begins asking him if maybe a Hollow killed his mother. Ichigo becomes frustrated and yells at Rukia and insists that she is wrong. As Ichigo prepares to walk away he sees a familiar face and runs off after her. Before he can catch her though Rukia stops him and asks him why he ran off. Suddenly overwhelmed by his emotions Ichigo breaks down and admits that he is responsible for his mother's death.</p><p>Before Ichigo finds his way back to the rest of his family and tries to somewhat enjoy what is left of the day, but unfortunately Ichigo is life's joke. Before he knows what is happening Rukia's Hollow alert goes off telling them trouble is in the area. Back at the grave sites a large Hollow appears before Karin and Yuzu and attacks them. Before the monster can get too settled in for his meal Ichigo shows up and recognizes that the young woman that he remembers is actually standing with the Hollow. As push comes to shove Ichigo learns that the girl is a part of the Hollow that it uses to lure in victims that can detect it's spirit so that it can devour only strong spiritualist. Realizing that the Hollow was the one that killed his mother Ichigo becomes furious and attacks recklessly. During the fight Ichigo gets seriously wounded before he can lure the Hollow in close enough to fight it back. the Hollow proves especially vicious as it uses it's hand to copy Ichigo's memory of his mother and cloaking it's bait in it. Ichigo becomes too hesitant to attack and ends up being injured again. The Hollow foolishly gloats instead that it has won and ends up being severely injured by Ichigo. Before Ichigo can finish it off though the Hollow retreats inside it's bait, which actually serves as a second body in case Grand Fisher becomes mortally wounded. Ichigo tries to follow with his wounds but Rukia stops him when he finally comes to the conclusion that he can't go on. Finally Ichigo awakens in his body, which Kon was using to cover for him, and realizes that he is worse off being too injured for Rukia to completely heal.</p><p>As the story closes Ichigo talks to his father at his mother's grave. Isshin proves to be very glad that his wife would chose to sacrifice herself for their family. Isshin instead tells Ichigo that he expects him to live a long fulfilling life and to die old, with a woman that he loves. As the story closes Ichigo turns to Rukia resolving to make himself a better Soul Reaper.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 17 - 6/17</li><li>Chapter 18 - 6/17 op. 2 Doesn't Smile Much Anymore</li><li>Chapter 19 - 6/17 op. 3 memories in the rain</li><li>Chapter 20 - 6/17 op. 4 A Face From the Past</li><li>Chapter 21 - 6/17 op. 5 A Fighting Boy</li><li>Chapter 22 - 6/17 op. 6 Battle in the Graveyard</li><li>Chapter 23 - 6/17 op. 7 Sharp Will, Dull Blade</li><li>Chapter 24 - 6/17 op. 8 One-Sidd Sympathy</li><li>Chapter 25 - 6/17 op. 9 A Fighting Boy 2 (The Cigarette Blues Mix)</li></ul>",

Desperate Earth commandos prepare to take out the alien ambassador, but not before he uses his giant robot to exact reprisal for Hoichi's actions. Little does he know that there's a bigger enemy waiting in Japan than a kid in a black gun-suit.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Debuting in 1999, Get Fuzzy has rocketed to the top of the charts. Get Fuzzy has become a hit cartoon with its bitingly funny portrait of single life with pets. And why not? The laughs come fast and furious. Get Fuzzy features Rob Wilco, a single, mild-mannered advertising executive who's the so-called guardian of Bucky and Satchel, anthropomorphic scamps that still live by their animal instincts. Bucky, a temperamental cat who carries a boom box and goes on spending sprees, definitely calls the shots in this eclectic household, while Satchel is a kindly canine with a sensitive soul who tries to remain neutral, even though he bears the brunt of his feline companion's mischief. Between the three of them, the Wilco household faces a whole host of trials and tribulations that classify them as family. Satchel wants his boundaries respected. Bucky refuses to eat vegetables but insists on snarfing up Rob's plants. Rob tries to meet women, but his pets continually subvert his efforts. In every frame, Get Fuzzy depicts the hilarious war between the species, giving the animals an equal footing in hilarious one-upmanship. Get Fuzzy is the comic strip for everyone who loves their pets with an attitude. That said, Groovitude is Get Fuzzy at its finest.</i></p>",

            "description": "<div class=\"display-view\"><p>Six years ago Ichigo and his family had the center of their universe tore out of their lives. It was six years ago Masaki Kurosaki was murdered while trying to protect Ichigo. Ichigo has kept the secret of what happened with him since then. When Ichigo wakes up on the the morning of the sixth anniversary he can't believe how long it has been and rushes to get ready for school. At school several people realize that there is a difference in his behavior and Tatsuki makes a note that he will not be at school the next day.</p><p>That evening Ichigo and his family have a meeting to plan the picnic and anniversary of Masaki's death. As Ichigo prepares for bed Rukia begins to bother him about what him and his family have been up to. As she presses him for answers Ichigo erupts and explains that they are going to remember the anniversary of his mother's murder.</p><p>The next day as Ichigo and the rest of his family Rukia is there to greet him and begins asking him if maybe a Hollow killed his mother. Ichigo becomes frustrated and yells at Rukia and insists that she is wrong. As Ichigo prepares to walk away he sees a familiar face and runs off after her. Before he can catch her though Rukia stops him and asks him why he ran off. Suddenly overwhelmed by his emotions Ichigo breaks down and admits that he is responsible for his mother's death.</p><p>Before Ichigo finds his way back to the rest of his family and tries to somewhat enjoy what is left of the day, but unfortunately Ichigo is life's joke. Before he knows what is happening Rukia's Hollow alert goes off telling them trouble is in the area. Back at the grave sites a large Hollow appears before Karin and Yuzu and attacks them. Before the monster can get too settled in for his meal Ichigo shows up and recognizes that the young woman that he remembers is actually standing with the Hollow. As push comes to shove Ichigo learns that the girl is a part of the Hollow that it uses to lure in victims that can detect it's spirit so that it can devour only strong spiritualist. Realizing that the Hollow was the one that killed his mother Ichigo becomes furious and attacks recklessly. During the fight Ichigo gets seriously wounded before he can lure the Hollow in close enough to fight it back. the Hollow proves especially vicious as it uses it's hand to copy Ichigo's memory of his mother and cloaking it's bait in it. Ichigo becomes too hesitant to attack and ends up being injured again. The Hollow foolishly gloats instead that it has won and ends up being severely injured by Ichigo. Before Ichigo can finish it off though the Hollow retreats inside it's bait, which actually serves as a second body in case Grand Fisher becomes mortally wounded. Ichigo tries to follow with his wounds but Rukia stops him when he finally comes to the conclusion that he can't go on. Finally Ichigo awakens in his body, which Kon was using to cover for him, and realizes that he is worse off being too injured for Rukia to completely heal.</p><p>As the story closes Ichigo talks to his father at his mother's grave. Isshin proves to be very glad that his wife would chose to sacrifice herself for their family. Isshin instead tells Ichigo that he expects him to live a long fulfilling life and to die old, with a woman that he loves. As the story closes Ichigo turns to Rukia resolving to make himself a better Soul Reaper.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 17 - 6/17</li><li>Chapter 18 - 6/17 op. 2 Doesn't Smile Much Anymore</li><li>Chapter 19 - 6/17 op. 3 memories in the rain</li><li>Chapter 20 - 6/17 op. 4 A Face From the Past</li><li>Chapter 21 - 6/17 op. 5 A Fighting Boy</li><li>Chapter 22 - 6/17 op. 6 Battle in the Graveyard</li><li>Chapter 23 - 6/17 op. 7 Sharp Will, Dull Blade</li><li>Chapter 24 - 6/17 op. 8 One-Sidd Sympathy</li><li>Chapter 25 - 6/17 op. 9 A Fighting Boy 2 (The Cigarette Blues Mix)</li></ul></div>",
