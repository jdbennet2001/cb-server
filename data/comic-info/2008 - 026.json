And as civilians fall, Supergirl makes a vow so impossible and startling, even Superman doubts she can keep her word!</p><p><b>Spoilers</b></p><p>Superman finds Supergirl in a giant crater in Death Valley after her fight with Reactron.  He tells her that next time she should just \"beat up the bad guy.\"  She agrees but can't help wonder how Reactron's powers are even possible.  She doesn't understand how he can even have a normal mind.  Superman tells her that it's their job to bring in the bad guys.  People like S.T.A.R. Labs handle the studying part.  She wonders if they'd even know how to handle him or what questions to ask.  Superman interrupts her as he sees that a couple buildings in Metropolis are in trouble.  Reactron is causing problems.  Superman tells her to get the people out safely and he'll deal with Reactron.</p><p>When Kara tries helping the people, some are put off that they didn't rate high enough to be saved by Superman.  She then finds a frightened little boy hiding under a desk.  When he sees her, he said he knew she'd come for him.  He tells her his name is Thomas and she tells him he's not going to die.</p><p>A stray blast from Reactron hits the buildings and they won't be standing for long.  She has a hundred and twenty-seven people to save.  Moving fast and not being able to be gentle, she takes some out but causes some injuries.  Superman then comes and tells her <i>he'll</i> get the people and she can take on Reactron.  As he streaks off, she says she's sorry.</p><p>Reactron is surprised that Superman \"ran away\" from him.  Supergirl arrives and punches him in the face. He actually feels it but starts laughing as she keeps punching him.  When she asks why he's laughing he says it's because his consciousness is floating in space a million light-years from there.  She wants to know what he is and what he wants.  Reactron says money.  This blows Supergirl away.  He has all this power and just wants to rob a bank.<br/></p><p>As Reactron generates another \"crazy star-bomb thing\" Supergirl grabs it and shoves it in his head.  Then she grabs the power sphere floating above his chest.  Reactron is powered down and unconscious.<br/></p><p>The people thank Superman and she notices Thomas in the hospital.  He's not surprised to see here.  His parents aren't too happy with her.  It turns out Thomas has brain cancer and the doctors told him he only has weeks to live.  Since Supergirl said she wasn't going to let him die, he thinks he has a new lease on life.  Superman begins to talk to Thomas to try to set things straight.  Supergirl insists that she should do the talking.  Thomas tells her that she said he wasn't going to die.  Supergirl then says she meant every word.  She won't let him die.</p>",

His plans for the super hero Initiative have hit a tragic snag. His former flame, believed dead, is being manipulated by one of his deadliest enemies. Even to his strongest allies, Stark appears to be descending into a mental breakdown while everything around him swirls out of control. Now, with the lives of millions hanging in the balance, Iron Man must fight his way out of the darkness and prevent the Mandarin from releasing a plague that would change humanity as we know it!</em></p><p>Dugan convinces Maria Hill to follow Stark's orders, and she instructs the pilots to take the Helicarrier to Nebraska. As Gentech is evacuated, Iron Man and Mandarin begin their fight. En route to Nebraska aboard the Helicarrier, the Gaffer briefs Hill and Alpha Team on the EVH-Beta prototype, which will create a nuclear blast before collapsing into a micro black hole to remove leftover radiation. Finding his old armor badly outmatched, Iron Man distracts the Mandarin with his sonic emitter, then douses him with liquid nitrogen. The Mandarin subdues Iron Man with his black light ring, releases the Extremis test subjects and teleports away with Maya. Battling the Extremis subjects, Stark reveives a call from Hill to say she is nearly in position, and he orders Gentech destroyed. As Gentech explodes, Iron Man attempts to rocket away, but everything around him is drawn into the micro black hole. Afterwards, Gaffer can't find any sign of Iron Man within the event perimeter.</p>",

Finally, Jen will re-learn what it means to be a hero – at a terrible cost.</p><p><strong><em>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead</em></strong></p><p>Continuing from last issue, Kodor and She-Hulk continue fighting, when She-Hulk comes to a realisation that Cazon is in fact a murderer that has been charged as guilty. Kodor then points to Jazinda lying on the floor, dead. She-Hulk holds Jazinda, while Kodor has a molecular stimulator  and uses it to temporarily resurrect the wife that was shot dead. Kodor explains to the lady that her molecules have been energised, which is why she is now alive. However, the molecules soon lose cohesion which means she will go back to her original dead state. Kodor tells her to focus and tell him to explain all she saw of Cazon. The lady however is in too much of a frenzy to calm down and Kodor holds a gun to her, ready to kill her yet again because he was no use to her. She-Hulk comes just in time to push the gun upwards just as it fires, and lectures him on having no compassion. Kodor replies, scolding She-Hulk for the so called compassion that had gotten her friend killed. She-Hulk says that she has a name, and She-Hulk hears a voice. She turns around, and it's Jazinda who is actually still alive. She explains that she was in a regenerative coma.</p><p>Cazon meanwhile is holding the husband from last issue hostage and shoots him in the shoulder thanks to his aggressive manner. Cazon muses on how he will escape, and then lifts the hostage up and flies Kodor's own ship.</p><p>Just then the wife screams \"Larry!\" with Kodor's ship flying above them and the husband tied to the front of the ship. Kodor in anger contemplates shooting down the ship, even if it means killing the husband, but She-Hulk thinks otherwise. She tells him to throw her up. As she flies towards the air, she grabs hold on the side of the ship and Cazon turns the ship round and round hoping to shake She-Hulk off. Cazon then flies up in space, and she loses her grip. She grabs onto the back of the engines, where hot air is causing her great pain. She then pulls something from the engine and the ship breaks down, flying down towards the lake. She-Hulk makes her way towards the front of the ship and frees the man and make their way towards the shore. Cazon also makes his way towards the shore, and then gets a gun pointed towards Kodor. The woman runs in with a gun and wants revenge for killing her, though She-Hulk stops her and says that it can't be the last thing she ever does. With that, she runs to her husband and disappears, thanks to the side-effect from her molecules getting energised from before. Kodor awes at the amazement of She-Hulk not letting the lady kill Cazon, and he replies that she can't, because she's a \"hero\". Meanwhile, Jazinda behind agrees... however, she then says that she's not a hero and stabs his body with her hands. Cazon falls to the ground, dead, with She-Hulk looking down at Cazon.</p>",

On the ship, Pulsipher holds the Muur Talisman in his hand. Two other Mandalorians watch on, wondering if he is mad with power. Pulsipher wonders what kind of secret information the Talisman holds; perhaps the Jedi financial records? In the vent, next to Pulsipher, Gryph perks up when \"financial\" is said. Celeste holds a hand to his mouth. Pulsipher rants on about the power of the Jedi and how something must create that power for them. Celeste, inside the vent, uses her Force powers to move it and for some reason electrocutes him and then electrocuting another Mandalorian in the process.</p><p>Celeste takes off, and follows Pulsipher secretly, with Zayne and Gryph behind. A Mandalorian grabs them, however, and tells them to make their way to the war forge to grab their armour, ready for another take over on Alderaan. Zayne, upon hearing this is speechless and tells Celeste that they're attacking Alderaan. Gryph then interrupts with Mandalorian armour he was offered from the war forge. Gryph pretends that Zayne and Celeste are his prisoners and accidently fires his rifle, causing an explosion. Celeste asks where the lightsaber is, causing a nearby Mandalorian to hear her. Just then, the Mandalorian falls to the floor and transforms into a rakghoul. Celeste takes the opportunity to pull the lightsaber to her, killing the rakghouls. A rakghoul, then sees another Mandalorian and attacks him, turning him into a rakghoul too. Zayne then blocks blaster fire with his lightsaber, to find that a rakghoul had been firing the gun. Confused, Celeste wonders why these rakghouls can use weapons and wonders why they are transforming so quickly. They realise that it's time for them to exit, when they run across a staging area, with soldiers from all over the outer rim; they're going to invade Alderaan, and with the new type of rakghoul disease, they're going to infect everyone!</p>",

Now the</i> <i>X-Men</i> <i>are back to business -- with a new look, a new base of operations, and a mystery to solve that will take them into previously uncharted territory and test them to their core. It all starts on a spaceship hovering 300 hundred feet above the twisted wreckage of Chaparanga Beach. Its sole inhabitant: the mysterious</i> <i>Subject X</i><i>. Five minutes -- just five minutes is all he needs, all he’s asking for.</i></p><p><i>Can the</i> <i>X-Men</i> <i>afford to give it to him?</i></p><p><b><i>Synopsis:</i></b>The X-Men – Cyclops, Emma Frost, Storm, Armor, and Wolverine – touch down on Chaparanga Beach, a junkyard for abandoned spaceships. They are hunting Subject X, who murdered a mysterious artificial mutant in San Francisco.</p><p>Emma quickly zeroes in on their quarry, holed up in one of the few ships still aloft. Armor launches Wolverine at the ship with a Fastball Special to scout ahead while Storm lifts the rest of the team into the air.</p><p>Wolverine crawls through the bowels of the ship, discovering Subject X tinkering with a box connected to the ship's power supply. Subject X lights Wolverine aflame with a single touch and goes back to his box to power it on. When Wolverine recovers and presses his attack Subject X incinerates the air around them!</p><p>Storms arrives with the rest of the team in tow and repels the flames, but they're too late to stop Subject X from bringing his box online. When mysterious figures manifest around the now-glowing box, Cyclops orders the team to abandon ship and Storm to strike it once they're clear.</p><p>Storm's lightning bolt spits the space ship in two. It crashes to the ground in an impressive plume of flames, scattering the salvage workers on the beach below.</p><p>As the team makes their way into the charred hull of the ship, Ororo worries she might have killed Subject X. Scott cuts her off, insisting the ends of preserving the mutant race justify any means necessary.</p><p>Their argument is interrupted when they discover the prone-but-conscious form of Subject X. He insists, “you can't stop the Annex,” and then immolates.</p>",
