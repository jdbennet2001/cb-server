Suddenly he is struck by lightning.  Feeling stronger, he knows that Osiris' powers have returned to him.  Rushing to find him, they discover the gruesome remains of his body.  Not understanding why he would have reverted back to human, Sobek is on scene to inform them that Osiris blamed himself for Kahndaq's recent misery.  He also admits that he feasted on him in order to satiate his hunger.  Sobek reveals that he was not left behind at Dr. Sivana's lab but rather was sent there.  Because Black Adam refused to allow Intergang to pass through his country, they decided to bring Sobek and his siblings to Kahnaq, War, Pestilence, and Death.<br /></p><p>The fight carries on.  As Sobek is about to show Black Adam how he fed on Osiris, Adam rips his jaw apart.  Next he goes after War as Pestilence fights Isis.  Black Adam is taking a beating and Isis begins to feel the affects of Pestilence.  Death is waiting to claim her.  Weak with disease, Isis is about to be taken by Death.  Black Adam defeats War and uses War's gun on Pestilence.  Barely clinging to life, Isis calls forth lava to send Death away from Black Adam.  With her last breath, she says she realizes that his way to keep Kahndaq safe and asks him to avenge them.  With another bolt of lightning striking him, Black Adam is not happy.</p><p>In Nanda Parbat, Renee notices that the flower given to them by Isis withers away.  She knows that Isis must be dead.  It is suggested to her that she go seek out what has happened.  Her clothes has been treated with the same chemical compound that the Question used.  She insists she is not going to be him.  She doesn't want to wear a mask.  She is told that sometimes some questions can only be answered by wearing a mask.  She prepares to head to Kahndaq to see where it leads her.</p>",

Inside, they are reunited with their father, Deathstroke the Terminator. He says their place is with him. A fight soon begins</p><p>Wonder Girl wakes up and finds herself in the Fortress of Solitude. Connor is there. He tells her how ugly she is when she's sleeping. It turns out not to be Connor but rather Match. A fight breaks out between them and things don't look too good for Cassie.</p><p>Kid Devil wakes up to find himself bound to a giant crucifix after his confrontation with Kid Crusader. Kid Crusader wants to perform an exorcism on Kid Devil in order to \"save\" him. Uttering some words, Kid Crusader manages to turn Kid Devil human. He has separated the demon from him but it cannot last for too long. In order to keep them separated, he must kill him.</p><p>Robin is tied up after being taken by surprise by Batgirl. She is under the control of Deathstroke. He's been giving her the same serum that drove Ravager insane. As the fight between Ravager, Jericho, and Deathstroke heats up, Batgirl finds herself face-to-face with Ravager. Now she wants a rematch. As Robin tries to explain to Ravager what's wrong with Batgirl, Deathstroke hits him to shut him up. He wants to see what his daughter is made of. Jericho uses this opportunity to stab him in the back through his chest.</p><p>Raven finds herself bound in front of a bunch of funhouse mirrors courtesy of Enigman and Duela Dent. Cyborg is in pieces by the hands of Risk. Miss Martian is being held captive by Sun Girl and Inertia.</p><p>The fight continues. Robin has become free. He says he's been prepared in case Ravager ever turned on them and started taking the serum again. He figured it might be addictive so he created a serum to counter the affects. Using it on Batgirl, it's becomes clear why she's been leading the League of Assassins, tried framing Robin for her murder, and tried killing Supergirl. With her head finally clear, she vows to kill Deathstroke.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>This year-long weekly series featuring a cast of hundreds kicks into high gear in its second month, under the watchful eye of head writer Paul Dini! See Mary Marvel undergo a surprising transformation! Learn why Donna Troy and Jason Todd are integral players in a cosmic chess game! And see Jimmy Olsen as you've never seen him before!</p><p>Mary arrives at the Rock Of Eternity and sees her newly changed brother. He tells her that now he is everything that Captain Marvel <em>and</em> Shazam were. He says he is the Rock of Eternity and the Rock is him. He mentions that Freddy is undergoing the trials to become the new Shazam (although it seems he should become the new Captain Marvel?). Mary tells him how she's been looking for them and has been powerless after her coma. Billy tells her that there's a big problem which is why he brought her there.</p><p>In Washington, Forerunner is still dealing with the sting of being completely rejected and thrown away by the Monitor. A voice asks if she wonders why the Monitors called her \"Forerunner.\" She responds by attacking, firing numerous needles at the person speaking to her. It turns out to be Monarch, who easily bats the needles away. He tells her that the Monitors fear her and have kept information hidden from her race. They simply used them for centuries. Monarch offers her redemption. He offers to set her on the path so that she can become her own master. She agrees to go with him saying she will kill him if he breaks her word to him.</p><p>In Metropolis, Jimmy Olsen is walking through Suicide Slum. He's looking for trouble in the hopes that he'll be able to get his powers to work. He comes across a street gang and starts a fight with them. One member punches him with no sign of any powers. As Jimmy lies on the ground, he offers his money in the hopes that they will be satisfied with that. As a second member draws nearer, Jimmy's body suddenly shoots out a bunch of needle/spikes that pierce the guy's skin. They flee and the spines retract themselves back into Jimmy. He has no idea what is going on.</p><p>In another part of Metropolis, Holly Robinson is with the women offering her a place to stay. She says she runs a women's shelter. Holly figures she could just check it out and maybe get a meal out of it and then leave. Inside she finds all the women dressed in togas reminiscent to what the Amazons (or ancient Greeks) wore.</p><p>In Keystone City, the Piper and Trickster are on the run from the police. They don't know what they can do now that they \"killed\" the Flash. Piper says that they didn't kill him but Trickster says that doesn't matter. They were with the other Rogues so they are all guilty. When Piper suggests going to the JLA, Trickster says they'd probably get Zatanna to mind-wipe them or worse, hand them over to Batman. They decide they have to stay on the run. As they leave, they are being watched and followed in the hopes of leading them to the others.</p><p>Back at the Rock of Eternity, Billy tells Mary he is concerned with the way she fought the Pharyngula demon. He says she was extremely savage and brutal with the way she took it down. He also mentions that her costume has changed. Mary tells Billy that Adam shared his powers with her. This causes a shocked reaction from Billy. She says she had no other choice. She was alone and powerless. Billy says perhaps it was her destiny to become powerless and lead a normal life. Mary says perhaps it was destiny that she got her powers from Adam. She says she is going to use her powers for good and if Billy doesn't approve then she'll just face her destiny alone.</p><p><em>Back up story</em></p><p><strong>History of the Multiverse, Chapter Six</strong></p>",

But the last generation of mutants isn’t content on the sidelines, launching a sneak attack on the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\" href=\"/purifiers/4060-14915/\"><i>Purifiers</i></a> instead. But have they confronted an enemy that’s out of their league?</p><p>In the Canadian Rockies, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47143\" href=\"/predator-x/4005-47143/\">Predator X</a> comes across and feasts on another (unnamed) mutant.</p><p>At the Xavier Institute, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\" href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\">Surge</a> is fuming over not being involved in the current events. She has just discovered that the Purifiers were involved in the massacre in Alaska and is venting to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\" href=\"/prodigy/4005-40475/\">Prodigy</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\" href=\"/hellion/4005-40454/\">Hellion</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\" href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\">Professor X</a> overhears her rants and tells her that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\">Cyclops</a> had his reasons not to tell them. He then says that he has trained mutants in the past and would like to help train them. Nori goes off on him asking where was he when they were getting killed. She storms off saying that there isn't anything he can teach them. They already know how to die.</p><p>In Dallas, Texas, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\" href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\">Forge</a> tells Scott that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\" href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\">Jamie</a> is still unconscious but his brain functions are working overtime. He asks if perhaps <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\">Emma</a> could come and find out what's going on in Jamie's head. Scott hesitates and says that she is unavailable. Scott seems ready to sacrifice Jamie's life for the possible information they can gather. When Forge calls him on this, Scott simply says that mutants are about to become extinct. All their lives are at risk.</p><p>Back at the mansion, Nori is talking to the rest of her team about her plans to go after the Purifiers. She says she doesn't care what Cyclops says. It was their friends that were killed and they were the ones that took down the Purifiers. If they have the infant mutant, they will simply kill it. She wants to take out the Purifiers, permanently. She asks who is with her. Hellion, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-15078\" href=\"/mercury/4005-15078/\">Mercury</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40456\" href=\"/rockslide/4005-40456/\">Rockslide</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40458\" href=\"/anole/4005-40458/\">Anole</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40673\" href=\"/pixie/4005-40673/\">Pixie</a> all agree, but most simply want to save the baby, not kill anyone. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\" href=\"/dust/4005-4555/\">Dust</a> says they've seen too much blood lately. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\" href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\">Elixir</a> says if he goes, he'll kill every single one of them so he'll stay behind. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4442\" href=\"/armor/4005-4442/\">Armor</a> walks in and says that she'll go with them.</p><p>In Antarctica, the X-Men are about to enter the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40480\" href=\"/marauders/4060-40480/\">Marauders'</a> base. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\" href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> has reported that they are indeed inside.</p><p>In Washington, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10988\" href=\"/rictor/4005-10988/\">Rictor</a> (under the disguise of a mutant hating human called Jake) is taken to the Purifiers' church. He finds out that there are hundreds of churches with members all over the world. He is able to overhear that they do not have the baby in their possession. It is referred to as the Antichrist. They have men in every town within a hundred mile radius of where it was born searching for it. Rictor is pleased to hear that they do not have it. His mission can be over now. Then he sees their newest allies.</p><p>In the future, eighty years from now, Jamie's dupe and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1447\" href=\"/layla-miller/4005-1447/\">Layla Miller</a> finally arrive in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\">New York City</a>. When they arrived in the future, they were in Texas (where they left the present). There has been no signs of mutants. Layla's powers don't work but she says she still has her common sense powers. They go to a library to find out what is going on with the mutants. To their shock, they find out that there is a mutant relocation camp, heavily guarded in Brooklyn.</p><p>Back in the present, the kids arrive in Washington. They work their way in, taking out Purifiers as they go. At the mansion, Elixir tries comforting Prodigy and Dust, saying that Nori will have things under control.</p><p>In Antarctica, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\" href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\">Sinister</a> prepares the Marauders and <a data-ref-id=\"4060-9730\" href=\"/acolytes/4060-9730/\">Acolytes</a> to move out. He says that Cyclops will have figured out where they are soon. He wants to take on the X-Men on his terms. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9734\" href=\"/scalphunter/4005-9734/\">Scalphunter</a> notices that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-9733\" href=\"/harpoon/4005-9733/\">Harpoon</a> is missing. When he asks about him, Harpoon is sent smashing through the wall at them. The X-Men are there. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\">Wolverine</a> tells them they are there for the baby and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\" href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\">Rogue</a>. He asks how many of them have to die before they get them.</p><p>In Washington, Rictor comes across Anole. He asks what are they doing there and tells them that the baby isn't there. The rest are fighting the Purifiers. Things seem to be going well until Hellion is stabbed multiple times from behind. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-8470\" href=\"/lady-deathstrike/4005-8470/\">Lady Deathstrike</a> and the Reavers are there joining the side of the Purifiers.</p>",
