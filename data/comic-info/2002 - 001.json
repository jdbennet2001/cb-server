            "description": "<p><em>Written by Brian K. Vaughan (Lost, EX MACHINA), this is the saga of Yorick Brown - the only human survivor of a planet-wide plague that instantly kills every mammal with a Y chromosome. Accompanied by his pet monkey, Yorick searches for his lost love...and the answer to why he's the last man on earth.</em></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>A crazed woman tries to get a female police officer to help two dying boys. The officer refuses and puts a gun to her head. She explains that all the men are dead.</p><p>29 Minutes Earlier: Yorick Brown hangs upside down in a straight jacket in his New York apartment while talking to his girlfriend Beth. The two are separated while she enjoys time in Australia. He rambles about Elvis until Beth finally gets him to quit stalling and admit that he didn't get his latest applied-for job. He asks Beth to hold as he clicks over to pick up another call from his mother.</p><p>Yorick's mother, Representative Jennifer Brown, is blown off by her son when she asks about his last interview. She hangs up the phone and gets approached by Senator looking for her vote on an abortion amendment. She refuses and things get a little testy. He is called away to meet with the president about \"355.\"</p><p>Yorick is back on the phone with Beth and she senses that he is nervous about something. He nearly tells her but gets interrupted by his pet monkey, Ampersand. He explains to her that the monkey came from a Boston organization and was supposed to help him with chores. Yorick tries to talk to Beth again but Ampersand turns on the television to a report by Christopher Emanuel from Israel.</p><p>In Israel, the reporter wraps up and watch as a female Israeli soldier fires rubber bullets at Palestinians. She orders them away but Christopher, seeing an angle for a story he needs, asks her to escort the news team in exchange for an interview. She reluctantly obliges and gives her name as Tse'Elon.</p><p>The conversation between Yorick and Beth continues: He admits that he is having a hard time getting out some days. She mocks his fear of the outside world.</p><p>Outside in the world, a secret agent drops in on Dr. Frozan Hamad in Jordan. Agent 355 wants to help the refugee doctor escape but is rebuffed. Dr. Hamad isn't afraid of sticking up for her ideals but Agent 355 explains that an amulet is what enemies are after. The doctor explains that the amulet around her neck is a worthless story, one that claims that if the amulet were to leave the country then bad things would happen. She is soon shot down and Agent 355 kills the attackers. She takes the amulet and flees.</p><p>Yorick begins rambling about how much he misses Beth. She stops him to tell him something.</p><p>In a Boston hospital, genetics scientist Dr. Mann asks for help in having a baby delivered. The doctor she sees first is a student from a class she had taught. He is shocked to learn that the baby is a clone. He is ethically opposed to helping deliver a clone but morally opposed to letting a baby die.</p><p>Elsewhere in Boston, Hero Brown, Yorick's sister, tries to get it on in an ambulance with her new firefighter boyfriend. He gets called out, however, and they promise to get together later.</p><p>Back on the phone, Yorick stops Beth from telling him whatever it was going to be and admits that he may have bought a little something for her. He bought a magic ring and proposes to her over the phone.</p><p>At that moment, his mother's assistant Darin dies, as does Christopher Emanuel and his news crew in Israel, Agent 355's male pilot in Jordan, Hero's boyfriend, and every male mammal on the Earth. Except Yorick - who awaits Beth's answer - and Ampersand.</p>",

Out of breath, he wants to report a terrible crime.</p><p>Nearby, in the Business office of Snow White, Beauty and the Beast have some problems of their own. Lord Beast has been having trouble maintaining his human form. He says it is based on Beauty's mood. The more she is mad at him, the more beastly he becomes. Snow, as the Director of Operations, basically tells them they need to deal with their marriage problems on their own. She coldly tells them that even if their operations could afford to give them marriage counseling, she still wouldn't allow it. They have no way to collect taxes for their operations. They have to rely on donations. She tells them that if Beast cannot maintain his human form, he has to either buy a glamor from one of the witches or he can relocate upstate to the Farm (where the other nonhuman Fables live). Beauty is upset. She says they had to escape from the Homelands and lost their fortune. Snow reminds them that most of the Fables lost everything when escaping from the Adversary. When they mention that Snow isn't the Mayor and can't make judgment over them, she reminds them that as the Deputy Mayor, she does have some control. What would happen is if they made an appointment with the mayor, King Cole, he'd go to her for her recommendation and she would tell him the same thing. Snow is the one that does all the real work.</p><p>Beauty's last resort is to mention that Snow has no idea what married life is like. She divorced Prince Charming centuries ago. Beast tries to tell her not to get personal. When Beauty mentions that Snow shouldn't be judging them because of the rumors of her \"adventures\" with the seven dwarves, Snow's face becomes rigid. Her secretary, Boy Blue, quickly comes and tells them that Snow has another appointment and they really need to get going. As he ushers them out, Beauty says they weren't finished. He says they were if she had any hope of surviving her last comment. He says you should never bring up the dwarves to Snow. Bigby comes up and asks if she's in. He tells Bigby that Snow is in a bad mood. Bigby says he's about to make it worse.</p><p>In a restaurant, Prince Charming has come back into town. He has been flirting with his waitress, Molly. He mentions how he would love ask her for her number and she says she'd be tempted to give it. He says that it would cause an awkward moment because since he doesn't have any money, he was planning on skipping out on his dinner. Thinking about it, she says that she would have to cover it anyways so she decides to pay for it and they head over to her place as soon as she gets off.</p><p>In Snow's office, Bigby tries to prepare her for his bad news. She says she already knows her ex is in town. He says it's about her sister, Rose Red. She has been reported missing and may be the victim in a violent crime. Her boyfriend, Jack, reported that her apartment has been trashed. Snow says that's normal. Rose loves to have wild parties and a trashed apartment isn't anything new. Bigby tells her that there's a lot of blood there. He's about to go over and investigate. Snow insists on going with him. He tells her he doesn't think that's a good idea. She says that his only other choice would be to clean out his office and leave the building.</p><p>As they take a cab over to Rose's apartment, Prince Charming is getting it on with his new friend. Bigby tells Snow that he had Jack go and stand guard over Rose's place. When Snow mentions that he could be tainting the crime scene if he was responsible for Rose's disappearance, Bigby says if he wanted to, he would've done that before telling him. They find Jack sitting outside the apartment. He says he couldn't stand to go back inside for a second time. Opening the door, they see that the place is covered with blood. On the wall, written in blood, is \"No more Happily Ever After.\" Bigby tells them to stay outside as he goes inside. He doesn't want any \"Mundy cops\" to see or know anything.</p><p>As Bigby looks around, Snow asks him why he's just standing there when he should check her room. Jack says he already looked there. Bigby checks the place out. He sees the blood everywhere. Furniture knocked over. Going into the (spotless) kitchen, he seems curious to find a padlock that used to be on the freezer. Seeing that it belonged on there, he says, \"Ah Ha!\"</p><p>Going out to the hall, he slams Jack against the wall and says he's bringing him in. Jack asks what for and Bigby says, whatever, it could be for resisting arrest. Jack curses and takes a swing at him. Now he can add attempted assault to the charges. Snow asks if he's the one. Bigby says, \"We'll see.\"</p>",

            "description": "<p>Keitaro Urashima is a 19 year old loser. He is a second year ronin (a student who has failed their college entrance exam) and has been kicked out of his parents' house. He is desperate to get into Tokyo University due to a childhood promise he had made to a girl. He comes to his grandma's inn to stay and study, but when he arrives, there's no one around. Keitaro decides to relax in the open-air bath, when a woman walks in on him. She starts chasing him through the building and is soon joined by the other residents. Finally Keitaro's Aunt Haruka comes to his rescue and reveals that the inn has become a girls dorm and Granny Hina is on a world tour. Haruka is under the impression that Keitaro is actually a Tokyo U. student. Keitaro does nothing to dissuade to her and the other residents of the dorm are impressed and decide to allow Keitaro to stay.</p><p>Later, Naru (the girl who walked in on Keitaro in the bath) tricks Keitaro and discovers that he is not really a Tokyo U. student. She decides not to tell the others because Keitaro had given Shinobu the confidence to work on her grades. The other girls walk in on Keitaro and Naru in a compromising position and in the ensuing chaos, Su discovers Keitaro's prep school ID. The residents of the dorm, upset about being lied to, kick Keitaro out. He tells Haruka that he is going back home, but Haruka tells him that's not possible. Granny Hina has just sent a fax.</p><p>Keitaro is the new landlord of Hinata House.</p><p>The residents of the dorm are angry and decide to make so Keitaro so miserable he'll have no choice but to leave. They make him do all the chores and bathe in a bucket. At first Naru feels sorry for Keitaro, but after several incidents of him accidentally peeping on her, she decides to help. Keitaro overhears their plans and decides to stay.</p><p>Keitaro rushes off to prep school and meets his friends Haitani and Shirai. They discuss a fellow classmate who just happens to be first in the nation. Keitaro bumps into her and he apologizes. The girl reveals herself to be Naru. She wears glasses and looks different at school to concentrate on her grades. Throughout the day, Naru and Keitaro are forced to sit next to each other during class and eat lunch together. At the end of the day, they come home together which causes some consternation among the other roommates.</p><p>Keitaro is having problems studying and decides to ask Naru for help. After a couple of attempts and turning him down, Naru finally agrees. Naru asks him why he is trying so hard to get into Tokyo U. Keitaro tells her about the promise he had made, and askes Naru if she thinks the girl even remembers. Naru gets very starry-eyed and says the girl would absolutely remember. Kitsune knocks on Naru's door and wants in. Keitaro hides under the kotatsu(heated table) so Kitsune won't get the wrong impression.</p><p>Shinobu is still upset after being lied to by Keitaro. Haruka suggests looking through Shinobu's file to see if there's a way Keitaro can make it up to her. His first few attempts are disastrous, but then Keitaro realizes that it is her birthday and throws a surprise party for her. The other residents tell Shinobu that it was Keitaro's idea and she forgives him.</p><p>Keitaro, Haitani, and Shirai are walking home after school when they try to holler at some girls. The girls turn out to be Naru, Motoko, and Su. Motoko uses her umbrella and knocks the three guys out. Back at the dorm, Keitaro asks Naru why Motoko hates him so much. Naru tells him that Motoko is the daugher of a famous kendo master near Kyoto. After several scenes of Keitaro embarrassing Motoko, Motoko realizes that she isn't feeling well. She is light-headed and has trouble breathing. Afraid that she is falling in love with Keitaro, she challenges him to a duel. The duel ends with a tie with them both collapsing; Keitaro from fright and Motoko from a cold. The chapter ends with Motoko glad she's not in love, and Keitaro glad he's still alive.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Cheju Island-a tropical paradise filled with lush forests, and idyllic villages. When Won Miho is sent to the island to teach, the biggest problem she expects to face is a shortage of designer clothing stores. Unfortunately for her, she's about to come face to face with the dark side of Cheju. Here, carnal demons and ancient gods play with mortals to satisfy their lusts-and they've chosen Miho as their next target! In order to survive the horrors that seek her blood, Miho must team up with the mysterious Pan, whose enchanted knife and mastery of magic makes him the only one capable of killing these demons. But what Miho's about to find out is that her savior might be more dangerous than the demons!</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Introducing the delightfully precise and beautifully designed art of Patrick Atangan in a new series of adaptations of traditional Asian tales. This book, drawn in the ukiyo-e style (world of floating pictures), presents \"The Yellow Jar\" which centers around a simple fisherman and a beautiful maiden he takes as wife, after finding her in a magic jar. However, she is abducted by a demon warrior considerably more powerful than the simple fisherman. But the fisherman's resolve, even after many unsuccessful attempts to rescue her, does not flinch... In \"Two Chrysanthemum Maidens\", a monk is faced with two rather strange wild flowers in his carefully tended garden. They are wild and have planted themselves there at will. They are weeds but they are lovely like women.</em></p><p>1. Introduction by P. Craig Russell</p><p>2. The Yellow Jar</p><p>3. Two Chrysanthemum Maidens</p>",

Lost amidst the crooked politicians and corrupt corporate practices of the late 20th century, the American Dream became polluted and drowned out, replaced instead with an ever-growing chasm between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\" No one is more aware of this than Billi Chadam. Daughter of honest industrialist Ray Chadam and heiress to the multi-billion dollar Chadam International empire, Billi finds herself in a whirlpool of murder and corporate espionage, framed for her father's death, and on the run from those who are supposed to be her allies. But Billi has a secret, one she shared with her father before he was taken from her. By night Billi dons the mask of the Sword of Toleado, a blade-wielding vigilante bringing hope to the oppressed and striking fear in the oppressors. There's more to saving her city than sword-waving heroics can accomplish, though, and before the tensions between her company's employees and the city's on-the-take police force reach a boiling point, Billi must set the balance right, no matter what the cost. </em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>In 1991, visionary creator Frank Miller continued his shakedown of the comics industry when he premiered his visceral and powerfully charged <strong>Sin City</strong> series. With <strong>Sin City</strong>, Miller sent a shock wave through the industry and beyond, stunning critics and amazing readers, the after-affects of which are still being felt today. While Miller is primarily praised for his outstanding stories, it is his breathtaking artwork that continues to shine on. To honor the artist and his groundbreaking work, Dark Horse Maverick is pleased to present <strong>Frank Miller: The Art of Sin City</strong>, a unique and handsomely bound hardcover coffee table book, containing pieces both published and unpublished -- some never before seen by the public. Printed on glossy 100 lb. coated paper stock and featuring items ranging from preliminary sketches to promotional pieces, this beautiful edition holds everything a <strong>Sin City</strong> fan, or connoisseur of fine art, could ever hope for.</em></p>",

In an homage to the comics he enjoyed as a kid (such as <strong>Little Lulu</strong> and <strong>Peanuts</strong>), Matt Groening presents stories about Bart and the kids of Springfield with adults taking a backseat as comic foils. <strong>Big Book of Bart Simpson</strong> features several short stories that can be enjoyed by a younger reading audience, but there are plenty of laughs for kids of all ages. It's good old–fashioned fun with the same satiric edge that has made 'The Simpsons' the most successful animated program in television history.</em></p>",

Michael Straczynski's (Babylon 5) adapted TV series for the Sci-Fi Channel, Dark Horse Comics and Strip Art Features bring the latest chapter in Hermann's post-apocalypse adventure epic, <strong>Jeremiah</strong>, to America for the first time in an English-language adaptation. Jeremiah and his cynical sidekick, Kurdy, continue their journey across a shattered, depopulated America, a thrown-back America tribalized by race, religion, and cults of personality. In <strong>Gun in the Water</strong>, Jeremiah and Kurdy, hiding out in a bayou backwater, encounter a dysfunctional family racked with violent passions and trapped by deadly secrets. <strong>Jeremiah</strong> is Hermann at his best, a commanding presence among the guiding lights of graphic fiction.</em></p>",

This trade paperback collects the latest and greatest adventures of Groo, the world's stupidest barbarian. In a savage land of another era, a goodly segment of the world has long been under the heavy thumb of the evil, power-mad despot known as Pipil Khan. The tyrant wants nothing more than to name an heir and shuck his mortal coil, but one thing stands in his way: Groo! It seems Khan just can't rest easy until Groo is out of the way. He'll give his kingdom to the one of his sons who can accomplish this. One of them has a foolproof plan how to do it. Unfortunately for him, it may be that no plan is foolproof enough to thwart Groo.

            "description": "<p><em>The most feared man in the history of the corrupt police state of La Colonia was the Iguana, an unstoppable assassin of monstrous cruelty, debased appetites, and nearly superhuman abilities. Now, he is seemingly dead, but his foul influence still permeates the landscape, inspiring as much terror and loathing in death as in life. When a beautiful and ambitious American tabloid journalist travels to La Colonia to investigate the Iguana's apparent death, she herself becomes entangled in his legacy of savage transgressions and perverse desires, and even a Pulitzer Prize may not be able to wipe away the stain on her soul. Written by <strong>CyberSix</strong> creator Carlos Trillo and illustrated by Roberto Mandrafina, and the sequel to <strong>The Big Hoax</strong>, <strong>The Iguana</strong> is a brutal satire, as disturbing as it is sardonic. Not for the faint of heart, <strong>The Iguana</strong> is another essential Venture graphic album, published in collaboration with Strip Art Features, and available for the first time in an English-language edition!</em></p>",

The older girl can do no wrong and the younger girl is constantly criticised and berated for not living up to her sibling's exemplary standards. Years later, Orochi's spirit returns in the body of another girl. The two sisters are now grown women: the younger sister is a bitter woman, forced to return to her family home after an unsuccessful marriage and the older sister is now a bed-ridden widow with a terminal illness. It seems the younger sister has been made bitter and sadistic by her traumatic childhood but maybe the seemingly angelic older sister isn't quite as perfect as she seems.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p>GOGIRL! TPB</p><p>Back in the day, Janet Goldman was an honest-to-goodness flying superhero, the far out Go-Go Girl. But Go-Go Girl eventually hung up her costume -- well, put it away in a dresser drawer -- and now her teenage daughter, Lindsay, has inherited Mom's flying powers, donned her old costume, and become the teenage superheroine sensation Go Girl! Now she's fighting crime and righting wrongs...with an occasional leg up from the now semi-retired Go-Go Girl. Pouring the classic charm of comics of the past through a subtle modernist filter, series creator/writer Trina Robbins and artist Anne Timmons have crafted an all-ages delight, garnering critical praise and a coveted Lulu Award. The GoGirl! collection includes pinups by Barb Rausch, Steve Leiber, Lea Hernandez, Sergio Aragonés, and others and bonus features, including material never before seen in the GoGirl! series.</p><p>\"...wonderful, charming.\"</p><p>-- Phil Mateer, All About Books and Comics</p><p>CREATORS</p><ul><li>Writer: Trina Robins</li><li>Artist: Anne Timmons</li><li>Letterer: Tom Orzechowski &amp; Sean Glumace</li><li>Editor: Chris Warner</li><li>Designer: Lia Ribacchi</li><li>Cover Artist: Anne Timmons</li><li>Genre: Humor, Action/Adventure</li><li>Publication Date: October 23, 2002</li><li>Format: SC, 136pg, b&amp;w, 6 x 9</li><li>Price: $15.95</li><li>ISBN-10: 1-56971-798-2</li><li>ISBN-13: 978-1-56971-798-1</li></ul>",
