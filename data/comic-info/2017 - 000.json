Everyone excitedly awaits the birth of the next guardian, but when a dangerous demon rapidly approaches it is up to Tane to defend the town while his wife deals with a difficult delivery. Unbeknownst to him, the events that take place in the small delivery room will affect the village for generations to come. <strong>Little Guardians</strong> tells the story of two young people switched at birth and now unknowingly living each other's lives. Idem trains as the next guardian and struggles to control his spirit powers. This was Subira's birthright, but tradition dictates the guardian line must be passed down from father to son. Over time she must discover the truth behind her connection to the spirit world and in the process save her village from an evil cult.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>MATT WAGNER returns with the third and final volume of his epic fantasy trilogy—MAGE: THE HERO DENIED. This long-awaited conclusion follows the adventures of the reluctant everyman hero Kevin Matchstick, who, after encountering a shaggy and beguiling wizard, discovers he is the reincarnation of the legendary Pendragon and able to wield the power of the mystical weapon, Excalibur. The story picks up several years after the fateful climax of THE HERO DEFINED and finds Kevin beginning to once again doubt the virtue of his actions and the course of his destiny.</em></p><p><em>This introductory, half-sized issue #0 continues MAGE’s tradition of an “Interlude” short-adventure, bridging the gap between this series and the previous storyline. It also acts as a perfect jumping-on spot for new readers.</em></p>",

The Avengers risk their lives to make the world a safer place for all, oftentimes suffering severe injury and great loss. When Tony Stark faces a more personal threat - one leveled against Pepper Potts - the risk is too great to ignore, and he's forced to act fast. What lengths will Tony go to in order to keep Pepper safe? Iron Man is an important part of his life, but can he figure out a way to replace the armor and step away from being an Avenger, if that's what it takes?
