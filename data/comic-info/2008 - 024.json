            "description": "<p>As their quest to track down Sinestro Corps rings continues, the Green Lantern Corps discover to their horror that fellow Lanterns Sodam and Arisia have been captured by Mongul and subjected to the dreaded Black Mercy, causing their deadliest fears to be dragged into the light.</p> <p>⇖ The remaining group of Green Lantern—including Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, Bzzd, Stel and Sorak Natu—follow the signatures of their missing comrades. The search leads the Green Lanterns to a planet that is full of dead body parts. The Lanterns continue onward into the planet's atmosphere as they try to avoid hitting anymore body parts than they can possibly help. </p> <p>⇖ When the Lanterns finally enter the planet, they discover plants that Kyle and Guy recognize as Black Mercy, and when you deal with Black Mercy, Mongul must be nearby. </p> <p>⇖ Isamot says he's heard a bit on Mongul but nothing of the plant called Black Mercy. Guy and Kyle use their rings to give the rest of the Lanterns a refresher course on Mongul. With the lesson over, there is a bit of discussion about the the definition of justice and when it's appropriate to take a life. The conversation is interrupted by Kyle and Guy who tell the rest of the Lanterns that they need to deal with Mongul and rescue their fellow Lanterns </p> <p>⇖ Meanwhile, we see Kilowog and Salaak observing the Guardians construct more and more sciencells for yellow power rings. Salaak says that he will be happy when each and every ring is finally under their control to which Kilowog disagrees. He doesn't like having the rings here and if it was up to him, he would have them destroyed, but he's not allowed to finish his sentence as Salaak tells him it's not up to him so there is no need to continue the conversation. Kilowog leaves and tells Salaak to give Voz his regards. </p> <p>⇖ Inside the sciencell, Voz is listening to one of the Sinestro Corps members as she tells him that her cell will not hold them for long and threatens Vox's family and friends from his sector of 571. Vox replies that he's free to do whatever he wants and she is not and that is the way it will remain forever. Vox than sees that Salaak has brought Vox severed arms to guard and he tells Vox that these severed parts with the rings must be guarded as closely as the terrorists within these cells must be. We see Sinestro biting off skin on his finger as he uses his blood to design something on his cell window. We see other Corps members doing the same thing as Sinestro, we see that they are all making the symbol for the Red Lantern Corps. </p> <p>⇖ Elsewhere, we see what the Black Mercy is doing to both Sodam Yat and Arisia. With Sodam, he fears that he will be forgotten. He pleads that he has too much left to prove and too much left to lose. He sees death in the form of a rainbow. He pleads that he doesn't want to be the last. Arisia on the other hand is waiting for someone to save her. She finally has her life back and she doesn't want to die. She remembers dying and how it sucked and she doesn't want to be pulled back into the darkness. </p> <p>⇖ Mongul taunts the Green Lanterns under his control. He tells them how fear is control and when you have someone's deepest fears at their fingertips, they become mere puppets on a string. His underling, Duel Eknham, says he hates this place. His other head says that they could tear apart these two perfectly killable Green Lanterns. The two heads talk about how great it would be to dismember them until Mongul stops them. Mongul then uses the power of the yellow ring to reverse engineer the Black Mercy seeds and shoots them into space to instill great fear. </p> <p>⇖ The group of Lanterns are hacking the Black Mercy plants when Bzzd informs the other Lanterns that he sees several yellow lights heading into deep space. The Lanterns follow the yellow light to find a bunch of really big Black Mercy plants with Arisia and Sodam Yat inside. When Sorak Natu tries to get their status, her ring tells her that they are slowly being digested by the plant. The Lanterns begin to destroy the plants which they eventually do. Sorak Natu begins to try and work on getting the Black Mercy plants off Sodam Yat and Arisia when it looks like the Lanterns seem to fall out of the frying pan and into the fire. Green Lantern Corps, meet Mother Mercy.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Cade Skywalker determines to deal with the Empire once and for all in this conclusion to one of the most important stories of the year!</p><p>When a reunion with old friends is compromised by an Imperial intrusion, Cade realizes there's only one way to stop the Sith-a way that requires a fast ship, a custom-made blaster, and most of all, allies you can trust. Yet not all in his party are who they seem to be, and if Cade's not careful, he might just doom the galaxy's last ray of hope to a dark and devastating fate.</p><p>Introduces a surprising new member to the <i>Legacy</i> cast!</p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>With Cade being one of the most hunted men in the galaxy, it’s time to get lost and relax or is it?</p><p>Cade, Blue, and Syn are relaxing and playing having just arrived Cade’s Uncle Bantha Rawk’s place. While Syn plays with the kids, Micah, Ahnah, and Skeeto, Cade and his Uncle Bantha go to his uncle’s workshop to discuss the previous events in Cade’s life. After his uncle is all caught up, we find out that his uncle’s real name is or was Nat Skywalke, and his uncle discusses everything he knows about Cade’s Mother, Morrigan Corde. Before they rejoin the others his uncle tells Cade how important family is, and how his wife Droo and the kits are everything to him.</p><p>There lovely dinner is broken up when they see the slaughter that had happened on Dac broadcasting on the news. Followed by a report seeking the known terrorist Cade Skywalker. At this Cade decides it is time to leave because he has put his uncle’s family in danger, especially with the Black Sun spotting his ship on arrival, but Rawk will not allow this. He points out how Cade has no plan like always and that his ship is unique and easily recognizable. Rawk instructs everyone not to panic and not to be afraid, and that they will discuss everything in the morning.</p><p>In the middle of the night Cade gets out of bed, telling Blue that he can’t sleep, and proceeds out to his ship to find his stash of deathsticks. Luke and Kol Skywalker appear through the force to talk Cade out of using the deathstick to quite the force, but instead to use jedi methods such as meditation. Cade yells at his father for never coming back to him before seven years and Kol explains how all the deathsticks Cade was taking kept him away. Cade won’t have it and takes a deathstick to relax and lose the ghosts.</p><p>After a while of feeling happy from the deathstick, Cade gets kicked in the face. It is the unnamed figure that followed him all the way there, pointing a blaster at Cade. Cade’s uncle Rawk then appears and uses the force to take the blaster from the unnamed assailant. The assailant then force throws a big object at Rawk, which he dodges, only to have a lightsaber drawn in his face. Rawk then disarms the assailant and she concedes with Rawk pointing the lightsaber at her. The assailant is then revealed to be Azlyn Rae, former jedi apprentice with Cade, whom he thought to be dead. They proceed inside to have a drink and Azlyn tells her story. How she escaped and then worked doing odd jobs, until she became a bounty hunter, which led her to hunt Cade. The long range scanners then go off warning that an Imperial Star Destroyer is approaching, and Cade, Blue, and Syn hide.</p><p>Captain Gurlock and stormtroopers had arrived and are now beating Rawk and Azlyn to find out about Cade’s Ship, as reported by the Black Sun. Azlyn uses he mind control over the captain to convince him that he was lied to, that Cade wasn’t there, and that the Black Sun needed to pay for lying.</p><p>Two hours later Rawk is telling Cade to disappear completely, Change everything, his name, ship, and friends. But Cade has is own plan, to KILL DARTH KRAYT! However Cade needs allies and says how he doesn’t trust Emperor Fel, doesn’t know about Admiral Stazi, and there are no Jedi. Rawk then says the later is not true. There is a hidden Jedi temple and he will take Cade there.</p><p>Azlyn is then revealed to be a double agent. While alone moving her ship she contacts the Imperial Knights to inform them of Cade’s latest plan, that of the hidden temple, and says she will send the coordinates when she knows them. The Imperial Knights are confident in Azlyn but are prepared if she turns against them.</p>",
