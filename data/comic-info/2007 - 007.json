The bad guys you expect. The gangsters and the hoods with old axes to grind. They all come with the territory. But the heroes--them you don’t expect. Popping up to give you the eyeball and make sure you’re toeing the line. Their line. Spider-Man and his wisecracks...Frank Castle, the angel of death himself, telling you he’ll be keeping an eye on you...even the fugitive Captain America, with a word to say about crashing aircraft into the sides of buildings in New York City. And now, this other thing. Someone is out there. Someone hitting the old haunts, scenes of the old crimes. Leaving messages. Leaving bodies. Someone who knows you. Someone who crushes steel and pulls off limbs. All to get your attention. Someone out of your league!</i></p><p>Spider-Man makes a brief crossover appearance from the Civil War story arc. Marc Spectre (Moon Knight) seaks out the help of old mercenary friends. He has been baddly beaten from a previous fight, and the bruises on his face are actually startling. It appears that Spectre wants to get his helicopter flying again. He enlists the help of Jean-Paul his French ex-mercenary buddy.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Part 2 of acclaimed novelist Jodi Picoult's instant-classic WONDER WOMAN run finds Nemesis the victim of a trap laid for the Amazon Warrior, and Diana Prince under extreme pressure from Sarge Steel to caption her alter ego! The clues to Nemesis' fate lie in the now-abandoned Wonder Woman museum, but what awaits Diana is an even deadlier trap!</i></p><p>Wonder Woman comes to Tesser's (Nemesis) rescue and Circe comments how predictable it would be for her to come and save someone. Circe attacks her, sending her across the room. Wonder Woman stands up again, and blocks an attack from Circe's blasts. However, the blasts turn into snakes. She snaps them, going for Circe and taking her down. She starts taunting her, asking if she will kill her now. Circe then escapes and unties the bound Tesser. He is hurt, and takes him to the Vetinary Surgeon because she is still a fugitive. She heals his cuts. Puzzled, she asks him if he should be arresting her now, but he replies that he doesn't like to be told what to do, especially when he isn't told everything.</p><p>Tom then suggests a bar where Circe could be hiding, but she should note that it is a bar where people are <em>dressed</em> as villains. They both go inside, and asks a fan of Wonder Woman's, the bartender, where she can find Circe. The bartender points her towards the toilet. She escapes into another portal. Then, Sarge Steel and his armed forces burst through capturing Wonder Woman in a net. Steel then congratulates Tom for leading them to Wonder Woman. Tom looks confused, and Steel replies that they had placed a tracker on him.</p><p>Wonder Woman agrees to come in peacefully, and at the Department of Metahuman Affairs, Steel takes an elevator deep in the building. There, Wonder Woman is being held in a clear holding cell and questions her about the Purple Death Ray which had been used against the OMACs. She refuses to answer and finds herself zapped by the cell.</p><p>Meanwhile, Circe asks the gods' permissions to travel to Themyscira. At Themyscira, two Amazons go about their daily business when they find that the eternal flame has gone out. It can't be out... only a hand of evil could have done this. They then hear a voice and turn around with Circe behind them. \"Death's a bitch darling...and then you're born again.\"</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>DYNAMITE ENTERTAINMENT is proud to welcome Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson's The Boys as they present issue #7 of the series!</i></p><p><em>The series continues from Dynamite with issue #7 as Butcher takes Wee Hughie to meet the Boys' greatest weapon against the Supes: a man called \"The Legend.\" Plus, meet the troubled hero Tek Knight - a man with a problem so unusual you'll have to read this comic to believe it!</em></p><p><em>Starting with issue #7, Dynamite is your new home for The Boys each and every month. Find out for yourself why everyone's been talking about The Boys!</em></p><p>Tek Knight, a hero of the super-team, Payback visits a psychiatrist. He has developed a problem in which he wants to have relations with anything he can. After a false tip to capture a terrorist army, Payback was flying back to their headquarters. He became aware of fellow teammate and robot, Mind-Droid's rear end. He tried having relations with him in mid-flight and was suspended from the team. He has gone on to make attempts on several other things. He finally gets kicked out of the doctor's office and told never to return when he tried to have his way with the doctor's coffee cup when he left to answer the phone.</p><p>Wee Hughie is called in to see Butcher. He finds the rest of the Boys sitting around. He is surprised that Frenchman and the Female are just playing Monopoly on a Cluedo board. Mother's Milk tells him that they're both crazy and are waiting to put the hurt on someone else. Wee Hughie then receives a black overcoat similar to what the others all wear. He now really feels like part of the team.</p><p>Hughie meets with Butcher and they discuss the coat. Butcher tells him that if they get in a fight to just hit anything not wearing one. They arrive at Vinnie's Comics. As they wait to meet with The Legend, Butcher tells Hughie the secrets of the real heroes. Comic books are just a front. The truth is the supes all pretty much have their dark secrets. Butcher says that they are an asset to them because they wouldn't be able to blackmail the supes if the truth was made public.</p><p>When Butcher introduces Hughie to the Legend, they are given what will become their next case. The Legend's sister's grandson was recently thrown off a rooftop and the police are not doing much to find out who is responsible. The Legend says that the supe known as Swingwing is involved. Swingwing was Tek Knight's first Laddio, his sidekick.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tek Knight is doing all he can to resist the temptation of the current Laddio. When Laddio wants to have a workout and bends over to do some streches in front of Tek Knight, he knows he needs to send him off. Tek Knight is left wondering who he can get to help him with his problem.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Wonder Woman and Power Girl fight side-by-side against a foe who may be more powerful than both of them combined! </p><p>After battling some mummies, Power Girl picks up Wonder Woman's lasso.  When Diana asks Kara where she's going next, she replies, \"To murder Superman in his Fortress...\"</p><p>The issue opens up with Power Girl and Wonder Woman fighting their way through mummies, and Wonder Woman says she sees a solution on how to finish this. She asks Power Girl to clear a way for her towards altar, but Power Girl doesn’t see what she means. Wonder Woman says she’s not starting an argument, but she believes that in Man’s World, brute force doesn’t accomplish anything. She unhooks her lasso and wraps it around the altar, which holds a glowing orange ball and yanks it off with her lasso. An explosion happens and all the mummies fall to dust. Wonder Woman thanks Power Girl and Power Girl is just as confused as she asks what she did to defeat them. Wonder Woman explains that she noticed mummies nearest the altar fought with greater strength, so the orb gave them a life-force.</p><p>Power Girl says that wisdom wins this time, but brute strength will work next time. She picks up Wonder Woman’s lasso and gives it to Wonder Woman. At that point, Wonder Woman asks where Power Girl is off to, and while holding the lasso, Power Girl says, “To murder Superman in his fortress.” The both of them stand shocked and Power Girl is confused as to why she would say such a thing. Wonder Woman says that she was holding the lasso; that’s why she was telling the truth, but she also adds that she was surprised when she told the truth. Wonder Woman adds that Power Girl looked like she was hypnotised when she said that.</p><p>Power Girl shoots off to the sky and says she’s going to find who’s controlling her. Wonder Woman tells her to wait and wraps the lasso around Power Girl. She struggles to let go, and threatens to snap her lasso. Wonder Woman replies that it’s not just a “rope”, it’s a magic lasso and even Kryptonians are even vulnerable to magic. Power Girl replies that she is not from this universe, so it doesn’t affect her. She tells Wonder Woman that she respects her and will give her a chance to let her go. Wonder Woman replies that since Superman is in danger, it’s everyone business and adds that they’re alike. Power Girl replies that they’re nothing alike. Wonder Woman calms her down, and asks her to remember anything during the week. Power Girl thinks and remembers Thursday, which was just her usual day in the office. On Wednesday, she remembers the same thing and on Tuesday she didn’t even leave headquarters, but on Monday, it comes up blank. Wonder Woman tells her to calm down. Power Girl then remembers a stone; a yellowish stone in her fist. Power Girl then continues on about an alchemist, a man in the shadows, and she remembers the name “Megistus”. Wonder Woman then thinks up the library and thinks up the worst case scenario with “Not that…”</p><p>Wonder Woman goes on to explain the Royal Library of Alexandria and that it was the storehouse of all human knowledge. It contained thousands of scrolls and carvings recording the secrets of the Ages. Megistus, who was a powerful wizard and saw the library as only loot and so he plundered the library on the texts about alchemical science. Then he burned the library. They arrive outside the library as Power Girl carries a chest full of oils and Wonder Woman with a large jar. Wonder Woman mixes a few ingredients together. Wonder Woman explains that Amazonian faith has taught them many things – Power Girl interrupts and asks if it’s patience – but Wonder Woman says that it has taught them that the library still exists. Power Girl says that the library is burned down, but Wonder Woman replies that she was just recounting a legend. She continues to explain that the fire was just an illusion. He really didn’t destroy it, but stole it and put it in his own dimension. A portal opens from the ingredients Wonder Woman mixed together from before. Power Girl asks if they walk in, but Wonder Woman says that they “knock”. Together, they punch the portal and are transported to the library. Power Girl comments on the state of the library, and how much dusting it would need. Wonder Woman replies that it isn’t covered in dust, but it’s <em>made</em> of dust. She explains how ironic how this library is, as it holds all kinds of secrets but no one can read it, because if anyone does, this library would surely fall apart.</p><p>As Wonder Woman and Power Girl fall into their arguments again, Power Girl finds the man and shoots straight for him, almost destroying the library. Wonder Woman tells Power Girl to calm down because they don’t know what they’re up against. The strange man replies that Power Girl certainly knows who she’s up against, and introduces himself as Mr. Alchemy, heir to Megistus. He holds up the Philosopher’s Stone and explains to Power Girl that she should’ve listened to Wonder Woman and exercised patience. Now, he is the one ambushing <em>her</em>. He then casts a spell, “Stone to air, oxygen… to cyanide.” Wonder Woman is unprepared, but Power Girl explains that she doesn’t need to breathe. “Some just need to cave your face in!” she continues. She gets him to drop his weapon, and he complies, too easily, and throws it to Power Girl. Wonder Woman, struggling to breathe, tells her to drop the stone, but it’s too late. Mr. Alchemy sends his spirit into the stone, through to Power Girl. Power Girl, controlled by Mr. Alchemy then begins destroying the library and Wonder Woman is shocked.</p><p>Through Power Girl, Mr. Alchemy explains that with the Stone, he absorbed everything in the library without even touching it. Now that he can destroy it through Power Girl, he is the only one that knows the knowledge contained within the library. He asks Wonder Woman, “Comforting?” while she is buried under the debris. He continues to explain that she shouldn’t be concerned with the library of yesterday, and should be concerned with the man of tomorrow and continues to explain that it’s Superman she should be worried about, as his Fortress of Solitude is about to become a tomb of solid kryptonite. Power Girl punches Wonder Woman out, and carries Mr. Alchemy’s body out, off to kill Superman.<br /></p><p>In the Arctic Circle, Superman comments on the great location of his Fortress of Solitude and perfect for a private meeting; he greets Power Girl. Power Girl says, “So many colours to choose from. Gold, green, white…” and Superman is confused by this. Power Girl then says, “But this is my favourite, “and brings out the alchemical one, the one that brings change, red kryptonite. Superman transform into a strange alien form. While Mr. Alchemy continues to rant on, Power Girl fights through, with “Kal?”, but he tells her to stay down and not to interfere. Mr. Alchemy explains that Wonder Woman is racing here to set this right. He continues to say that there’s no way she could sneak up on her, even with all her stealth and grace and says that she is no where in sight, when Wonder Woman flies through and hits Power Girl. Wonder Woman punches Power Girl, without knowing that Mr. Alchemy has gone out of Power Girl’s body and Power Girl tells her that it’s her again. Wonder Woman trusts her and she unhooks her lasso and holds the stone with her lasso. Wonder Woman tells her to take care of Superman. Wonder Woman then flies up in the sky and asks Athena to forgive for what she is about to do and throws the stone up into the sun. Wonder Woman returns and Power Girl tells her that Superman is going to be okay. She asks her Power Girl where she dropped Mr. Alchemy’s body, and Power Girl replies in London. She also asks if the body had reconnected with the stone. Wonder Woman ponders that if it did… because Wonder Woman had thrown it into the sun, and so he must’ve been destroyed as well.</p><p>Superman then asks humorously, how an attack, that left the Fortress of Solitude in debris, is considered a strategic attack? Wonder Woman explains that she was trying to scatter as much kryptonite as possible. Power Girl mentions that she rammed a plane into Superman’s house. Wonder Woman replies that it wasn’t the best, but it still worked. Power Girl and Wonder Woman fly off to allow Superman to rebuild his house. </p><p>Some days later, a man and a woman are reading a book and the man is reading about the incident that happened with the Philosopher’s Stone. The fact that it happened only days ago, but is seen in an ancient paper is strange. The man also comments on the second mention of “Megistus” and that “feels like the key”. The man asks another man who has just come in to investigate that and says that he will, but first, “Phoenix.” Another man then interrupts, and tells them that reports of an animal was seen downtown, and that all the animals there are extinct.</p>",

Eddie has a message for Ryusuke, and it doesn't sound like fan mail. Ryusuke's bullet-ridden guitar and secret weapon, Lucille, has an admirer that will stop at nothing to get her. Meanwhile, Maho has a new suitor...but do all the best cowboys really have Chinese eyes? Saku and Koyuki share more than a lust for life--they are chasing the same girl. What else can happen to Beck? Is a U.S. tour in the works?</i>",
