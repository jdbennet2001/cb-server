Illustrated by Moore's favorite demented artist, Jacen Burrows, NEONOMICON pulls no punches as every full-colored page is covered in nightmares brought to gruesome life.</i></p><p><i>Agents Brears and Lamper are missing. Vanished without a trace from Salem Massachusetts. And the only clues available to the FBI are the gibberish ramblings of Randolph Carter and a book of the occult that makes even less sense.
