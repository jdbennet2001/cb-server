When Steel attacks Luthor, Luthor's very own superhero team comes to his rescue. Natasha is among the six members of the team, and throws her uncle off Luthor. Natasha then punches Steel through a window and fights him on the ground below, revealing her newly created superpowers. Steel tries to talk some sense into Natasha and tell her that she is a fool to think that Luthor would grant her powers so easily. Natasha wants none of this, and uses her powers of light to defeat her Steel, who is in his new stainless steel form.</p><p>Another Planet.</p><p>Animal Man, Adam Strange and Starfire have been trapped and tied up or caged in a cave. They have been captured by Devilance the Pursuer, a giant hunter who is the 'god of the pursuit.' His only purpose is to hunt. Starfire realizes that the entire planet is just a trap created by Devilance. Animal Man comes up with a plan. When Adam Strange's jetpack distracts Devilance, Buddy temporarily blinds Devilance using powers absorbed from wasps, and Starfire takes away the giant hunter's lance. The three get away, but Devilance continues to pursue them. Adam Strange reasons that there has been a contract put on their lives, and that every bounty hunter in the universe is after them.</p><p>Week 9, Night 1.</p><p>Gotham City.</p><p>Question, in a disguise, finds Renee Montoya in a bar. He tells her that he has answers for her, and beckons her outside. There he tells her that Gotham City is being targeted by Intergang, with a red-headed Batwoman listening from the rooftop.</p>",

Hal presumes that Brainiac never wanted him dead, aiming only to keep the ring off Earth. Examining Captain Cold, Hal discovers miniaturized mind-control worms in his brain.

Yes, in this volume of Trigun, our hero Vash takes a bit of a rest, and he certainly deserves one. So, now we'll study a boyhood relationship, one that, in this very volume, just might come to a destructive and angry end. Though, it may be a bit tough for either one of these \"friends\"to knock each other off. They both have secrets up their sleeves, and Livio, well he might even have an extra sleeve!</i></p>",
