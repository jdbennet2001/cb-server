            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p> <p>Following the events of MESSIAH COMPLEX, X-Factor Investigations is in shambles. Jamie is a basketcase from his trip to a nightmarish future, Layla’s fate is completely in the air, and Wolfsbane has to leave the team to join X-FORCE, though none of her friends can know about it. What will Wolfsbane tell the X-Factor team? What are they going to do about Layla? How is Jamie coping with his guilt? Get onboard here for X-Factor’s brand-new direction!</p> <p>Siryn goes to church to confess her sins of using the Lord's name in vain, coveting M's iPhone, impure thoughts about Jamie, and getting \"knocked up\" with his kid.</p> <p>At X-Factor Investigations, Rahne is telling Jamie that she has to leave X-Factor. He doesn't understand why and she is unable to tell him it is to join the secret covert team, X-Force. He just can't forgive her for leaving at such a bad time. As he begins walking out the room, she jumps in front of him and tell him that she killed him and Layla in the future. Tryp Senior showed her the vision of them being dead on Jamie and Layla's wedding night (when she was grown up). Jamie said Layla's gone so it's okay. Rahne says that she'll be back.</p> <p>Rictor is out walking and thinks he sees Layla walk around the corner. Rictor runs after her. Turns out it's not her but a young girl that looks like her, working the streets. He begins to lecture her and grabs her wrist. When she says that hurts, her pimp and his cronies is nearby. Itching for a fight, Rictor slugs the guy. With four against one, (the girl zaps him with a taser), things don't look too good. Until Strong Guy comes and saves him. Rictor is tired of everyone thinking he constantly needs help. </p> <p>M laughs when she hears Rahne is leaving. She doesn't believe her. Monet takes out an iPhone and says it's for her. She says that she got one for Theresa because she kept eyeing hers and it was bothering her. She didn't want everyone being jealous so she just bought one for them all. Right as she's going to hand it to Rahne, she crushes it in her hand since she's leaving. She tells her if she changes her mind and comes back, she still has one in the box that was meant for Layla.</p> <p>Strong Guy calls Jamie outside the hospital where Rictor is getting patched up. As he leaves a message, Jamie walks by him. He says he's looking for someone to beat up. Guido follows him as Jamie walks into an apparent condemned building that is really a local chapter of the Purifiers. Jamie just strolls in and the leader recognizes him right away. He says he should have killed him the instant he saw him. Jamie tells him he's right, takes out a gun and shoots the guy. Stomping his foot, there are more ready to take on the entire room full of Purifiers.<br /></p> <p>It turns out that Jamie used a tranq gun on their leader. Interestingly enough, the M on his face reappears.</p> <p>Theresa tells Monet that she's pregnant. Rictor tries telling Jamie about the sudden split going on in Mutant Town since some have lost their powers and mutant-appearance. There's other stuff going down but no one will listen to what he's seeing. Then he finds out that he's not even talking to Jamie but rather one of his dupes. He figures Rahne will listen to him. Going upstairs he finds her room empty save for an envelope with his name on it.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The bizarre introduction of the Alpha Lanterns concludes as the trial of the Lost Lantern ends! But what does the induction of the Alpha Lanterns mean to the future of the Corps? What fate awaits the rest of the Lost Lanterns? Plus, Hal has a startling revelation about the \"Blackest Night!\" (per solicitation)<br/></p><p>• On Ysmault, Attrocitus and Qull argue about the current predicament. Qull explains that it was he who planted the seeds of fear in Abin Sur, who then brought these concerns to the Guardians of the Universe. Attrocitus then countered that due to his recklessness, the Guardians of the Universe sentenced them to the dismal world of Ysmault to rot for eternity instead of being sentenced to a sciencell. However, years and years of hate festering inside of Attrocitus has given him the knowledge to escape his prison and as he kills Qull in rage, he vows revenge against the being who calls himself the \"Greatest of All Green Lanterns\". Sinestro. </p><p>• Hal Jordan explains how billions of years ago, the Guardians took it on themselves to bring order into the universe. They created the Manhunters and they brought order to the worlds that had never seen it before. However, the Manhunters used excessive force and sometimes, wrongful arrests of beings and then there was the massacre of sector 666 which is only known to the Guardians and the Manhunters. When the Manhunters brought a war to OA, the Guardians turned to sentient beings to police the Universe, creating the Green Lantern Corps. Now, the Guardians have developed a new faction within the Green Lantern Corps: The Alpha Lanterns who are part Green Lantern and part Manhunter. They are the Internal Affairs of the Green Lantern Corps. </p><p>• Boodikka arrest Laira for the murder of Amon Sur as Laira can't believe the change in her former \"Lost Lantern.” As Hal sees what is happening before him, he thinks back to what Sinestro told him and he begins to believe him. The Universe is starting to change and Hal knows that Sinestro's hands are all over it. Hal was told he didn't have to stay for the trial, but he feels that he owes Laira at least that much and decides to stay. </p><p>• Hal explains that he feels bad for Laira. That she's had it rough even before becoming a \"Lost Lantern\" at the hands of Hal Jordan as Parallax. Hal also explains that her father was considered a renegade Green Lantern as well. When Laira attempted to arrest him, he committed suicide. It's why Hal feels she took the fight against the Sinestro Corps too personally and killed twice as many members as anyone else. She was blinded by hatred. </p><p>• Laira begins her defense by saying that the first new law allows lethal force against members of the Sinestro Corps members. She continues on by saying that Amon Sur had killed Ke'Haan's family and many other innocents. The Guardians then ask Malet Dasim of sector 103 to present the indictment. While Malet Dasim takes great pride in the trials of the enemies of the Corps, he takes no pleasure in being the prosecution against a fellow Green Lantern member. Malet Dasim continues by saying that even though Amon Sur was armed with his Sinestro ring, he was in the process of surrendering when Laira delivered a fatal blow to his upper torso. He continues saying that any chance of Amon's survival vanished when Laira incinerated his corpse and assaulted fellow Green Lantern members when confronted with what she had done. Malet Dasam charges Laira with the murder of Amon Sur, assault and resisting arrest. </p><p>• Hal contemplates the last time he was here, it was for Sinestro's trial and he remembered how he fought for him. Hal wants to stand up for Laira and defend her. Even though Hal feels that lethal force should be only a last resort, he just doesn't feel that it applied in this case. </p><p>• The Guardians have heard the evidence and ask Laira if she has anything to say in her defesne to which she replies that she has no need to defend herself. She says that she did what the new law asked of her and if she had the chance to do it again, she would do the exact same thing. Boodikka then tells Laira that she lashed out with anger that is buried deep within her heart and she is on the road to becoming a renegade Green Lantern. Boodikka delivers her judgement: expulsion from the Green Lantern Corps. Outraged by this and with the memory of her shame due to her father, Laira lashes out only to be stopped by Boodikka. </p><p>• The Guardians tell Laira that she has misrepresented the Green Lantern Corps and that she has been stripped of her ring and her status within the Corps and will be returned homewolrd of Jayd. The Guardians hope that Laira will understand what she has done by misusing their light and perhaps the ring will one day find her again. Then, the Guardians turn their attention to the new laws of OA, the first one already in use. With lethal force against the Sinestro Corps now enabled and the Alpha Lanterns in place, the Guardians are now ready to enact the second new law: Lehtal force now enabled against all enemies of the Green Lantern Corps. As Hal hears the rings telling them that lethal force has been enabled, he thinks to himself that he can hear Sinestro laughing. </p><p>• Hal visits Sinestro in his sciencell, Sinestro wondering why Hal is there. He wonders if Hal is there shed a tear for the future of an old friend or if he's here to reminisce about, as earthmen calls it, the “good old days.” Sinestro reminds him of the time Hal went to find Carl Ferris to get revenge and it was Sinestro who showed Hal the right direction. Just as he showed the Guardians the right direction, Sinestro says that he knows the Guardians have revealed the second new law and Hal replied that Sinestro already knew this was going to happen. Sinestro responds by saying that it's very easy to predict the Guardians. They feel they must suppress all emotions and that the only way to fight the prophecy of destruction is to combat and extinguish the powers of the emotional spectrum. Sinestro says that instead of fighting the prophecy, they should be preparing for it. </p><p>• Hal asks Sinestro what prophecy he's talking about, but Sinestro ecplains that Hal already knows. Sinestro said he heard it from his friend Abin Sur. Sinestro explains that other Corps will arise. There will be a war between them and because of the war, the Blackest Night will be realized. Sinestro understands that the Guardians will panic when they realize they can't stop the prophecy, but Sinestro is confident that by the time they face the unknown shadows that will threaten the universe, the Green Lantern Corps will be reorganized into a force that will be able to crush any and all chaos. Sinestro believes in Green Lantern Corps and asks Hal if he does. </p><p>• The Guardians see a flash of red. They realize that the existence of the Sinestro Corps marks the beginning of all powers from the other spectrums being harnessed and that the Guardians must stay the war of light. Suddenly the scarred Guardian joins the other Guardians. She apologizes for not being around for the unveiling of the second law and tells the other Guardians that she has made a most troubling discovery, one who calls himself Agent Orange. </p><p>• Over in the binary star system of the Controllers, they are contemplating the fact that they have failed where the Guardians have not and that every attempt to build their answer to the Green Lantern Corps had failed. They failed with the Darkstars and the experiment with Effigy proved to be too unstable. They decided that they too must have a power source to tap from the fabric of sentient emotion. They want control of the universe and in order to that, the Controllers must locate the Orange Light. </p><p>• In sector 112, Hanuu is escorting Laira back to her homeworld in a ship. Hanuu apologizes to Laira for what has transpired, but Laira replies that without Ke'Haan and the Corps, she is no longer a \"Lost Lantern,” just lost. Hanuu tells Laira that there is a chance for her to regain her ring back, but Laira tells Hanuu that she does not need her green power ring to make the Sinestro Corps members burn. Then something happens and Laira's eyes begin to bleed and she seems to see nothing but red. Then a red power ring comes to her and says, \"Laira of Sector 112. You have great rage in your heart.\" The ring then floats onto her hand. Laira's eyes begin to glow red and she spits out a red substance from her mouth. Hanuu calls out to Laira, but she says, \"No. Red Lantern.\"</p>",

The GLC then proceeds to take down the person/people who committed the murders of Corps member's families.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/> <br/> </p><p>  ·       </p> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li>Guy, Kyle, Kilowog, and Salaak are staring into a vat filled with the eyeballs ripped from the family members of rookie Lanterns. They call Saarek in to join them in hopes that his ability to speak to the dead can help them identify the killer. </li> <li>Salaak expresses doubt over this supposed ability and Saarek acknowledges that he is aware that many Lanterns share these doubts. He has had this gift since he was a child and offers to prove his ability by aiding in this investigation. </li> <li>Saarek immerses himself into the tank; while in a trance-like state the eye cling around him until he is completely covered. With a scream the eyes all project the same image of a being and species unknown to all. </li> <li>Salaak has the image beamed to all rings with particular emphasis on those sectors protected by new recruits. While a plan is being formed a mob of angry rookies and some veterans are being confined from leaving their duties. They are scared for their relative’s lives and many express guilt over putting their loved ones in harms way. Salaak pleads with them to trust that a plan is in place, but their fears prompt each Lantern takes of their ring and resign rather then allow their family members to suffer because they are in the Corps. </li> <li>Later at Warriors Guy is charging his ring when a knock on the door disturbs him. Ice has come to Oa, having decided to start their date early. Guy is very happy but is immediately called to duty by Salaak. Ice agrees to stay behind and wait for him. Meanwhile Kyle is seen again drawing frightening images that foreshadow trouble for the Corps. </li> <li>In sector 1983 we find a rookie's parents speaking to a female alien wearing a Sinestro Corps uniform. The enemy is poised to kill the couple when Guy appears, blasting her across the room. Before he can take her into custody, the enemy kills herself with a blast to the head. Guy believes that the case is closed when Kilowog calls him from sectors away. </li> <li>Kilowog has fought and amputated the yellow ring from a twin of Guy's perpetrator, and has him in custody. The two Lanterns meet up along with Kyle and Saarek who \"reads\" Guy's dead suspect. These Sinestro Corps Soldiers are siblings calling themselves Quintet, and three more remain at large. </li> <li>With Saarek's knowledge, the final three are found by the Lanterns in the middle of plotting their next attack. They are easily defeated and taken to Oa where they are confined to the Sciencells. Guy leaves to join Ice, while Kilowog and Kyle thank Saarek and head to Warriors for a burger and beer. The Lanterns who resigned happily take back their rings and get back to duty at Salaak's suggestion. </li> <li>Saarek is summoned to see the Guardian known as Scar. She tells him that he is being sent on a secret mission which he is to discuss with no one, not even other Guardians. Scar wants Saarek is to use his gift to commune with the corpse of the Anti-Monitor. </li> </ul>",
