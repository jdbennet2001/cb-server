            "description": "<p><i>Fans have demanded it, the most unprecedented and horrifying night in American history continues as the next chapter of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is revealed at last! Hundreds of anti-war protestors have gathered at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1968. Behind them, a nervous National Guard stands at the ready, to maintain order should rioting erupt. And behind them, in the darkness, slithering out of the shadows with an insatiable hunger for human flesh, an army of the living dead is about to attack! As consciences, philosophies and emotions collide, the stories of several participants dove-tail into a single tale of survival against a foe much greater than anything they had previously fought against or imagined possible. But as the specter of the undead creeps increasingly closer to the White House, a simple miscalculation will spark a firestorm of murder, transforming an already tenuous situation into the most horrific bloodbath ever seen on American soil!</i></p>",

But the forces of Law are coming for them, and Law has no time for Pirates -- or Science. This historical science-fiction piratical romance by Warren Ellis is illustrated in Raulo Caceres' stunning woodcut style, and presented in full color. It is the time of Captain Swing and his Electrical Pirates, and history will never be the same. CAPTAIN SWING #3 is available with a Regular or Wraparound cover by series artist Raulo Caceres, and a special retailer incentive Penny Dreadful cover designed to look like a classic novel of yore.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The shocking all-new Lady Death on-going series continues as she begins her return to power! After successfully capturing one of five fragments of her stolen powers, forces beyond Illadra's understanding lure her to the darkest jungles of Asia in her quest to recover the lost heritage she once possessed as Lady Death! But horror awaits her on the open seas as the evil resonating from her recovered power crystal infects the crew of the ship she travels upon, an evil that twists them all into murderous, undead beasts with a taste for human flesh. But should she survive the voyage, can she possibly stand alone against the vile, supernaturally-twisted Fung Wei and his castle of torture, or the demonic Black Ghost Guards who defend their master? Co-written by Mike (Gravel, Wolfskin) Wolfer and original creator Brian Pulido, this series promises to be the most powerful Lady Death tale ever! Amazing new talent Marcelo Mueller provides the luscious art and Digikore brings the dramatic colors wrapped in a stunning new cover by Garrie (Supergod) Gastonny! Also available with a Wraparound cover by Juan Jose Ryp and a special Art Deco Retailer Order Incentive by painter Michael Dipascale!</i></p>",

In his ongoing campaign to convince his layabout, forty-something progeny to finally get his act together, Shizuo's father suggests a new approach: maybe Shizuo should just treat manga as a hobby and do something else--anything else--so as to look like less of a reject to both his family and society at large. Can Shizuo's burning desire to create manga triumph over his seemingly bottomless capacity for self-doubt and existential angst? Then again, maybe if Shizuo just comes up with a catchy pen name, everything will be golden and he'll quickly find himself on the merry road to publication. Right? </i>",

Harold Lorre carefully orchestrates the lives of those around him. To aid him in his twisted quest, and to satiate his twisted desires. Lorre might be the most evil man alive. Join us as Lapham and artist Raulo (Capt Swing) Caceres descend into a story about the worst aspects of human behavior, a tale of unspeakable evils, violent assaults on both mind and body, and of longing for death and the sweet release it will bring. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed. Crossed: Psychopath #3 is available with a Regular cover by Jacen Burrows, a Wraparound cover by series artist Raulo Caceres, a Torture cover by Matt Martin, and a special rare Red Crossed retailer incentive.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>FLASH QUESTION: Will The Flash and his new allies be able to fix the world?</i></p><p><i>Summary:</i></p><p><em>Flashpoint #3</em> starts in Detroit, with Cyborg asking President Obama for more time so he can assemble the Resistance and fight the Amazonians. The president declines to give him more time and tells Cyborg that their is a traitor among the resistance, and the president think it's the Outsider. The president says it's time for the U.S. military to finally intervene, that they can't just sit around and wait for the super-humans to save them. Element Woman is seen in the back listening to the conversation in fear.</p><p>In Wayne Manor, Gotham. Barry is \"mummy wrapped\" in bandages due to his failed attempted to recreate the scenario to become the Flash. Barry tries to try one more time, but Batman doesn't want him to because he has third degree burns on 75% of his body. Barry insists he doesn't want to forget, then a surge of new memories flash into his mind. He know remembers a bridge that leads to no where, the public reveal of Abin Sur, and dinner with his mom. He realizes he needs to move quicker before he forgets Thawne murdered his mother, his wife, and Bruce. Then Thomas helps him get to the roof for one more shot. Then the lightning bolt hits both Thomas and Barry sending Thomas flying towards the spires in his fence, and just at the last second Barry regains his power and saves Thomas from being impaled.</p><p>In New Themyscira, or what was the United Kingdom, Lois Lane is transmitting a message to Cyborg. She says that Aquaman is preparing an all-out attack tomorrow, and that will become the final battle. Then she hears Etrigan rhyme, then sees she has met up with the resistance.</p><p>In Wayne Manor, Thomas sees that Barry is recovering, and Barry decides to make his costume with the materials in the manor. Then they decide to find people they may need with Thomas' computer. Thomas and Barry rant about why doesn't Barry just go back and change everything, which Barry says he can't because he could topple dominoes like the butterfly effect. Flash tries to assemble the Justice League, but since Thawne reversed everything he also took them out of the equation. Barry has Thomas look for Superman, who's rocket hit metropolis and not the field near Smallville. They locate Cyborg who they think can locate Superman. Thomas agrees to join Cyborg's resistance if he chooses the team, and the next person is Superman, who Cyborg only knows where he is. Cyborg takes them to New Metropolis to find Project Superman who is in an underground facility two miles under Metropolis. Once they find the person who is supposed to be Superman, they find this weak, small, man who hasn't seen the sun. Then the security fires at Batman, Barry, and Cyborg. Project Superman then ditches them and flies away, leaving Barry, Cyborg and Batman pretty much to die.</p>",

But first he’ll have to protect himself from Sinestro, who having learned of the Flashpoint prophecy, is hell-bent on killing him. And with his power ring’s charge running out, what extremes will he have to go to in order to save the planet Earth from total destruction?</i> <br /> <br />Having severed Abin Sur's hand, Thaal Sinestro declares his intention to save reality, a plan that involves killing his fellow Green Lantern. With his willpower, Abin summons back his lost ring, along with a prosthetic energy hand. He proceeds to destroy Sinestro's power ring, and chaining him in his place. Abin plans to save Earth, and informs the Guardians about Sinestro's betrayal. When the Guardians find out that Abin has not yet retrieved the White Entity, and that Abin accuses them of feeling fear, they cut off his ring from the central battery, so that it will pass to a new Green Lantern of Sector 2814 once Abin's charge depletes.  <br /> <br />In England, Abin Sur joins Cyborg's fight against the Amazons and Atlanteans. When the same Geo-Force device that sank Europe activates again, threatening to sink the whole planet, Cyborg orders Abin to stop it. Abin tries, but his ring's charge depletes. Believing himself to be dead, Abin encounters his late sister Arin, who instructs him to embrace his destiny as the host of the White Entity of Life. She tells him to go save the Earth, and Abin is shown trying to stabilize the planet at the end.",

In the long-awaited issue 3 of the hit miniseries Fathom: Blue Descent, fans will finally learn exactly what Aspen’s beloved necklace is…and what it can do.

Seeing that a building is about to fall on them, Leonid makes a forcefield to protect himself, Tesla, Mina (the white lady) and Michelangelo. The rampaging Celestial proceeds to zap and destroy everything around it, and throws part of a building at the floating ‘Human Machine.’ Leonardo rallies some men to blast the Celestial but it emerges unscathed. Mina in her dove-form and Tesla attack and manage to bring it down. Looking around, the heroes recover Nostradamus from under some rubble, only to see the Celestial get up again and blast directly at them. Leonid shields them, while Stark and Richards operate a large weapon that shoots the Celestial in the chest, sadly to no effect. Michelangelo intervenes and communicates with the Celestial in Newton’s ‘Quiet Math’ language, at which the Celestial thinks to itself and then teleports into the future causing more buildings to collapse. Later, the assembled heroes gather around the Human Machine, ready to follow after Newton and the Celestial.</p>",

The 'rinse' is spiraling out of control for money launderer Jeff Sinclair - not only have his clients flown the coop, but he is also caught in the crosshairs of both IRS agent Della Dash and the menacing casino henchmen tracking down the stolen cash. Jeff only has three options left: get arrested, get killed... or pull off the biggest rinse of his life. A grounded, gritty look at the world of money laundering in the vein of Elmore Leonard, The Rinse is a modern crime classic in the making! Great for fans of Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips' Criminal!</i></p>",

Tensions are running high as the goddess Pandora and bayou swamp witch Anathema begin to unravel the mystery surrounding the horrific creatures which have invaded our dimension, but the enemy threat is about to reveal itself to be far worse than anyone could have imagined. A dark force from a parallel universe has possessed an innocent woman, transforming her into the fire-wielding Hellina and with the brain-washed and blood-thirsty Widow at her side, she has unleashed a reign of terror within one of Pandora’s prime business holdings, right in the heart of downtown Miami. With so many innocent lives on the line, Pandora’s options are narrowing to either hoping for some miraculous solution or killing every last person in the Promethea Building… Including her possessed allies! This epic saga is written by Mike (Lady Death) Wolfer and featured the art of Pow Rodrix wrapped in a stunning new cover by Matt Martin! Available with a Regular or Gore cover by Matt Martin, as well as a Wraparound and a special Art Nouveau Retailer Order Incentive by painter Michael Dipascale!</i></p>",

We've got a robot who's also a scientist. He fights monsters, sometimes Nazis, a mobile pyramid once, the planet Mars kinda, and also Stephen Hawking</i> <i>(though to be honest that was more of a metaphorical battle). His arch enemies include a brain in a jar, a time traveling dinosaur who isn't, and the spirit of Thomas Edison. Yeah, okay, this is the third issue in the sixth series, but it's still a great jumping on point. Check it: First issue Robo tried to rescue some astronauts. Second issue it all went horribly wrong. This issue Robo tracks down the true culprits! READ IT!</i></p>",

Unraveling this mystery is Hawkman's only chance to defeat Morphicius before he becomes unstoppable.</i></p><p>Carter returns to Professor Ziegler's lab, hoping to find more about Morphicius. Reaching the craft that contained Morphicius, Carter touches the symbols engraved on it. Suddenly, Carter's Nth metal begins reacting to the symbols. As the Nth metal armor manifests around Carter, the symbols reveals a hologram of a spaceship.</p><p>The hologram then reveals an alien that recognizes that Morphicius and his plague have been released. Apparently, Morphicius is related to a plague that caused devastation and suffering. The High Council sentenced Morphicus to forever roam space and time in the tomb. However, Morphicius has been freed and he must be stopped. The hologram says that Morphicius has a vulnerability, but the tomb explodes before the hologram can reveal it. Hawkman escapes from the explosion, realizing that Morphicius is vunerable to something he doesn't know yet. Also, Morphicius didn't escape, someone released him.</p><p>At N.L.A.S., Morphicius awakes before Kane, who introduces himself. Kane says that he is aware about the nature of the Xenusians and states that he will find a way to control Morphicius's power and take profit from it. Then, Askana begins to perform a vivisection on Morphicius.</p><p>The next morning, Carter goes to Emma's house, and she invites him a cup of coffee so that they can talk. He tells her that he went back to the lab to investigate about Morphicus. When Emma asks how can he translate alien symbols, Professor Ziegler comes in, saying that he learned not to ask too many questions when someone gets results. Carter tells the professor that someone freed Morphicus intentionally. Professor Ziegler tells him that the only man with unfettered access to the containment vessel was Terrence, and he trusts him with his life. When Carter asks Professor Ziegler where is Terrence, he replies that he hasn't seen him since yesterday at the hospital. He also says that he has been trying to phone him several times. Carter leaves, saying he is going to find Terrance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Terrance is getting into his car when he is attacked by a Xenusian creature. Suddenly, Hawkman takes the creature down and violently interrogates Terrance, wanting to know who is he working for. Terrance tells him that he will take him to Morphicius, and Hawkman carries him away.</p><p>At N.L.A.S., Askana has finished cutting Morphicius down. Kane tells Askana to freeze Morphicius's disembodied head, as it is the organism that thinks. Kane believes that the twelve organisms within Morphicius's cells can both heal and destroy. Suddenly, Morphicius' head laughs, and Kane tells Askana to get rid of him. Askana then transforms into a reptile.</p><p>Then, Hawkman and Terrance crash into Kane's lab. Terrance tells Hawkman that Kane is the one responsible, but Askana attacks Hawkman. After a short battle, Hawkman defeats Askana. Hawkman asks Askana where is Morphicius, and Askana replies that he probably escaped, and it's Hawkman fault. When Hawkman asks why, Askana replies that the man he brought with him was not a human, but one of Morphicius's plague.</p><p>Terrance is revealed to have been infected with Morphicius's plague. Then, he grabs Morphicius's head and merges it with his own body. Morphicius is fully reborn and prepares to battle Hawkman.</p><p>To be continued...</p>",

And he better do it quick. Lydia's party is in two hours and Allison's laid down an ultimatum--if he doesn't show up, their relationship is over. Jackson gets off on watching Scott's life crumble, but nothing motivates a teen-aged Werewolf like a hot girl threatening to break up with him.

            "description": "<p><i>The MARVEL MASTERWORKS are proud to present the continuing adventures of Col. Nick Fury in the Swinging Sixties! The irascible Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s series was a truly innovative lightning-in-a-bottle merger of comics and the spy craze of the day, and where better to start our collection than with a Nick Fury origin issue housed inside an iconic Jim Steranko cover? Next up: Steranko's last S.H.I.E.L.D. epic, 'Whatever Happened to Scorpio?,' will dazzle you before we launch into a new era of adventures including a moon-busting space mission, a mind-bending trip Fury may never come back from and a sub-earth battle with Supremus! Then, Nick Fury faces one of his oldest enemies in the Hate-Monger (a.k.a. Adolf Hitler); the British invade as Steve Parkhouse and Barry Windsor-Smith offer the one-shot 'Hell Hath No Fury;' and Hydra returns with its sights set on assassinating the S.H.I.E.L.D. director. It's a cliffhanger that will shock and surprise you! Also packed with cool covers from the Colonel's many S.H.I.E.L.D. reprint comics, and his appearance from MARVEL SPOTLIGHT #31, this Masterworks completes every fan's classic Nick Fury library! Collecting NICK FURY, AGENT OF S.H.I.E.L.D. #4-15, AVENGERS #72 and MARVEL SPOTLIGHT #31.</i></p>",

Melvin lands his first babysitting job only to discover he has his hands full, literally — the \"baby\" in this case is a giant-sized monster, almost the size of a room. Melvin meets his friend for a friendly game of marbles. An older monster-woman passing by is offended by the scene, as everybody in Monsterville knows that monsters should always fight when they're together. Finally, she is content only after forcing the two monsters into a scrap. Melvin also attempts to be the first kid in Monsterville to attend school in over 600 years, but he is thwarted each time by Miss McGargoyle, his would-be teacher. He is threatened with boulders, giant boomerangs, and even long-range missiles, but nothing can stop Melvin from wanting to go to school each day. Melvin Monster illustrates just how timeless the comics of John Stanley are.</em></p>",

Then finally, in “The Misty Isles” Valiant meets Aleta face to face but upon learning that she has had his crew killed (deservedly so, actually, but still), he flees in anger, vowing never to see her again.</i></p><p><i>“Homeward Bound,” Valiant continues his travels, with stops in Athens (where he meets the boisterous Viking Boltar, who will become his friend for life), North Africa, and Gaul (where Valiant liberates Gawain), before finally returning to Camelot. But his joyous return is short-lived as an alliance of Picts and Vikings threatens Britain’s security, and thus Valiant must journey forth with, as his ultimate destination, “The Roman Wall.”</i></p><p><i>The final pages of this volume boast a special feature: a gallery of images that were censored for being too sexy or violent (or subject to other editorial interference) prior to publication, plus another gruesome example of Foster's art being altered for publication, all with commentary by series editor Kim Thompson.</i></p>",

The brothers made the first controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight on 17 December 1903 and, in the two subsequent years, they developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed wing flight possible.</em></p>",

Considéré comme le dernier Templier, Vogel doit à la fois affronter la CIA et le Vatican qui semblent unir leurs efforts pour retrouver sa trace. De leur côté, Tess et l'agent Reilly, eux-mêmes inquiets des répercussions qu'entraîneraient de telles révélations, tentent de convaincre Vogel de mettre un terme à ses projets. Mais le professeur se trouve déjà en Turquie, où se situent les vestiges du navire templier chargé, il y a bien longtemps, de transporter les manuscrits. C'est donc dans cette région que serait dissimulée la dernière pièce de l'échiquier...</em></p>",
