Propelled by the rowing of a mysterious, skull-faced boatman, the berserker finds himself facing the end of his quest amidst the blood red waves.

            "description": "<p><em>You can't pick your parents. And if you could, Pixie certainly wouldn't have picked Mastermind, the man who turned Jean Grey into the Dark Phoenix. But right now, that's the least of her problems. A giant demon named Saturnine has been using her Pixie dust to lull her fellow X-Men into submission and it's worked. Now he's one step away from all the power he needs to take control of the world. Can the fast-talking Welsh girl with wings possibly stop him?</em></p><p>Saturnine's minions begin a battle with the X-Men at the abandoned school he had been using as his lair to trap Pixie and her friends Mercury, Armor and X-23. Regan Wyngarde and Martinique Jason are not happy that the X-Men are present. Meanwhile the demon nurse leaves the building carrying a large quantity of Pixie's dust but is confronted by Nightcrawler. The dust is released and knocks out Kurt and the nurse. Inside the building, Mercury, Armor and X-23 make their escape through a large pipe when X-23 breaks it open with her claws.</p><p>Saturnine speaks to Pixie and instructs her to take her mother's magic and bind it to her soul dagger. Pixie goes to her mother who tells her about her real father and that Regan and Martinique are her half sisters. Pixie punches the two ladies and takes out her dagger from inside her, ready to stab her mother. Emma approaches but Pixie knocks her to the ground. Drawing her dagger again, Mrs Gwynn casts a magic spell and it grows into a large sword. Pixie gives it to Saturnine who proceeds to use it to slaughter his demon minions. However, the magical sword will not work on non-demonic humans or mutants so he attempts to sheath it inside him (as is normal for soul-swords). Unfortunately for Saturnine it was only an illusion and he stabs himself to death through his chest. The girls Mercury, X-23 and Armor finally escape the school and bring a dazed Nightcrawler back to the others. When X-23 sees the Mastermind ladies she leaps into the attack, but Pixie magically teleports them away before it goes any further. Pixie apologizes to Emma Frost for punching her - but in order to convince Saturnine that she was still in his power and maintain the illusion spell she had to do it. Pixie talks to her mother, but struggles to accept that Mastermind is her real father. Mrs Gwynn grudgingly accepts that Pixie belongs with the X-Men and departs, leaving a surprised and saddened Pixie to rejoin her fellow mutants.</p>",

As they step through, they realize they're not in Kansas anymore.</i>Â <br />Â <br />In Georgetown, Boston Brand is teleported into a room which houses a sleeping unknown girl. She is awakened by his presence and turns into Dove aka Dawn Granger. She's shocked to actually see Boston Brand and mentions that he's not what she was expecting to see for the first time. She tells him that the Justice League has been looking for him and that they want to document him among the living. Hawk comes crashing in the room and attacks Deadman. Dove breaks up the fight and informs Hawk of her guest. Deadman begins to explain what he believes his purpose of life could be. Hawk informs him that he's got a job for him to do.Â <br />Â <br />In the Bermuda Triangle, a coast guard vessel is investigating some wreckage when out pops [someone] and attacks the ship.Â <br />Â <br />At Pittsburgh University, Ronnie Raymond is passed out on his bed from too much beer.

Scores will be settled in this extra-sized issue of AMERICAN VAMPIRE, with stories by author Scott Snyder and the master of horror himself, Stephen King.</i></p><p>âDouble Exposureâ. 1925. Pearl arrives at the Hollywood sign as arranged with B. D. Bloch. Bloch gives up Hattie and tells Pearl he plans to take her back to his home and find out what can harm her. A fight erupts on the hillside and Henry Preston comes to Pearlâs rescue in a car and they eventually make their escape. Suddenly, Hattie stabs Pearl in the back with a knife and reveals that she was the hooded figure from the first scene of the first issue. In the morning, Pearl is exhausted from the moonless night and is forced to feed on Prestonâs blood. Pearlâs situation begins to overwhelm her, but Preston says that she has to confront the European vampires and canât keep running away. Preston reveals that he is a marine and tells Pearl heâs with her on the fight against the old world vampires.</p><p>âOne Drop of Bloodâ. 1909. Book, Bunting, and Felix and Benita Camillo arrived at the devastated city of Lakeview. Bunting tells them his suspicions that Mr. Percy is a vampire, and must have infected Sweet, but he canât figure out why Sweet is unaffected in the sunlight. Jeeks and the Blackmouth Twins are still outside the mine shaft Sweet has been holed up in for two days and get ambushed by Book and Bunting.</p><p>Inside the shaft, Sweet notices his fangs are gone, his skin has become soft, and attributes it to the absence of the moon. Furious upon seeing his fatherâs severed head, Felix heads towards the mine shaft to avenge his father. Book follows. Sweet quickly kills Camillo and begins a fight with Book. Book strikes first by breaking Sweetâs arm. Sweet stuns Book with a rock, stands over him and drips blood into his eye before escaping further down the mine shaft. The shaft collapses with Sweet in it as everyone else escapes. Observing from afar, the old world vampires, after feeding on Jeeks and the Blackmouth Twins, leave assuming that Skinner is dead. Skinnerâs fate is unknown, but Book appears to have been turned into another American vampire.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The ten-issue vampire epic on the bayou from the writer of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels continues in issue four! From the New York Times Best-selling author, George R. R. Martin, comes a tale of vampire clans, death and debauchery, legendary blood masters, and even a few epic steamboat races on the muddy Mississippi. This is Martin's FEVRE DREAM, an antebellum story of power, loss, and the fever of bloodlust. Joshua York has given Abner Marsh more answers than he bargained for... but Marsh has been around a long time, and he knows something still isn't right. For one thing, York's newest guest, well, she ain't no lady. And the whispered accusations of the crew aren't very nice, but they are true: York never goes above deck in the daylight. But maybe Marsh's imagination is just getting the best of him. Surely a simple lunch with York should put all of his fears -- and those of the crew -- to rest, right? Each issue of this stunning full-color epic is illustrated by Rafa Lopez, an artist whose skilled line captures every moonlit drop of blood in delicious detail. Adapted by the Hugo-nominated author Daniel Abraham, this version of FEVRE DREAM stays faithful to Martin's original dark vision, while bringing the torture and joy of his vampires to almost-human life. This haunting series is available with Regular and Wraparound painted covers by Felipe Massafera and a very limited Nightmare retailer incentive.</i></p>",

SUPERGOD issue 4: The world is at war: or, more to the point, its chosen  and unleashed superhuman messiah figures are.  Are any of them still  human enough to realize they're going to bring about the end of life on  earth -- and do any of them care? This is what a superhuman arms race  would look like.  This is what asking to be saved by men who can fly  would look like.  Take every superhero comic ever published, shove them  into a nuclear-powered blender, soak it in bad vodka and set the whole  thing alight -- and SUPERGOD will crawl out and eat your brain!  This  five issue color series is drawn by Garrie Gastonny with colors by  Digikore.</i>",

Ellis and Wolfer, the writing team on Gravel, unveil the next six-issue barbaric epic of Wolfskin, this time joined by Gianluca Pagliarani, the star artist of Ignition City! Warriors of Ve, to arms! After vanquishing the giant, smoke-belching, iron-clad horror that crawled like a spider and vomited hordes of death-dealing warriors from its belly, Wolfskin and his mercenary crew of hired heroes barely have time to enjoy the benefits that their sword arms have earned them. Out of the blackness of the night, a new terror is descending upon the quiet, Northish village, but this mechanical wonder dwarfs the last, and it possesses a power never before seen by those on the peninsula of Thule or anywhere else in the ancient world. This creature, this vile machine is called Ã´The Mother Of The Black Beast.Ã¶ And it has the power of flight! This all-new, full-color six issue series is available with several historic covers. Series artist Pagliarani provides the Regular and Wraparound covers, maestro Felipe Massafera delivers the lush Painted cover, super-star artist Juan Jose Ryp serves up the violent Blood Thirst cover, and retailers are able to order a super-limited Bronze &amp; Blood edition.</i></p>",

Heâs having a damned hard time convincing the world that he does exist, that heâs been a brave soldier on the front lines of Americaâs secret wars for more than two decades. Now his former partner Domino is pointing a gun at Wilsonâs head on live TV, telling a panel of Senators that heâs full of [REDACTED]. But when the truth finally does emerge, the walls will come tumbling down and everybody will be caught in the crossfire just the way Deadpool likes it.

            "description": "<i>The biggest hit horror series of the year returns with an all-new seven-issue series written by David (Stray Bullets) Lapham! Adeline Pratt is a survivor. She is holding together what is left of her family while they are under constant siege. But as she has to face off against family members who have turned Crossed, can she bring herself to stay calm and in control? Or are the pressures of this horrific new World just too much for anyone to bare? What is the price of surviving in this new World, could it be that the only way to persevere is to be even more evil than the Crossed are? Imagine, for a moment, the worst crimes against humanity. Picture the cruelest affronts to decency. Conjure your darkest nightmares... and then realize it could all be so much worse. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed.</i><i><br /></i>",

With the Super Soldier Serum about to be sold on the black market, Steve Rogers must risk all to stop every terrorist nation on earth from creating armies of their own supermen.</i></p><p>In an airfield hangar, Myron Smith (Machinesmith in duisguise) starts the bidding for his Super-Serum at $100 million per vial. On the way to the hangar, Steve Rogers consults Beast on how to defeat Machinesmith. Beasts says it will be difficult because if you destroy his machine body, his consciousness will leap to the closest machine. Beast asks the robot Anita Erskine for help and she agrees, but her programming prevents her from harming Machinesmith. Beast has an idea and uploads it to Anita.</p><p>Back at the hangar, Anita gains entrance and smuggles Rogers in the trunk while a suspicious guard calls Machinesmith. He is alerted to Rogersâ presence and sheds the Myron Smith disguise. Rogers and Machinesmith battle as Machinesmith jumps from machine to machine and Rogers destroys devices as quickly as he can. Machinesmith transports back to his now decapitated robot head and realizes that Rogers and Anita have blocked satellite reception, cell towers, and destroyed every machine on the compound. Machinesmith jumps to Anitaâs body, but falls into their trap â Anita was willing to sacrifice herself by reconfiguring her system to allow wireless traffic in, but not out. Anita/Machinesmith then explodes.</p><p>Back at the Secret Avengersâ Roving HQ, Beast informs Rogers that the serum Machinesmith was trying to sell wasnât the Super-Soldier serum but instead a worthless liquid. Rogers wonders what the whole mission was really about. In Detroit, Aloysius Thorndrake and an alive and well Jacob Erskine (thought to be murdered in issue #1) reveal that Machinesmith was simply a sacrifice to get what they wanted â a sample of Rogersâ blood âfor comparisonâ. They drive past a 17 year-old boy and Erskine says that the boy has the exact same history as Rogers. They say âif the serum only works on Steve Rogers . . . then create more Steve Rogersesâ. Their ultimate plan is to create an army of Super-Soldiers . . . for the Shadow Council!</p>",

Storm is flying Jim Jaspers back to the town to get some medical assistance. She asks Beast and Wolverine to deal with the Furies, diplomatically if possible, but nonetheless contain them to the forest. Wolverine asks Beast if he should try diplomacy and he replies he has never seen Logan \"stab anyone diplomatically before.\" However, Henry adds that he is tired of having guns pointed at him. The furies start to scan Logan and Henry and declare them as an \"infestation\". The furies then begin to shoot Beast and Wolverine. They fight back Logan and Henry each kill a couple and then Wolverine is stabbed badly straight through his chest. When Beast attempts to help Logan he is shot down and is out of the fight. Logan is about to get up when the fury who stabbed him attempts to decapitate him. When that does not work it shoots several huge holes into him. Suddenly, Storm, Cyclops, Armor, Doctor Crocodile and his army, join the fray. Doctor Crocodile and Cyke each kill several furies.</p><p>The scene changes to Emma taking care of James Jaspers. She asks him to relax and let her probe his mind. Jim says the furies have come for him and that they will kill everyone.</p><p>The scene switches back to the battle. Cyclops orders Doctor Crocodile to keep his men back a while and Storm to attack the big fury with the arm regeneration with a one strike human lethal attack to see what they are up against.</p><p>The scene returns for a panel to Emma and Jim. Jim is still freaking out.</p>",

A long custody battle erupts, raising questions as to the importance of blood ties compared to a loving environment. Lavishly illustrated with Frank King's family photos, the book is elegantly designed by Chris Ware.</em></p>",

Americans, Germans, Friends, and Foes: all men are equal when faced with the terror that is Soldier John Doe. Only one man Lieutenant Thomas Brightwater - now fully aware of the horrifying truth of Doe's origins - seems willing to shift the course of a fate that may generate an even darker reality should shadowy imperial forces have their way. But buried deep in the bowels of an off the grid rural Sudanese military base, and facing off against a strike force determined to exterminate Doe at all costs, Lt. Brightwater and his only ally in Doe himself stand the slimmest chances at survival. War will never be the same.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Back in the spring of 2007, the world of Archie Comics was rocked by the publication of Betty &amp; Veronica Double Digest #151, featuring the first installment of \"Bad Boy Trouble,\" an epic tale that ran through issue #154 and found Riverdale's favorite teens rendered in a realistic style! Perhaps more than any \"new look\" story so far, \"My Father's Betrayal\" presents a very poignant situation. When Veronica and her friends vow to save a nature preserve from being turned into an industrial park, they discover the issue isn't as black and white as they think: not only will the industrial park bring much-needed jobs to the out-of-work residents of Riverdale, it will also help lower property taxes. But the biggest conflict of all? The industrial park is being funded by Veronica's father! Now every installment of this explosive tale is collected under one cover in this special edition.</em></p>",

Being the king of duncesâwhile still managing to avoid wearing the âcrownâ too oftenâtakes work, dedication, and an awful lot of imagination. It also takes a proper target: Leonie, the gifted girl who doesnât like to share her answers with His Majesty. Itâs a constant war of wits between these two, under the disbelieving eye of the long-suffering teacher, fought with wigs, cameras and magical pencil-sharpeners. And when schoolâs over, the beach is the new battlefield!</em></p>",
