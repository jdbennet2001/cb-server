Now a collector of magical and bizarre artifacts in the lower east side of New York, he's on a dangerous quest for four items that he thinks will keep a crazed Ancient Egyptian Priest from resurrection. This issue, the object is the Sword of Bone, and we finally discover the story of what really happened when Magik traveled to Ancient Egypt and met Storm's descendent during NEW MUTANTS #34 in a 22-page story by Louise Simonson and Steve Scott. Plus, Ian McNee comes face-to-face with the sword’s guardian in a special 10-page story by Marvel magic historian David Sexton and Eric Nguyen.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Super-powered criminals are being apprehended by a mysterious group of heroes. Someone is defacing Superhuman Registration posters. Someone is raising eyebrows all around town -- from City Hall to Tony Stark’s war chamber. And the only clue to their identity? Two spray-painted letters: N.W. Who are these mysterious young upstarts that have dared to fight the powers-that-be? And what do they want from a de-powered mutant named Sofia? Are the New Warriors truly back from the dead? Or has something new risen from the ashes of Stamford?</p><p><i>Synoposis</i></p><p>The Grey Gargoyle is on the run.</p><p>Two teammates communicate electronically with one member with a bird's eye view and the other ready to make his/her move on the ground level.</p><p>Wondra moves in on her prey and pounces on the criminal in a dark alley way. In a puff of purple smoke Wondra emerges towering over a now shrunken Grey Gargoyle, warning him to tell all his friends that, \"this is only the beginning\".</p><p>Elsewhere, Sofia Mantega roams freely in the clouds with the feathered wings of angel. As she moves past the sun she notices an ominous eye watching her from afar. Taken aback she sees the face of the Scarlet Witch, the woman who robbed the powers of 90% of the mutant population on the day now infamously known as M-Day. Sofia prepares to attack when Wanda's eyes glow with energy and fries Sofia, destroying her wings and forcing her to plummet to the ground.</p><p>Sofia awakens to an audience of curious eyes on a subway train. The traumatic event was only a nightmare yet the reality of her lost powers remains. Sofia leaves the subway and walks through New York City, taking time to notice an Uncle Sam-like poster of Iron Man promoting the Superhuman Registration Act. She looks angrily at the picture and walks away. She later meets with an old, homeless man named Sammy whom she had been visiting nearly every day. She offers him to come down to her diner to get some food.</p><p>*Sammy: <b>\"You're my guardian angel, you know that?</b>.\"*</p><p>Sammy reveals that someone had given him some money to deliver a cell phone to Sofia. On the cell phone is an ominous message for Sofia to continue her path while he taps into her MP3 player. The man just talks and hardly lets Sofia get a word in. He knows that she is a depowered mutant and that while she has tried to move on with her life, she is still very lost. He abruptly ends the conversation, greatly aggravating Sofia.</p><p>Nearby, Detective Givens and Detective Sykes find a miniature Grey Gargoyle taped to a lamp post. The two detectives, who work for the super-powered division of the NYPD in association with S.H.I.E.L.D., find a note attached to the tiny villain that reads \"NW\".</p><p>The detectives try to figure out theories as to how the Grey Gargoyle was captured, but they come up with nothing. Givens begins to move away the scraps of garbage on the ground to uncover a graffiti message on the pavement that says, \"the New Warriors were here\".</p><p>In a diner not too far away, Tony Stark's voice can be heard from a small television screen. Several customers have their eyes glued to the screen as Stark discusses a dangerous new group of vigilantes. Two men debate Tony Stark's methods for safety as Sofia walks in for work.</p><p>Sofia's boss proclaims she's late and that she's not taking the job seriously. She sasses her boss in front of the other workers and somehow her charm keeps her in her job.</p><p>One of her other co-workers, a rather large woman named Tina, tells her that her \"boyfriend\" Barry is sitting at another table waiting for her. The man had been visiting the diner for the past month and Tina suspects that he probably has an innocent crush on her.</p><p>Sofia approaches him to take his order and the two flirt and set up a date for later that night.</p><p>Later that night in Sofia's apartment as she readies for her date, a message pops up on her computer screen. The man continues to try to recruit Sofia into their cause and Sofia figures out that whoever they are they must be affiliated with the new vigilante group that are currently being hunted by the Initiative. The man tells her to break her date, but Sofia angrily protests as she had finally gotten her life back on track after losing her powers. However, the man knows that its still not what she wants. He knows that she wants something more.</p><p>Elsewhere Captain America villain Anaconda is found tied up to a lamp post by Detective Sykes and Givens. Anaconda seems to be wrapped in Spider-Man's webbing, but the true nature of her capture doesn't seem to be all that it seems.</p><p>Later that night Sofia waits to meet the man from the New Warriors. Instead, she sees Barry despite canceling their date. He asks her to come with her, but upon realizing he has something to do with the messages she slaps him across his face and prepares to leave.</p><p>Barry reveals to Sofia that they had actually known each other all along, dating back to their time with the Xavier Institute. He tells Sofia that Barry is actually short for \"Barnell Bohusk\", also known as the former mutant Beak. The two embrace and try to catch up on old times, but Barry insists on explaining what the New Warriors are about. He opens a portal and the two teleport to a large, metal building. The teleportation leaves Sofia rather woozy, but before she can regain her composure she is greeted by a man long thought dead--Night Thrasher!</p><p>Homagecover to Uncanny X-men vol.1 issue 141</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Marvel's massive summer smashfest begins! Exiled by a group of Marvel \"heroes\" to the savage alien planet of Sakaar, the Hulk raged, bled and conquered through the pages of last year's \"Planet Hulk\" epic, rising from slave to gladiator to king. Now the Hulk returns to Earth to wreak his terrible vengeance on Iron Man, Reed Richards, Dr. Strange and Black Bolt -- and anyone else who gets in his way. Stronger than ever, accompanied by his monstrous Warbound gladiator allies, and possessed by the fiercest and purest rage imaginable, the Hulk may just tear this stupid planet in half. The epic story of anger unbound begins with this special double-sized issue written by \"Planet Hulk\" scribe Greg Pak and penciled by the legendary John Romita, Jr.</em></p><p>Hulk and his Warbound arrive. First stop is the moon. As Hulk lands, he is met by Black Bolt and Medusa. She questions why he has arrived unannounced. They see he is dressed for war. She says he has faced Black Bolt before and lost. All Hulk can say is, \"You shot me into space...Killed my world...\" Medusa tells him to stop and he says \"Never.\" As he approaches, Black Bolt simply whispers, \"Enough.\" The force of his words blasts Hulk. He fights to hang on but is eventually sent flying back. They turn to head back towards their palace. Hulk comes back saying he hasn't come there for a whisper. He wants to hear Black Bolt scream and jumps towards him.</p><p>On Earth, the arrival of the Hulk's ship has been detected. They've registered that there's been an explosion on the moon. Tony Stark tries telling the President to block all the satellites but it is too late. The ship can be seen over New York City. A giant holographic message appears before everyone and on all channels. Hulk tells the \"puny humans\" that he has come to smash. He wants them to know why first. He shows them the message from Iron Man, Reed Richards, Black Bolt, and Dr. Strange about sending him into space. He tells everyone how he was sent to a planet where he could be killed and was forced to become a gladiator. He tells them about his Warbound and how he became King and had a Queen. He shows them how a bomb was sent with him and destroyed his planet and killed a million people. He gives New York City 24 hours to evacuate. He says that after that time if he does not see Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic, and Dr. Strange, he will smash the entire planet and shows the beaten pulp of Black Bolt.</p><p>Iron Man takes off. He takes over the satellites mainframes and sets them up so that Hulk cannot tap into them again. As soon as Iron Man has locked into the satellites, they hit him with a modified EMP blast through them. Doctor Strange's astral form appears before Iron Man. He mentions that Hulk's never been angrier or stronger. Iron Man asks Strange to use his magic to send him away. Dr. Strange questions that action as it would most likely result in Hulk destroying another world. They caused the problem and must solve it. He asks Tony if he wants the help of his \"comrades\" if he can resist in trying to arrest them. Stark says all unregistered heroes will get a full pardon if they turn themselves over when all of this is over. Strange says that'd be something if they could survive the Hulk's anger.</p><p>Stark and Reed Richards pay a visit to Sentry. They tell him that they need him to go to the Hulk. Robert is hesitant because they are friends. He says the last time he saw the Hulk, he was fighting the Void and got every bone in his body broke. Then he found out he was the Void. Reed tells him that he is the most powerful being in the universe and they need him, the Hulk needs him.</p><p>In Manhattan, S.H.I.E.L.D. and other assorted heroes (including Spider-Man and She-Hulk) assist in evacuating everyone. Finally they've managed to evacuate five million people in twenty-three hours. A fire chief asks Spider-Man and Ms. Marvel what is the big deal, the Hulk's been dealt with before. Ms. Marvel mentions that he's different now, especially since he smashed Black Bolt. The chief doesn't know who Black Bolt is. Spider-Man mentions that before this, he thought Black Bolt was the \"second most powerful guy in the galaxy.\" The chief says that he must be number three now.</p><p>A figure is seen flying towards them and they think it's Sentry. It turns out to be Iron Man in a huge piece of armor. Spider-Man's senses go off like crazy as Hulk's ship can be seen floating overhead. Iron Man tells them that this is his fight. He tells them not to attack until he is done with him or the Hulk is done with him. Flying towards Hulk, Hulk jumps down to meet him. The impact sends a shockwave that knocks most off their feet and smashes the windows on the surrounding buildings.</p><p>As they are engaged, Iron Man sends out a transmission. He tells everyone that he is to blame for the Hulk's anger. He says that everything he'll ever do is to protect the world. Iron Man gives Hulk a punch that sends him flying miles away. It looks like Iron Man has won as everyone cheers and thinks the fight is over (except for Rick Jones). Iron Man continues his transmission, telling the world that he has injected the Hulk with nanobots that were made to suppress his powers. As Hulk slowly tries to get up, Iron Man flies up and authorizes an air strike against the Hulk. Missles fly towards him and explode in a huge blast. Hulk yells out Caiera's name and recalls his time with her, her news that she was pregnant with his child, the explosion of the warp core that destroyed everyone. Fresh with the memory that they've killed her, his anger is renewed.</p><p>Hulk jumps up and smashes into Iron Man in the air. They land in Stark Tower and Hulk continues to smash him. The heroes look on as they see Stark Tower begin to crumble. Iron Man tries to fight back with his repulsor blasts as the building ends up a pile of rubble. The heroes rush over only to find an angry Hulk emerging from the destruction, standing over what's left of Iron Man.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The next sci-fi epic blasts off here! In the grim aftermath of the Annihilation War, a devastated universe struggles to rebuild. Gripped by fear and paranoia, civilizations have collapsed and entire worlds are now smoking ruins. What’s next for the battle-weary heroes known as Nova, Peter Quill and Quasar (Phyla)? What are Ronan’s plans for the once-mighty Kree Empire? Which</p><p>cosmic characters of the past are about to return? Who is the new hero approaching on the horizon? And what is the new threat that no one suspects? Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, the acclaimed writing duo that brought you Annihilation Nova, unite with rising star Mike Perkins (Captain America, Union Jack) and cover artist Aleksi Briclot (World of Warcraft) to light the fuse on the next saga that will blast the universe wide open!</p><p>A group of mercenaries stands outside the temple of the Priests of Pama, a pacifist organization on an outworld planet. Balking at the requests of the robed monks for them to leave, one of the monks reveals herself to be Phyla-Vell, the new Quasar. As she identifies the temple as being under her protection, the band of mercinaries attacks. Using the Quantum-bands she stole from Annihilus, Phyla rushes into battle. As she is fighting she hears a strange voice in her head as Moondragon jumps in to assist. The pair make waste of the would-be pillagers quickly, and Quasar thanks Moondragon for the assist.</p><p>Heading back into the temple she informs the monk, to his surprise, that the mercenaries are to be taken in and given shelter and provisions. Times are hard and violent for many planets in the wake of the Annihilation wave and she would rather educate the misfortunate rather than condemn them for the crimes which they commit out of desperation.</p><p>Back in the temple Phyla confides in Moondragon that she is no where near experienced enough with the Quantum-Bands. The wielder must posses immense concentration and imagination. She also worries that despite all of her training she could never live up to the legacy of her father or brother, the first and second Captain Marvel. Phyla also mentions to Heather that she is concerned that they are wasting their potential assisting such small and depopulated outworld planets. Moondragon responds that their work is necessary for the rebuilding of the Kree empire as Hala and the Heartworld planets are being overseen by Ronan himself.</p><p>Meanwhile Peter Quill is on Hala working to repair the holes in Kree defenses made during the Annihilation. He describes his plans to Nova during a holo-communication on his way to greet a group of Galadorian space knights who's software may be able to upgrade the entire Kree defensive network, the only major defensive network left in the quadrant after the Annihilation. The Galadorians upload their software updates and a fleet of Kree Sentrys launch for a test demonstration watched by Ronin himself.</p><p>While Phyla is meditating she is interrupted by a strange voice in her head once more informing her that there is a great danger to her and that she is the only one that can find the one to prevent a great threat to the Kree. As she is describing what happened to Moondragon a rogue Kree Sentry destroys the wall of the temple. Phyla is able to take out the Sentry with a shockwave from the Quantum-bands targeted at the rogue machine.</p><p>Above Hala the Kree Sentrys begin scrambling over an intruder that doesn't exist and even take out a Kree ship in orbit around the planet. There is an incompatibility between the network and the programming that was just uploaded. The Galadorians inform him that there was not programming incompatibility before turning on him and commencing fire upon the Kree guards. Looking into the head Galadorian's eyes he sees a strange machinery. He then looks up to see all of the Kree sentrys flying overhead with the same mechanical infection.</p><p>After ravaging the city with destruction the Sentrys begin massing together over the city's main power generator and even begin fusing together into a tower-something that the Kree technology in the sentrys shouldn't even be able to do. The tower sends out a massive surge of energy that tears straight through a Kree destroyer and catches the attention of Phyla and Moondragon. Following the ripples caused by the energy surge Phyla finds a wall of energy that is surrounding all of Kree space. The Quantum-bands tell her that whatever is causing this energy dome has put the entire area of space out of phase with the rest of the universe so that nothing can get in or out--something that not even Galactus has the power to do.</p><p>On Hala the same t-o infection that took over the Galadorians begins to spread to all of the Kree on the planet as well. Peter Quill is pleased to see that the Kree under his command are coming back to help him, however they are revealed to have caught to the same mystery infection as everything else. As creatures begin to come free of the Kree sentry tower a voice booms to the people of Hala that they will not be harmed so long as they submit and that rather than conquest they seek to preserve the future of the Kree. The figure identifies itself as the return of the Phalanx and that it has finally completed its conquest.</p><p><strong><em>The Phalanx Has Returned!</em></strong></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Find out how Spider-Man's super hero career began in a fully-painted recounting of the origin of the original hard-luck hero.</em></p><p>In MYTHOS: SPIDER-MAN, the classic origin is revisited once again. Written by Paul Jenkins with pencils by Paolo Rivera, this new take on the story gives a reimagining of how Spider-Man came into being. Using elements from all over Spidey's long history, the story is a fresh look at how Peter Parker became the Amazing Spider-Man.</p><p>In MYTHOS, we'll see some of the characters that are just as important as the wall crawler himself. Friends like Mary Jane and Harry Osborn fill the halls at Midtown High and Aunt May and Uncle Ben offer their love and sage advice. Just as in the original telling, Uncle Ben regales to Peter the one principle that Peter would base his entire crime fighting life on--with great power comes great responsibility. In all versions of Spider-Man's genesis, this one piece of fatherly influence has been what makes Peter Parker a better man and a better hero.</p><p>With some familiar elements and some you may not expect, MYTHOS will remind you of just who Peter Parker is, and why after 45 years we are still captivated by a web slinging hero who has just as many problems as we do.</p><p>Relive the birth of a hero in MYTHOS: SPIDER-MAN by Paul Jenkins and Paolo Rivera</p><p>School is rough for Peter Parker. The students ignore him while he is there. He leaves and no one even notices. Back at home Aunt May prepares a plate of wheat pancakes for her nephew. As Peter just stares at his food Uncle Ben asks him what is wrong. Peter comments on the food and Uncle Ben says he wasn't talking about the food. Peter comments about how rough school is for him, and the bully named Flash Thompson. Uncle Ben tries to comfort Peter by telling him that Flash is really scared of Peter's intellect and high grades, then says a variation on Spider-Man's famous advice: \"If you have power, then you have responsibility.\"</p><p>Later Peter and his class attend a scientific demonstration on ionized radiation. While Peter is asking questions on the effects of the ionized radiation a spider wanders though the radioactive beam becoming infused with radiation, lands on Peter's hand, and gives him a bite. Peter staggers out of the building and notices that the bite wound on his hand is glowing. He wanders across a street right in the path of a speeding car. The car blares its horn and before Peter knows what is going on he finds himself on a fire escape two stories up.</p><p>The next morning Aunt May and Uncle Ben are looking for Peter to help him get ready for school but he is nowhere to be found. Peter is blocks away in a bike helmet and pads spinning webs and swinging from building to building. He discovers that he has the proportional strength and speed of a spider, clear vision, and the ability to walk on walls along with his ability to spin webs from his hands. He then dwells on a way to use his new abilities to make money.</p><p>Creating a Spider-Man costume for himself he locates a manager and gets bookings on a variety of Television shows. While collecting his cut from the taping of a late-nite tv show he sees a man running through the parking structure carrying a purse and a pearl necklace. The man runs past Peter and he doesn't even try to stop him. The security guard asks why he didn't even try and Peter responds that they haven't been there for him all those years, so why should he be there for them.</p><p>Costumed, Peter swings home where his Aunt May and Uncle Ben have been wondering where he has been getting all of his money. At home he is greeted by police officers at his front door. The cop tells him that with all of the money lying around the house there was a break-in and his Uncle was shot and killed. Hurt and angry peter suits back up and swings across the city to an abandoned warehouse where the criminal is holding up. He wrestles the criminal to the floor and recognizes his face from the parking structure earlier. Enraged Peter drags the criminal up the side of the building telling him that he should have killed him when he had the chance. Peter holds the thug over the side of the building threatening to kill him while asking him to tell him that he has all the power. When the thug agrees and says it peter tells him that he should kill him right then, but he has a responsibility even to him. Peter leaves the criminal wrapped in webbing from a light-post for the cops to find. Later comes his Uncle's funeral and a period of mourning. Spider-Man is born.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The Summer Event of 2007 begins here! Top Cow Productions is proud to present a sneak preview of First Born, the highly anticipated three issue limited series debuting in July. Buzz has been steadily building for Top Cow's first comic event in years since it was first announced in Wizard Magazine's 2007 Preview Issue in January.</p><p>This First Look introduces new fans to the story leading into First Born as well as an exclusive early look at the event itself. </p><p><em>Witchblade Recap</em></p><p>Sara Pezzini was the daughter of a New York City police officer. She followed in her father's footsteps and during an undercover investigation one night, stumbled upon the Witchblade and became its latest bearer. The artifact with enormous destructive potential and Sara has had to wrestle against it time and again. The Witchblade is the male offspring of two forces of the universe, The Angelus and The Darkness. After learning about the Witchblade, Sara remained a cop and started taking on the cases that were too weird or were deemed unsolvable. That all ended when she became pregnant. The pregnancy was unexpected and impossible because Sara hadn't had sex in more than a year. Nevertheless she decided to keep the child. To assure its safety she passed on the Witchblade to Danielle Baptiste and took time off work. Some of her allies include Detective Patrick Gleason (her lover), Patience (the current Magdalena), and Jackie Estacado (current wielder of The Darkness). Their common enemy is the Angelus. Though currently without a host, the agents of the Angelus are still completing their masters work. </p><p><em>The Darkness (partial story)</em></p><p>The Butcher is torturing a member of an Armenian gang that has been moving into Franchetti territory. Butch tries to get something out of him but even removing teeth fails to provide any information. Jackie comes from the shadows and starts his own interrogation. He first talks kindly with the man, but when he receives nothing but insults in return, it's time to stop being gentle. Jackie turns out the lights and starts to terrify the man with his creatures. The man screams in fear and seems ready to talk, but before he can, the roof of the building is torn open and Angelus pour in. </p><p><em>Sketchbook</em></p><p>The last couple pages are filled with sketches and art made by Stjepan Sejic.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Superstar writer Paul Dini (52, Lost) makes an explosive return to Top Cow in 2007 when he brings brand new character Madame Mirage to the Top Cow!</p><p>But who is this beautiful woman who appears out of the mist? As deadly as she is beautiful, she is cutting a bloody path through the city's villains, who now wear suits and have \"legitimate\" businesses. But who is her ultimate prey? And how does this Mirage take form? And why is her destiny and that of her sidekick Harper so irrevocably entwined? These and many other questions will be asked along with the most pivotal question of all – Who is Madame Mirage?</p><p>Dini weaves a tale of murder, intrigue and revenge in a world of high-tech espionage and treachery. Joining Dini is rising artistic star, Kenneth Rocafort (Hunter-Killer) with his atmospheric and kinetic style. The first issue features two covers by sensual cover artist Greg Horn (Superman Returns, She-Hulk) as well as a stunning cover by series artist Rocafort. Madame Mirage – you'll never forget her… if you can make her acquaintance and live to tell the tale. Oversized first issue featuring bonus additional pages of story and art!</p><p>Around the turn of the twenty-first century mankind got one of its greatest wishes--bio-engineering and cybernetic technology advances have allowed mankind to create individuals who have strength and power that normal people could only dream about.  These powers allow a dedicated few to work for the betterment of mankind and the salvation of its people.  These wonderful turns of events come with a price.  Why work hard to better the living condition of so many when it is so much easier to use such gifts to victimize the general population?  With a rise of heroes came a surge of similarly augmented people intending to break, loot, seal, and kill anyone that stands in their way.  A world protected by their advanced saviors was now ripe for the taking by those who wished it harm.</p><p>With super-powered villains numbering far greater than those willing to serve and protect a global treaty was enacted banning such living weapons.  Those twisted scientists and high-powered criminals that could escape persecution hid out from capture and went underground.  In an ironic twist those who chose to use their powers to help their fellow man turned themselves in peacefully--and paid the price for their admirable goals when they faced hard time in prison.  Most of them would quietly serve their time and then slip out into anonymity.</p><p>Many of the super-criminals that haunted the world would band together, pooling their resources.  These vast resources allowed the conglomerates that they formed to bribe as they pleased, securing high power in industry.  Their enhanced skills were still used under the table, contracted to the highest bidder.</p><p>This brings us to the present--Los Angeles.  Former super-criminal come hit-man for hire Vinnie (the Hummingbird) removes his cloak revealing a high tech apparatus strapped to his back and jet-engines boost him high above the city streets.  His flight and first mission within the organization that employes him will come to an abrupt and premature end as a tall, dark woman clad in a white dress, black stockings, and black hat would take aim and fire two shots directly into his jet pack.</p><p>Vinnie's death of the explosion would make headlines in the next morning's newspaper.  Senior members of Aggressive Solutions International would now debate what, if any ties remained to Vinnie.  One in particular, Roger Maitland, would use this event to plot his early retirement.  With a briefcase full of ten million dollars and millions stolen from the corporation over the years in offshore accounts Roger decides to make his move.  As he is leaving the office for a dinner meeting a paranoid Roger sees everything that is said to him on the way out as out of the ordinary--from his secretary to the man next to him in the elevator.</p><p>At the grill Roger meets his girlfriend April who he tells about the week long business trip that he is planning in Europe and the two go separate ways.  A large man grabs April and feigns knowing her and brings her in close.  As the human mountain is about to make his move a woman jumps out of the stall next to them and firs three shots at point-blank range into his back.  With the towering man stunned and on the ground she grabs April and the two sneak into a secret room behind a broken mirror to see the same woman that had secretly killed the Hummingbird the night before.  They explain that the large, blond man was under Roger's employ and was paid ten thousand to kill her.  To prevent her from getting into more trouble her saviors knock her unconscious, and put her in a taxi destined for her home.</p><p>Roger gets back into his limo to realize that his driver has been replaced with the shadowy woman and he has no way out.  Speeding through the LA streets she explains her detailed knowledge of everything that A.S.I. is responsible, that she is responsible for the death of their newest recruit, and that earlier that afternoon she played the role of both his secretary and the man in the elevator at A.S.I. headquarters.  A frightened Roger attempts to bribe her with a the suitcase of money, which she tells him is sadly a buck and a half short of her asking price.  As Roger pleads for his life she disappears into a wisp of smoke and the limousine flies head-on into the jet that was supposed to carry Roger to his peaceful future in Europe.  The authorities that were chasing the speeding limo get out of their cares to see the shadowy woman blow them a kiss and then disappear into the flames of the wreckage.  What is left of her is a pair of stylized, burning, nested M's on the ground.</p><p>The next day the Dude, the hitman Roger Maitland hired to kill his girlfriend was released early by the hospital due to a lack of any real tissue damage by the bullets.  Back at A.S.I. headquarters he explains what happened to his superiors who know that Roger was siphoning money from them all along.  When he removes his jacket they notice a disk that a nurse at the hospital had slipped onto him.  They play the disk and the shadowy woman introduces herself as Madame Mirage, and explains what she has done so far and that no one within the corporation is safe from her before disappearing into a cloud of smoke again.  The man she addressed on tape is now forced to go tell the other board members that they all now have a problem.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>When the Illuminati voted to shoot the Hulk into space, Professor X wasn't there...but the Hulk just found out he was supposed to be. So he shows up at the Xavier Institute to ask a few pointed questions, Hulk style. With the other teams away, only Beast and the New X-Men stand between the massive rage of the Hulk and the Professor...not to mention the younger students who'd be caught in the crossfire. Can the X-Men-in-training survive the wrath of the Jade Giant until the other X-teams get back? Or will the young mutants become casualties of the World War Hulk?</i></p> <p>A little while ago, Tony Stark and Professor Xavier met to update each other. Charles informs him that Havok and Polaris and with the Starjammers and will send along information about the Shi'Ar Empire. Stark asks him if he could ask Havok to keep an eye out for the Hulk while he's out in space. Charles doesn't know why he'd run into the Hulk. Stark tells they voted to send Hulk off planet after he went on a rampage in Las Vegas. They know that he didn't end up on the uninhabited planet they intended him to land on. Since Namor voted against the idea, Tony asks Charles how he would've voted had he been there.</p> <p>Today, at the Xavier Institute, Charles is in the subbasement using Cerebra to see if he can locate any new mutants. Since M Day, there hasn't been a single new mutant. Up above, Beast is having a training session with the students in the living room. He tells them that if and when they get in a battle, there will be civilians they need to be aware of. They need to be able to fight in different environments. Suddenly they feel a tremble and notice that the O.N.E. sentinels are taking off. Since they're job is to watch over the mutants at Xavier's, they wonder what emergency could have called them away. Hank turns on the television to see if there is a news reportwhen she sees the Hulk's message for all of New York City to evacuate within twenty-four hours. Hellion feels they should rush over there to take on the Hulk while Mercury says too many civilians could get hurt and they should help evacuate them.</p> <p>There is another tremble and Hank rushes to the window. He is shocked to see that Hulk has arrived on their doorstep demanding to see Xavier. Prodigy and Elixir rush in to see if Hank knows that Hulk is there. Hank tells them to get the other students out through the Morlock tunnels and to tell the Professor what is going on. Rockslide is excited to be able to fight the Hulk. Beast tells him it's not something to wish for but they need to buy time for the other mutant students to escape.</p> <p>Beast answers the door as Hulk has been gracious enough to wait outside for Xavier. Beast tells Hulk that Xavier can't come and when Hulk says he'll find him himself, Hank once again says he can't allow that either. Hulk knocks Hank away and tells him that he wasn't asking for permission. The other students take this as their cue to attack.</p> <p>They manage to knock Hulk outside. Hulk tells Beast he has two seconds to get the kids off of him or whatever happens to them in on Hank's shoulders. Beast takes Elixir over to Hulk telling him to use his death touch on him. Elixir is hesitant because he doesn't want to kill him. Hank tells him he'd probably get a medal if he did. Hank asks Hulk if he understands what the touch did to him. He says it just made him madder. He grabs a statue and smashes it at them. He claps his hands to make a sonic boom to try to rupture Hellion's eardrums so he can't use his telekinesis. Dust tries to attack him but Hulk just grabs a water pipe from the ground and squirts her away. Hank tries attacking again only to get another punch. Now it's Rockslide's turn. Hulk seems to know that he is the one that can control his body when it's in pieces. First he rips off both his arms. Then forcing him down with his foot, he rips off both his legs. He tosses them back and asks if he can still control them if they land in Connecticut. </p> <p>Hulk asks whose turn is it to get hurt next. X-23 just sees him as a target and rushes at him. Hulk asks if she's Wolverine's sidekick and grabs both her arms in one hand. X-23 uses a claw in her foot and slashes Hulk in the eyes. Surge blasts him and Beast and X-23 both start hitting and slashing him. Hulk knocks them all away saying that his eyes just grew back so that means his healing factor is back to normal (after Elixir's touch). He throws X-23 through the school's wall saying he hopes she heals like Wolverine does. He tells them that he didn't want it to be like this. He just wanted Xavier.</p> <p>As Hulk looms over Hank and Elixir, he feels pain at his back. Wolverine, Cyclops, Colossus, Kitty Pryde (and Lockheed), and Emma Frost have arrived. Despite having blood pouring from his back, he seems to be happy saying that this is the fight he was expecting. Xavier appears in the doorway telling Hulk that they will not fight. Now that the students are safely away, he has come to him. Hulk notices that Xavier is walking again and says that he can \"fix\" that. Charles uses his powers to mentally stop Hulk. He is surprised at how fierce Hulk's mind has become. He experiences feedback and sees Hulk's experiences on Sakaar. He sees how he was a slave and gladiator. He sees that Hulk found happiness with a wife and child on the way. He sees the destruction and death of so many, including his wife and unborn child. </p> <p>Beast was able to \"see\" all this too. Charles tries talking to Hulk. He says that the others did send him into space but they wouldn't have sent the bomb with him to destroy everything. He says that he knows that. He was able to beat some information out of Black Bolt and knows that Xavier was supposed to be there with them when they made their decision. He wants to know how he would have voted on the destruction of his life.</p>",

Maybe the Decepticons and Dr. Doom know! War is about to break out on the border between Latveria and Symkaria -- unless two unique teams of heroes can unravel a dark mystery… that is, if they don’t destroy each other first! Stuart Moore (WOLVERINE, PUNISHER X-MAS SPECIAL) and Tyler Kirkham (X-MEN: PHOENIX WARSONG) bring together fan-faves like Wolverine, Megatron, Spider-Man and Optimus Prime in this all-new, four-issue, widescreen adventure!</p><p>Avengers Captain America, Luke Cage, Wolverine and Spider-Man are in Latveria investigating a radiation signature that SHIELD thinks is coming from something Dr. Doom is doing. Clearing a hill the team comes across a strange dome covered in energy and broken Doombots scattered around its base. Maria Hill tells them over a communicator that the dome doesn't match Doom's technology, but that since it's probably connected to the rising hostilities in nearby, they should check it out anyway. Wolverine and Luke get closer and break a hole in the dome and Captain America gets mad at them for not waiting his orders. Everyone gets a little mad, but they proceed into the base. They enter a corridor and are welcomed by strange reflective walls and a barrage of lasers. As a laser hits each hero, a voice somewhere else monitors data collected by the attack. When Spider-Man gets tagged the voice says that he's \"perfect\" right before Spider-Man gets electrocuted and then taken away by a car. Wolverine gets mad and tries to cut his way out but finds himself facing a force field. Captain America, Wolverine and Luke all start yelling at each other and mysterious machines monitor them from elsewhere.</p><p>The machines, called Autobots, realize what is going on. Their enemy Megatron is broadcasting an \"aggression wave\" that makes causes all nearby humans to act violently. The countries that Maria had mentioned earlier were going to war because of this aggression wave and now the Avengers were going for each other's throats. The purpose of the wave was to make humans kill themselves leaving the planet open to Megatron. With this information, Optimus Prime decides to do something.</p><p>In the dome, Megatron has Spider-Man on what looks like an operating table. He says that Spider-Man will help him in his greatest triumph, but he doesn't tell him how.</p><p>At the force field, Captain America greets Ms. Marvel and Falcon as they land to provide backup. The team starts to fight once again, but before things go too far, the Autobots arrive. Optimus tells the Avengers to leave, but in response, Captain America leads his team in an attack.</p>",

The League of Assassins tracks Black Canary to Star City in an effort to liberate the child, Sin, they believe to be the DCU's next greatest assassin. Luckily, Black Canary has other plans for Sin's abilities and future.<br/></p><p>While at a fast food joint with Sin, Black Canary recounts her first meeting with the Green Arrow. She had just joined the newly formed Justice League and she and Green Arrow had been tasked with protecting the Japanese Prime Minister. He was being attacked by assassins dressed like Elvis and the whole time they were fighting, Green Arrow was trying (and mostly failing) to flirt with her. Black Canary had cleaned up most of the assassins but Green Arrow shot down an arrow flying at the Prime Minister's head and got all the credit. The archer, Merlyn, got away, but the Prime Minister was safe. After the fight, Batman revealed that he had been watching the whole time. That was ten years ago.</p><p>After Dinah tells her story, Sin asks her if she will marry him. Dinah says that it's complicated. Now that Sin is in her life, she has to watch out for her too, and she'll never have a normal life. When they're done talking and eating, Dinah goes to the bathroom and Sin goes to fool around in the play place. The young girl starts playing with other kids but is accosted by some boys. They try to get her to fight, and when she does, she takes down the whole play area. Dinah runs over and they both quickly run from the building, but as they're leaving, a man in a car is watching them. </p><p>At the hotel they're staying at, Sin goes to get some ice and the man starts talking to her while she's alone. Before he can say very much, Black Canary arrives and kicks him across the parking lot. She then goes over to the man and discovers that she knows who it is. </p><p>Inside the hotel room, Dinah explains to Sin that the man is her ex-husband, Craig Windrow. She asks him why he's there and Craig tells her that he's in money trouble and he needs her to beat up the guys that are after him. Later that night in his own room, Craig is getting attacked just like he knew he would. Black Canary comes by in time to stop the attackers and Craig says that he knew she would. He then tells her that he can get Sin enrolled in a school in Star City and that he'll do it as a way of thanking her.</p><p>The next day, Craig is in the office of a man who collects Green Arrow memorabilia. Their conversation reveals that him getting attacked was just a way to get Black Canary in the proper position for something else. What the something else is, is not mentioned, but the man is revealed to be none other than Green Arrows enemy, Merlyn.</p>",

She is the leader of a small, resolute band that will not forfeit the pursuit of liberty-no matter what the cost. Today, the cost will be high. Martha has seen much in her hundred years, from the triumphs and tragedies of the battlefront, to the deepest reaches of space. Today, she will finally see the truth. Includes a special section of never-before-seen production sketches and drawings that predate Martha's first series, Give Me Liberty, along with Frank Miller's original plot notes, all wrapped inside a high-quality card stock cover. This all-new story by two of comics' legendary creators is the unprecedented conclusion to one woman's epic struggle for life's most valuable quality-freedom. Miller and Gibbons reunite to tell the final chapter!</i></p>",

Superior Boy) will continue his annual quest to be voted into the Council of American Superheroes (C.A.S.H. – a non-profit organization). He does this simply because he is sick of being Superior Boy and longs to be a real hero. Unfortunately for him, he is an idiot. Not only does his costume (and name) make him the laughing stock of the whole convention, but he stupidly \"padded his resume\" and stated that he had every superpower. This means loads of trouble for our hero. Okay, sidekick.</p><p>What does all this mean? If you’re lookin’ for a rockin’ good time (well, one that won’t require a round of antibiotics when you’re done), then don’t miss PAUL JENKINS’ SIDEKICK: SUPER SUMMER SIDEKICK SPECTACULAR #1! Did we mention it was written by PAUL JENKINS? You know, the guy that turned Wolverine into a wussie-boy?</p>",

The Fastest Man Alive.  He is back but was too late to save Bart.  Now he is out to catch Bart's killer.</p><p><em>Flashback to one hour ago</em></p><p>Wally, Linda, and the twins are sucked back to the present day.  Wally finds themselves in front of the Justice League and the Justice Society.  When Wally introduces the twins, Iris and Jai, Superman comments that the last time he saw them (not that long ago) they were still newborns.  Wally cuts him off and says they'll talk about that later.  Wally then senses something wrong in the Speed Force when Batman calls.  He gives them word of what is going down in Los Angeles with the Rogues.</p><p><em>Flashback to 59 minutes ago</em></p><p>In Los Angeles, Bart Allen is dead.  Iris Allen West sits over his body as the Rogues look on.  They seem to be at a loss.  They didn't intend to murder him but things got out of hand.  They quickly realize that all the heroes will be after them and try to place all the blame on Inertia.  As the Rogues try to capture Inertia for betraying his promise of unlimited power to them, he simply runs off.</p><p>Running for his life now, he sees a red and yellow blur coming up from behind.  Inertia's first reaction is that Bart is somehow back.  Seeing the look on his face, he is shocked when he figures it must be Wally even though he thought he was dead.  Wally continues to hold him by the collar, smashing and running along.  Wally begins using the speed force like he never has before.  He begins draining the speed force off of Inertia.  Inertia tries saying that it was Wally that took Bart's powers away, leaving him powerless against the Rogues.  As he tells Wally, a smile comes across his face.  He tells him that when he died, he \"screamed like a little bitch.\"</p><p>Wally is outraged.  He has never wanted to kill a man before and thinks that Inertia is not actually a man.  He's a kid and a clone of Bart.  But he does have a part of Bart in him somewhere.  Wally decides he can't kill him but will do something worse.</p><p><em>One week later</em></p><p>Wally is with his Aunt Iris.  He asks how she and Bart's girlfriend are doing.  Iris says Val is young and will be able to move on.  She was told that if she ever needed or wanted to talk, she's considered family.  She finally asks what happened to Inertia.  Wally tells her that he immobilized him permanently.  He is like a statue but alive, forever staring at a monument of Bart, seeing the man that he could never be. He says that the rest of the Rogues haven't been found yet but he has friends looking for them.  Across the world, they are getting picked up.</p><p>Wally begins to apologize for Bart's death.  Iris stops him and asks if he had a choice in coming back.  Wally says no so Iris tells him to act like Bart and not dwell on things beyond his control.  She tells  him to be a good family man as they look out at the twins with Linda in the backyard.  He asks her if she remembers anything about the future of the West family.  She gets a look in her eyes and says, \"Not really...\"  What we get is a glimpse of the super-powered family.</p>",

He hasn't slept in a year and his angst has reached a peak. He has become the \"character\" Doktor Sleepless and he wishes to bring salvation to those he feel jipped of a future.</p><p>At a local dance club, DJ Amun is confronted by a former lover who has kept his aborted child/fetus with her in a vial around her neck. He freaks out, Sleepless takes his Pronoia, and he ends up killing himself. His friend, Sing, finds out the next morning that Amun is dead, thanks to her contact lens with advanced technology. Sleepless now begins to size up Heavenside with his nurse for his upcoming unveiling.</p><p>At Sing's bookstore, a shipment shows up unsolicited from John Reinhardt and Sing wonders it Johnny is back in town when she sees his address. Accompanying the address, though, is the name Doktor Sleepless and not Johnny's. Sleepless pays visit to a local grinder bar where he revives a man everyone thinks is gone for good. Doing so, he proclaims himself the \"Future Science Jesus\".</p><p>Back at Sing's bookstore, she and her friends enjoy a drink in DJ Amun's honor, putting on his radio show hoping a pre-taped show would be playing. Instead, Sleepless has taken over the airwaves, proclaiming what is on everyone's minds: \"Where is our future? The one we deserve?\" He turns on a signal in the air which shows the number 666 in gears before putting the music back on the air.</p>",

Jackie Estacado's hired a great one (even though he does happen to be blind). But even if Jackie can beat the rap, the Spirit of Vengeance is not so easily satisfied. As if a battle royale between The Darkness and Ghost Rider weren't enough, this special features The Incredible Hulk rampaging through New York City, both the current and former bearers of the Witchblade, and even an appearance by the master of the mystic arts, Doctor Strange.

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>They may be from two different eras, but Spider-Man and Red Sonja have both faced the maniacal mage known as Kulan Gath. Now the sadistic sorcerer makes a play for power that will once again bring these two famous heroes together -- but will it be as friends or foes?</p><p>Writer Michael Avon Oeming (OMEGA FLIGHT, Red Sonja) and Mel Rubi (Red Sonja) – plus series cover artist Michael Turner (CIVIL WAR) – answer the eternal question: What's better in a fight, the proportional strength and speed of a spider, or cold, hard steel and a chain–mail bikini?</p><p>Everything seems ordinary in New York City as Spider-Man swings around town and fights a group of bad guys ... all while talking on his cell phone to MJ!</p><p>At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Senator Thomas is attending a major art exhibit while battling his conscience over some shady dealings with his confidant, Reilly. J Jonah Jameson welcomes the Senator to the exhibit with kind words, hoping to score an interview. Thomas agrees to it, but his eyes are drawn to a unique necklace on display. Though the curator, Professor Jones protests, Thomas puts on the necklace. This in turn releases the imprisoned spirit of the sorcerer Kulan Gath. Using his vast powers, he reshapes New York City into his own medieval/Hyborian version of itself. Spider-Man seems to be the only one unaffected by the spell.</p><p>People are still in need of help, though, so he springs to action to save the commoners. As he does so, Gath wishes Professor Jones to be his scribe. Refusing, Gath kills him and then requests Jameson to take over the duties. Gath then conjures up a sword and tells about how Spider-Man and Red Sonja foiled his plans before when they teamed up. This time he wishes to pit them against each other so they will be occupied. He calls forth Mary Jane to claim the sword and become Red Sonja. Spider-Man continues to fight his assailants, who have somehow become goblins in the meantime. Even though he saves the people, they fear Spider-Man as a demon. Getting away, he sees what used to be the Met and a strange glow. He goes to it to investigate and sees Mary Jane climbing the walls to get to the sword on the roof. Confronting her after she grabs it, he is instead face with Red Sonja.</p>",

His first pairing is Nightwing and Owen Mercer.  Batman informs Nightwing that the S.T.A.R. Labs researching Chemo has gone dark and wants Nightwing to check it out.  Batman believes Owen's super-speed will come in handy while dealing with Chemo's radioactive abilities.</p><p>During the flight to the lab, Owen tries to convince Nightwing that Batman does trust him because of what his father did, and can't look past that to see the good that Captain Boomerang has done.  Nightwing will not argue with Owen, but keeps changing the subject.</p><p>Aboard the Lab the pair quickly learn that everyone is dead and Chemo is still attached to the Lab in his restraints.

But in Aberrance, U.S.A., freaks are big business. On the board of directors sit the freakiest freaks of all - birthed in the profane laboratories of Anton Arcane - THE UN-MEN. </i></p><p><i>In this new, ongoing series - masterfully mixing gritty noir, grindhouse horror and gallows humor - an albino agent known as Kilcrop is dispatched by the government to solve the murder of a sideshow attraction called 'The Gill-Boy.' To uncover the truth, Kilcrop must infiltrate Aberrance, where society's most misshapen outcasts find their own kind of freedom. But with the original Un-Men in charge, Kilcrop must confront a corruption far deeper than the mysterious death of a man who breathes through his neck. And he must deal with his growing love for a one-armed, angel-winged beauty named Niko - an attraction that could prove fatal. The truth he discovers may be the secret hidden within his own outsider's soul.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Exploding from the pages of 52 and exploring the timeline of the DC Universe comes a new monthly book featuring the greatest super-hero history will never know: Booster Gold! Following the universe altering conclusion of 52, Booster Gold wants what’s due to him — a spot on the Justice League of America! But the time stream’s in trouble, and Booster Gold is in the center of it! Now he must make a choice: reclaim his former glory or do the right thing, forgoing the credit. ALL-NEW Booster Gold will take you through time and space, to the greatest moments of the DCU that have happened and will happen. “52 Pick-Up” begins in this extra-sized issue #1! Someone is exploiting the ravaged time stream, hoping to eliminate the world’s greatest heroes — and only Booster Gold can stop them. But, really — Booster Gold? Why him? What does Rip Hunter truly want? And what shocking figure is behind it all? And coming up in the months ahead in DC’s time spanning monthly: the world’s greatest Green Lantern — Sinestro, Jonah Hex, Barbara “Batgirl” Gordon, Flash and Kid Flash, and plenty more of DC’s super stars from throughout its past and future!</i></p><p><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></p><p>=========================</p><p>Two months following the conclusion of <i>52</i>, it's Day 1 of Week 60. Booster and Skeets have been in hiding, waiting for the right time to show their faces once more. They re-debut themselves by taking on the Royal Flush Gang in Atlantic City. Apparently, before the battle started, Michael set off his JLA Emergency signal. After the Gang has been dispatched, the League. Disappointed that Booster would use his Emergency Signal when there is in fact no emergency, they inquire as to his motives. He asks to join the League once again, much to their disdain. It appears that rumors have surfaced saying that Booster faked his death for sympathy, after Steel saw him during WWIII 'running <i>the other way</i>'. Batman and Superman however have faith in Booster, and tell him that he has one week to prove himself.</p><p>It becomes apparent that Booster and Skeets have been taking refuge in the home of Daniel Carter, who refuses to take off the Supernova suit. It evidently \"freezes time\" for the wearer, effectively allowing them to go as long as they want without getting tired, hungry or thirsty. Booster had assumed the Daniel would do some good with the suit, but all he does is play video games all the time. Skeets' historical records are apparently still malfunctioning, making it difficult to use them to their advantage when trying to stop disasters. Michael refuses to use them anyhow, as he considers it \"cheating\".</p><p>Suddenly, in the middle of Daniel's living room, Rip Hunter arrives in his Time Sphere. Booster considers the man to have betrayed him after <i>52</i>, \"leaving Skeets and my reputation in pieces\". Rip scolds Booster for showing his face to the League, saying that he needed to stay in hiding to protect his knowledge of the Multiverse. Hunter takes Booster with him, leaving Daniel in a broken living room. As they traverse the time-stream, Rip reveals that one or more malevolent time-travelers are taking advantage of various \"worm-holes\" left in the aftermath of Mr. Mind's feast. Before he can finish what he's saying though, Rip drops Booster into one of the worm-holes. He finds himself in the midst of World War III once more, near a plummeting 747. He's told my Rip that he <i>must</i> save the plane. After dropping the aircraft off at a Tokyo airport, an investigative reporter by the name of Rose Levin thanks Booster for his bravery. He is quickly pulled back into the time-stream though, and Rip tells him that woman is another of his ancestors. She is to start Michael's direct lineage with Daniel Carter. Rip needs Booster's help to repair the damage to the time-stream, and stop whoever is destroying it. Booster refuses, not willing to sacrifice any more of his reputation just to stay incognito. Rip drops him off at home, disappointed.</p><p>One week later, Booster arrives at the Hall of Justice to hear the League's decision. With smiles across their faces, they hand Booster an invitation to the Justice League of America. However, before his eyes, the certificate transforms into the Death Certificate of Hal Jordan. Terrified, and convinced of Rip's warnings, Booster leaves the Hall, and tells the League that he simply wanted to be able to turn them down. He arrives at Rip's old bunker, and tells him that if he wants his help, they were going to save his best friend first, Ted Kord.</p><p>Elsewhen, somebody has stolen the Supernova suit, and encounters Sinestro on Korugar. \"They call me Supernova. We need to talk about your future.\"</p>",

The nuclear aftermath from the Queen's last adventure put the country on high alert and forced government sanctions on her dictatorship. However, unknown to the Queen, there's a deeper, more evil plot forming right under her feet.</em></p><p>With the Shadow Government in ruins and Bomb Queen very much alive and well, which can't be said for her pet cat Ashe, T-Division (housed at the pentagon) is tasked with assessing her latest threat. The Queen is now declaring war on all heroes that pose a threat to New Port City by announcing preemptive strikes on cities that are home to said heroes. T-Division has recruited 2 members of Woods' team from the first attempt to take down Bomb by political means. their analysis of New Port City is that it corrupts the people who live there and is in fact pure Evil.</p><p>Meanwhile in New Port work has started on construction of Bomb Queen's new HQ the Tactical Information Turret (or T.I.T. for short). To get the work done in secret she hired teams, promises extra pay and perks and then sends them to Momma Wong's for free food where they are poisoned and disposed of. Momma Wong is very concerned that Bomb is taking the new powers she somehow absorbed from Bomb Teen for granted and reminds her that those powers were supplied by the Shadow Government.</p><p>Red Cross is keeping tabs on Bomb after their battle and is reporting back to T-Division on the queens plans. The escalation in threat means they decide to send in a strike team, breaking their bargain with Red Cross to allow her to finish of Bomb Queen once the innocent are rescued.</p><p>Meanwhile in Crawford Texas the military arrive at the presidents ranch and seal it of after a report of WMDs are present. They find a rocket in launch position in a barn.</p><p>At a rally in the main city square Bomb Queen addressed her public, humorously parodying famous speeches, to unanimous acclaim.</p><p>In a final panel a black clawed hand appears as a hidden character claims for a 1000 years of planning it has come to this, that all the puppets are now dancing to his tune, the forces of Earth, Heaven nor Hell will not be able to oppose him.</p>",

He begins to question how can he know if they are the people he's trying to protect or if they are really the enemy in disguise.<br /></p><p>Trying to figure out how to get his thoughts together, Captain America enters the room.  Handing him his helmut, Cap gives him the inspiration to get up and continue.<br /></p><p>Outside, one of Newman's squad members is pinned under some debris.  Cap uses his shield to block shots while Newman pulls the man free.  Another squad member is stuck in his tank with a broken leg. Captain America tells him that they are there to help him.  Newman manages to get him out and and carry him to safety.<br /></p><p>Newman calls out for Cap, asking if he can see anyone else that needs their help.  A voice tells him that he can hear him.  The man talking is his actual captain in his squad.  Newman asks where did Cap go?  He was right there.  His squad says it sounds like he's talking about Captain America and Newman says he is.  He tells them that Cap was next to him and helped save the men.  They all say that they only saw Newman.  The way he was fighting, he wouldn't have needed Captain America's help.<br /></p><p>Now Newman wonders if he's been fighting for too long.  He wonders if he's losing his mind.  Calling out for Cap, the scene shifts to a weakened Captain America lying in a hospital bed.  He speaks to Newman even though he can't hear him saying he's braver than he thinks.</p>",

But who is really right and who is really wrong? </p><p> <b> Issue Summary: </b></p><p> </p><p>The Eldest of a bug-like, alien race stares outside his window. Even after a millennium, he can still hear the screams. Outside, a gigantic battle is taking place, resulting in fiery explosions of death and destruction. Some other members of the race appear behind the Eldest, and warn him about a new development in the war:<em>they</em> have come… <em>the Shi’ar</em>. The Eldest realizes what that means: the time has come…</p><p><em>Shi’ar space, weeks later… <br />The supply line to the fourth Shi’ar fleet…</em></p><p>Inside one of the several Shi’ar ships lined up nearby three moons, a trooper wishes to speak to his captain. He reports their long-range sensors make no sense, as there an anomaly has been detected. There’s a strong electromagnetic field, but the trooper cannot detect its source. It is everywhere. “Gods preserve,” the captain panics. It’s a trap! The captain orders all of his Warbirds to go to condition black, because… the Starjammers are here!</p><p>Outside, the Starjammer ship approaches the Warbirds. Ch’od appears on the Warbird’s computer screen, and advises them to surrender. The captain of course refuses. To this, Ch’od replies that he shall put him in the “not wise” category then.</p><p>A moment later, the Starjammers, led by Havok, teleport within the ship and lay siege. The captain opens fire on them and orders his Warbirds to kill them all. Havok fires a blast in defense, but reminds his team that they need the captain alive. Lorna, as she magnetically tackles some soldiers down, jokes that she thinks Alex is talking to Rachel, because she stopped being crazy months ago. Rachel fires a telepathic blast on another soldiers, and mentions she’ll do her best, but will make no promises. Korvus Rook’Shir slashes his huge and powerful Blade of the Phoenix through his opponents, and mopes that the X-Men talk far too much in battle.</p><p>The captain warns his Warbirds not to let the Starjammers take over his ship. He is half-way through ordering the activation the self-destruct mechanism when Raza sneaks up on the captain and points his sword in the captain’s face, indicating he should stop where he stands. The captain obeys.</p><p>With the bridge now secured, Havok orders to open the comm channel. The captain shouts that taking his ship won’t accomplish anything. He points out there are eleven more Warbirds guarding the supply line, and one ship alone can’t stand against them. To this, a voice via comm. replies that he is correct… but the Starjammer is not alone. Seeing the source of the voice, the captain sees a screen on which Lilandra and her Major-General, Ka’ardum, appear. The captain is surprised to see them both still alive. Havok wants to talk to the captain about him and his regiment to join the resistance. Alex wants to discuss Emperor Vulcan.</p><p><em>Meanwhile on Chandilar, throneworld of the Shi’ar Empire…</em> <br />Weapon in hand, an armed soldier yells “death to the false emperor. Death to Vul…” At that moment, Vulcan fires his power blast at the soldier and kills him in mid-sentence. Vulcan tells his council that they’ll have to start over because he couldn’t hear anything over the screaming.</p><p>Vulcan goes to sit back on his throne, with his wife Deathbird standing beside him. Accompanying his court is a host of soldiers, positioned as an honor guard. Among their number is the superguardian, Gladiator. Returning to the subject at hand, Vulcan asks Araki to confirm what he just told him – that he isn’t loved by the Shi’ar people. Clearly nervous, Araki promises that he wouldn’t attempt to dishonor his lord, even if it meant his life. But it’s true, the Shi’ar Empire is tearing itself apart. The resistance to Vulcan’s rule is strong. His… elimination of former Emperor D’Ken has divided the people. And with Lilandra and Major-General Ka’ardum working with the resistance, more and more of the military are defecting.</p><p>To this, Gladiator dourly proclaims that these people lack honor. As Deathbird quietly smiles, Vulcan is more concerned that he isn’t loved by the people and demands to hear the truth. Araki is hesitant for a moment and then, with a bow, explains that only the presence of a member of the Neramani bloodline as royal consort is holding the remaining supporters in place.</p><p>Turning to his wife, Vulcan asks her what she thinks of that. Deathbird walks forward to Araki, and slashes his face with her sharp nails. As Araki reels in pain, Deathbird thinks aloud that Araki is a politician who likes to play games. She advisess him to remember that Vulcan is the Emperor now, whether the Secret Order likes it or not.</p><p>Changing subjects, Vulcan wants to hear about his brother now. He wants to hear about Havok and the Starjammers. He wants to know why they aren’t dead already.</p><p><em>The Clench Worlds, near Shi’ar space…</em> <br />Havok stands in the center of a briefing room, next to a holo projector on which a planet and its three moons are show. Addressing the assembly, he explains to his fellow Starjammers and newly gained allies in the warbirds. He shows them a hologram of three supply lines they have now captured. He thinks that, without resources and supplies, the empire’s war effort will be weakened and harder to sustain. The gasp is closing.</p><p>Alex next shows an image of a station called Feather’s Edge. He explains it’s defended by a series of Armageddon-class killstations. He admits their battle won’t be pretty, but cutting off Feather’s Edge will weaken Vulcan’s forces to a breaking point. Lilandra and Ka’ardum are also among the assembly. Alex tells Ka’ardum they’ve avoided amassing his armada until now, but Vulcan’s forces still outnumber theirs. However, Alex believes taking this target will even the odds. And afterward, they’ll bring the fight to Chandilar.</p><p>In a section off from the main area, Ch’od tells Lorna he’s confused. If Alex is filled with this “self-doubt” she spoke off, he thinks they should all start doubting themselves immediately. They’ll win this war much quicker, he jokes. Lorna responds that Ch’od should just wait for it. Lorna also notices Korvus is not present in the hearing. She noticed Korvus seemed cranky on the supply mission, and asks Rachel if the two of them are still fighting. Rachel answers that she broke off their relationship. They’re just too different. It’s too weird and too complicated. She thinks she should be okay, if she can keep from making out with him.</p><p>Back in the main chamber, Ka’ardum compliments Havok on the briefing and that, in such a short time, he has become an expert on the Shi’ar military landscape. He mentions that Alex’ strategies are excellent, and that he’s surprised Earth can spare such a natural leader. Alex points out that he’s just there to stop Vulcan. His brother Cyclops was a great leader, and so was his father. But not him, Alex sighs. Ch’od and the others heard Alex say this, Ch’od now seeing the doubt, much to his dismay.</p><p><em>Later, at the planet “Standing Still” <br />The resistance headquarters…</em> <br />Havok walks through the city streets, which are crowded by other aliens. He is approached by Korvus, who informs Alex that the people here are calling him “savior.” He gives them hope. Alex says they’re making a mistake. He’s just a man, and not much of one at that. Korvus grins that, luckily, their enemy is but a child. Alex agrees, but their opponent is the most powerful child in the galaxy.</p><p>As they stand before a grand view, a planet and two other moons rising above a desert landscape, Alex does his best to change subjects. When he asks Korvus if he and Rachel are still fighting, Korvus replies that Rachel vexes him. He finds it weird: war spreads across the galaxy, and he cannot stop thinking about her. He asks Alex for advice, seeing he is Rachel’s uncle. The only thing Alex can come up with, is saying that Rachel likes cheeseburgers.</p><p><em>At a bar…</em> <br />Nursing a drink at a bar, Rachel mopes that she could use a cheeseburger right now. And sweatpants. She misses her sweatpants. It feels like they’ve been out here forever. With her at the bar, whose patrons include numerous species of aliens, Lorna mentions that Alex told her he believes he can’t beat Vulcan. Alex knows he tried, but also that he failed. And that his father died for that. That’s what he thinks. Lorna jokes she thinks she’ll have to beat Alex up.</p><p>Changing subjects, she asks Rachel if she’s okay. Korvus distracted her, Rachel replies. He clouded everything. But she finally talked to Lilandra. Lorna is surprised to hear that, because they asked Rachel not to do so. Continuing, Rachel says she learned there is a Secret Order within the Shi’ar Empire. They’re the ones who ordered to murder her family. When Lorna begins to show sympathy, Rachel becomes angry, a blue Phoenix sign appears over her eye. She vows that after they’ve taken Vulcan down, she’ll find this Secret Order and will make them pay.</p><p><em>Chandilar, the Shi’ar throneworld…</em> <br />As he walks incognito among his citizens, a hooded Vulcan overhears two soldiers talking to each other. One of them heard that Vulcan was a slave, and that D’Ken took him in but that Vulcan in turned betrayed D’Ken and murdered him. The other soldier heard the same, but also that Vulcan is another mutant from Earth. Just like Lilandra’s<em>shame</em>… Xavier, whom they see as the Mummudrai destroyer. This soldier also believes someone should shoot Vulcan in the head before he destroys the Empire. Both soldiers want a true Shi’ar on the throne.</p><p>Though Vulcan grows angry, he doesn’t interfere. Instead, he is distracted by an image of himself on a large screen, and Shi’ar letters are marked over it. A female voice explains to Vulcan that the words mean: “<em>kill the false Emperor</em>.”</p><p>Turning to the voice, Vuclan is surprised to find Cal’syee, who’s also hooded. Deathbird jokes that the Emperor should not travel without an Imperial Guard escort. Gabriel points out that the Guard are as likely to try and kill him as anyone else, to which Deathbird confirms that’s true. The Guard does hate him. Vulcan isn’t exactly glad to hear that, but Deathbird asks her husband to let her finish. She thinks people hate their Emperor because they do not know him. Because they do not know that Gabriel<em>is</em> a Shi’ar.</p><p>Vulcan can’t believe his ears. Deathbird gently touches Gabriel’s face, and confirms the truth in her words. She can see it inside him, and is certain that the time will come when Gabriel shows the Empire that he was born to rule them. He will show them greatness that D’Ken never possessed. He will show them strength that Lilandra never had. And she’s certain that people will love him for that. As she does. They kiss. Deathbird asks Gabriel to come with her, as his spies have brought much news. She wants them to plan the death of the resistance.</p><p><em>Later, at Feather’s Edge…</em> <br />Polaris magnetically charges the Starjammers ship so their enemies can’t detect them. Havok compliments her on that, but Lorna asks them to hurry though. When Alex asks him if they’re ready, Ch’od replies that Corsair used to sing a song to lead them into battle. Alex asks if that’s true. “No,” Ch’od answers. His visage growing serious, Alex announces he is ready to do this.</p><p>Both the Starjammer ship and the Warbird ships start firing at Feather’s Edge, which does its best to defend itself. Still, Shi’ar stations explode under the attack. When an alarm suddenly fills the bridge, Alex quickly asks Ch’od for a status report. Incoming, he reports. By the energy signature… the Shi’ar are there… and lots of them. When Havok then turns to her, Rachel telepathically scans and confirms… Vulcan is there.</p><p>Standing confidently in his royal flagship together with Gladiator, Vulcan grins that his empire’s spies <em>are</em> good. He orders to kill the X-Men, Lilandra and Ka’ardum. He’s sure the others will fall in line afterward.</p><p>As the Shi’ar armada opens fire, Havok orders evasive maneuvers. However, Ch’od had already anticipated the order and has done so. Nearby, Raza notes that Vulcan brought the entire Shi’ar fleet with him, so that must mean he knew they were coming.</p><p><em>Meanwhile, at the wing of K’ythri, Ka’ardum’s battlecruiser…</em> <br />Lilandra and Ka’ardum see how their enemies concentrate fire on the Starjammers. She fears they’ll be killed. Ka’ardum thinks his ship will surely be next. Vulcan’s forces still outnumber theirs, even if by a little, and Vulcan also still has the Imperial Guard behind him. He fears that, if they fight now, they’ll all be killed. Lilandra doesn’t respond.</p><p>In his ship, Vulcan asks Gladiator if they should kill all of their opponents. He remembers that Gladiator said before that the Shi’ar who deflected lack honor. He wants to know if Gladiator would kill them all. Hesitant, Gladiator says that he only serves. It’s not his place to decide. Gabriel asks Gladiator that when he took his eye, if that was service as well. Or simply a decision?</p><p>They are interrupted by a powerful explosion, which tears Vulcan’s ship in half! The cause is a host of newly arrived fleet of immense, bug-like ships that fill the sky and outnumbering both fleets.</p><p>As Ka’ardum reels at the sight of the Hammer having been destroyed, Lilandra asks her uncle what’s going on. Whose ships are those? Interrupting, one of the bridge crew announces that the newcomers are broadcasting something.</p><p>Meanwhile, in their own ship, the Starjammers don’t understand what’s going on either. Raza smiles that it really happened… the ship that just blew up was the Emperor’s. Nearby, Ch’od learns via the broadcast that their new allies are calling themselves the Scy’ar Tal. He finds that a bold choice. Likewise, Korvus recognizes the meaning of the name, as does Rachel. “Scy’ar Tal” means… “death to the Shi’ar.” The name of their race means “Death to the Shi’ar.”</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>After the disastrous events of AMAZONS ATTACK, Wonder Girl strikes out to tie up some particularly monstrous loose ends. But with the rift between her and Wonder Woman, she's going to need the help of the last man on Earth she ever wanted to see again! WONDER GIRL will take Cassie Sandsmark to all corners of the DCU, from the dangers within WONDER WOMAN to TEEN TITANS to COUNTDOWN, and will change Wonder Girl forever!</p><p>With the world not too fond of Wonder Girl's recent actions during the Amazons Attack war, Cassie is living a low-key life in Georgetown, Washington D.C. When going out, she takes a cue from Connor and wears glasses and puts her hair up. She is renting a room from an elderly lady. She tells her that they will be getting a new \"roommate\" as a visiting professor will be staying there.</p><p>Heading to a pay phone, Cassie has arranged to receive a call from her mother at a set time. It turns out her mother bought a cell phone which concerns Cassie. She is concerned with how she paid for the phone and what name she used. She has been staying in Greece and says having a cell phone would make it easier to contact her. Cassie says she should just call the Titans Tower but her mom says she's never there anymore. Cassie sees a news report on a television in a store window with Robin and darts off, cutting off her conversation with her mother.</p><p>A protest is happening over some hydra eggs left over from the Amazons. The police aren't sure what to do with them and there are people protesting over animal rights. Wonder Girl shows up and says they need to be destroyed. They are too dangerous to keep at a zoo or sanctuary. Robin says there's always Superman's Fortress. Robin tells here that he was actually in the area to talk to her. He wants to talk about the kiss they shared. He stumbles with his words and she takes it the wrong way. Then the hyrdas begin to hatch. Robin throws some batarangs at them wondering how they can stop them. Cassie simply replies by going up to each head and snapping it's neck.</p><p>Robin tells her that was impressive but scary. He wants to finish what he was trying to say. Cassie cuts him off saying she gets it. It was just a \"heat of the moment\" thing. Upset, she flies off before he can say another word. Left behind, Robin says now he understands why Batman avoids the relationships.</p><p>Elsewhere, some Army soldiers prepare to take on another Amazonian beast. Some battle beasts have been seen. Wonder Girl arrives and tells them they will not be able to handle them. When the commander tries telling her that she needs to leave and that it's her people's fault this is going on, she destroys their vehicles. She tells them they are not equipped to handle them. If they want to kill themselves trying, they are welcome to it.</p><p>Spying a battle beast sleeping, she figures taking out one shouldn't be a problem. Detecting her scent, it wakes up. As she takes it down, she is soon visited by three more. Not sure if she can take on all three, she is surprised to hear her \"brother\" Hercules is there to help her.</p>",

When we last checked in on Cal, he and Mo'Lock had just witnessed the vile, horrifying transformation of Cal's lovely ex, Sabrina Lynch, into a minion of the vampire Nosferatu. After that Cal disappeared for a bit, and at the start of our new series, Mo'Lock finds him just in time to lure him off the filthy couch in an abandoned house with an offer he can't refuse-either he gets up and takes a new case, or Mo'Lock will kill him before the drugs can. And what a case it is. Devil worshippers in sunny SoCal are doing their best to bring Satan into the world, and by the looks of things, Cal's already too late.

Can Tommy help them out? Will he? Unpleasant secrets from the past return...on the Darkside.</em></p><p>Clark Kent is interviewed by a young journalist curious to find out the connection between Superman and a contract killer named Tommy Monaghan, known as Hitman. Kent tells the reporter of what happened some years before when the JLA were based at the Watchtower on the moon. Green Lantern leaves the Watchtower to investigate a damaged space shuttle that NASA has lost contact with. Scanning the craft with his ring and sending the results back to the tower alerts Batman to a potential threat.Monaghan, meanwhile, is in Gotham following a tip-off that four killers are after him. As the killers argue about who is in charge, Monaghan throws a bomb into the room, killing all of them.At the Watchtower, Batman reveals what was identified by Lantern's ring once he returns. The Bloodline parasites appear to be on the space probe. Realising they need a survivor of the parasites' earlier attack, Batman heads down to Gotham where he finds Monaghan and brings him back to the moon. Green Lantern is embarrassed when Monaghan recognises him and tells the others of how they had teamed up, causing Batman to lecture Lantern on the morality of associating with a hired killer. His tirade is cut short when Superman walks in and recognises Monaghan, greeting him as a friend. Batman tells Superman of Monaghan's profession which he shamefacedly admits to. Monaghan's blood is tested and compared to the readings from the probe; the creatures on the probe appear more advanced and a greater threat. The League disagree on how to deal with the threat of the aliens but their hand is forced when the probe accelerates and heads for the moon; it crashlands and Superman flies out to find any survivors. At the Watchtower, the four remaining heroes and Monaghan suddenly feel their individual powers waning and it is Monaghan who reminds them that if it has happened to all of them, it may have happened to Superman who is outside on the moon's surface.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Finally! Part Five of <strong>Who Is Wonder Woman?</strong></p><p><em>Overview</em></p><p>At long last, the climactic, extra-length chapter of \"Who is Wonder Woman?\", the story that launched the WONDER WOMAN monthly! In this arc's conclusion, the combined forces of Wonder Woman's transformed rogues gallery declare an all-out war on the amazing Amazon, compelling Wonder Woman to mend fences and join forces with Donna Troy and Wonder Girl if she's going to survive to answer the question: \"Who is Wonder Woman?\"</p><p>And if the return of Allan Heinberg and Terry Dodson isn't enough, there's also an all-new backup by Heinberg and the upcoming art team of ACTION COMICS, Gary Frank and Jonathan Sibal, featuring the secret origins of Wonder Woman, Donna Troy, Wonder Girl, Sarge Steel and Nemesis! All questions will be answered, all secrets revealed!</p><p>Wonder Woman is confronted by her entire rogues gallery, where she finds herself at a disadvantage because their powers have been enhanced by Circe. All of them persuade Wonder Woman to join them as rulers of the new world. She asks how they would run the place any better than it is and they reply that the politicians and corporations are far more dangerous than them.</p><p>Wonder Woman fights back but her enemies overpower her because of their sheer numbers. Just as it seems as if Wonder Woman is about to lose, the rest of Earth's superheroes arrive on the scene and help her out. As they join her, she asks how they managed to find her. She is told that they found a herb which was connected to Circe, so they visited her home of Aeaea.</p><p>Nemesis tells Wonder Woman that she was missed and Donna tells her that she was never comfortable taking her place. Wonder Woman thanks them for helping but she says that this battle with Circe and Hercules is her own fight.</p><p>She flies to the temple and sees Hercules and Circe fighting. As Hercules grabs Circe by the throat, Wonder Woman hurls across the chamber. Hercules manages to trip her and hold her against the floor with a sword to her throat. He offers her a chance to build a new Olympus but Wonder Woman refuses. He says that he will take her by force, just like he did to Hippolyta and Wonder Woman manages to push her off.</p><p>She pins him down with his own sword and threatens him that she is willing to kill him. Circe steps him and says that this is her duty now and she blasts Hercules with her magic, wrapping him in chains. Wonder Woman turns to Circe and says that however righteous her intentions, the witch has caused just as much suffering. However, Circe justifies herself saying that her eternity is her punishment. Diana then realises that they have something in common – that they both want to be human. Circe reminds Diana that she had done that before by stripping Circe of her powers. Circe then asks if Wonder Woman would be human if she had a choice. She replies that she is grateful for such blessings, but she is hardly human being made from clay. She has no idea who she is or what she is. All she knows is that she is alone, but Circe replies, \"Which is how most humans feel all the time.\" The other super heroes approach Circe and adds that Diana has never been alone. Unbeknown to Wonder Woman, she performs one final act of magic on the Amazon Princess.</p><p>A few days later at the Department of Meta Human Affairs, Agent Prince and Nemesis are debriefing Sarge Steel on recent events. Afterwards, they collect the capture rogues' weapons. He hands her the Valkyrie's sword and cuts herself. She stares down in shock. Nemesis tells her that it is only a scratch, but to her, it is something much more.</p><p>Later, she meets up with Donna and shows her her cut hand. Donna asks what happened and Diana tells her that her powers are gone, unless she transforms into Wonder Woman. She does her twirl and instantly heals. Donna asks why Circe would do such a thing. Diana replies that if the witch wanted to kill her, she would've have done that a long time ago. Instead, she believes that Circe had given her a gift. Wonder Girl arrives and says that witches don't leave gifts, but curses, which means that Circe has made it impossible for Diana to Agent Prince. But Diana disagrees and actually thinks that Circe is allowing her to be Diana Prince for the first time. That way, when she transforms into it's not because she has to, but rather choose and want to.</p><p>The both of them fly off to arrange a press conference of Wonder Woman's return, and Diana meets up with Batman on a rooftop. She thanks him for helping her out. He replies, \"They love you Diana. They always have. Because that's what you inspire in anyone who's ever met you. That's what makes you more powerful than any of us.\"</p>",

Created in 1975 by Steve Gerber and Mary Skrenes, the original Omega The Unknown lasted only ten issues but was a legend to those who recall it -- an ahead-of-its-time tale of an anti-hero, inflected with brilliant ambiguity. One of Omega's teenage fans was award-winning novelist Jonathan Lethem, who has used the original as a springboard for a superbly strange, funny, and moving graphic novel in ten chapters.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The new Green Arrow/Black Canary team investigates the shocking results of the Wedding of the Century in an all-new adventure that brings the Star City-crossed lovers together!</i></p><p>The issue begins with a flashback, as an introduction to their beginning relationship. Green Arrow asks if she’s Black Canary, and Black Canary wonders if he’s Green Arrow. Some flirting happens between them, with Black Canary saying, “If your idea of a pickup line is complimenting my mother, your game needs work.” Green Arrow replies that that wasn’t a pickup line, and he really is a fan of Black Canary’s mother. He also adds that his game doesn’t need work. Black Canary thinks differently, as she says, “I think you just sat on some chewing gum.” She adds that she “only noticed because I was checking out your ass even more than you were checking out mine.”</p><p>It cuts back to present time, where some mercenaries are running from trouble, and Black Canary flies in, kicking a mercenary. She fights the mercenaries single handily. She beats them all, when one of the down mercenary gives her attitude. She turns around and beats him, to the point of near death. Green Arrow, who is currently taken by Connor Hawke, flies in, and tells her to stop. He also comments that he’s been seeing that a lot lately. Black Canary walks off and says, “Well I guess everyone’s lucky you’re here to referee.</p><p> </p><p>At Connor’s apartment, he has a conversation with Speedy and comments on Black Canary’s behaviour. He tells her of how she almost beat a man to death and says, “She’s… she’s not coping very well,” and Speedy replies, “Oh my God… You really think so, Dr. Phil?”</p><p> </p><p>Elsewhere with Black Canary, she stares at Oliver Queen’s dead body in a glass coffin and remembers the night in which he almost killed her with a knife. In self defence, she killed him with one of this own arrows and stabbed him in the neck. It cuts to a montage, where many members of the Justice League of America console her. Hal Jordon says that they should perhaps bury the body as it’s been a month already. Black Canary says that it’s not him, but Hal thinks she is in denial. She insists that it’s not him, but Hal thinks differently. She continues to explain that it isn’t him. The man that attempted to kill her wasn’t him, but Hal keeps telling her that she is in denial. He tells her in frustration how he would want him alive too and too. Hal points Black Canary to his ring, and says that the ring doesn’t lie. Batman cuts in, and says that it can be deceived. Black Canary asks if he believes her, and in agreement, he says that all this makes very little sense.</p><p> </p><p>He continues to explain how it’s strange, because if someone has gotten Green Arrow to murder her during the night, it’s a good plan but it’s been a month and no one come to finish the job. He also continues to explain that if someone wanted Green Arrow dead, that wouldn’t make sense too, because if someone did kill him, they would want to gloat about it and no one has done so. He also wasn’t in anything that would was on about that would make him a target either.</p><p> </p><p>At the Batcave, Dr. Mid-Nite and Batman are preparing to do an autopsy on Green Arrow and tells Black Canary that she should probably go site somewhere else, because it’s going to be ugly. Black Canary disagrees, unless they’re going to chop his body up and run it through a processor. Dr. Mid-Nite explains that’s <i>exactly</i> what they’re going to do. Black Canary, shocked, says she’s going to sit by the car. As they perform the autopsy, they scan the body and find nothing unusual. Dr. Mid-Nite then sees something strange. He compares this autopsy from the one done before and explains that the cells from the autopsy done now has less tissue from his upper thigh, which means it’s no Oliver Queen’s DNA, and the cells are still reactive. Batman asks what that means; does it mean the cells are still alive? Dr. Mid-Nite explains that they’re dead, but they’ll become active once again if activated. He sticks a contraption with a needle on the end, and Oliver dissipates into someone else: Everyman. Black Canary adds that he’s a shapeshifter, and that they have to find Oliver if he’s still alive. Batman says that they need to find out who has him first before they can begin their search. Batman questions Black Canary, asking her if anyone strange has approached her since Oliver’s “death”. Black Canary thinks, and thinks of the Amazons.</p><p> </p><p>On Themyscira, the Amazons have held Oliver captive.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>This 8-part epic explores the underbelly of the DC Universe and ties in to COUNTDOWN! Frank Tieri and COUNTDOWN's J. Calafiore team up to deliver an action-packed tale that features Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Batwoman and just about every other Gotham guest-star imaginable. As more and more evildoers seemingly disappear into thin air, Gotham City finds itself in the midst of a villainous vacuum. Who will rise to commandeer the remainder of Gotham's rogues? As several factions scramble to stake their claim, Batman and friends strategize a counter-attack!</i></p> <p>Man-Bat is flying through Gotham City, and some special agents are capturing him. One warns the others that if Man-Bat flies through the open city, then they will fail their mission. One fires a net and captures Man-Bat and he falls to the floor. They approach him and are about to put him into the truck when he breaks free and bane punches Man-Bat out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, James Gordon has signalled the Bat Signal and says, “You need practice.” He refers to Robin’s sneak, and how it needs more practice. Robin replies that he’ll work on it. Down below, there are some thugs and some sort of riot, with the police obviously not being able to control it. James Gordon explains how crime activity has erupted after Black Mask’s death. And with no one to take over, all gangs are going for the position. Things are heating up while Gordon continues explaining, with the police warning them to calm down. Gordon says that this will definitely turn into another gang war, worse than before. Shots are fired and Robin jumps down, while Gordon comments on his entry: “Passable at best.”</p> <p>Elsewhere, Bruce Wayne is undercover as Matches Malone. Even though Matches Malone is just another disguise over his real self, he finds this one much more liberating, being able to rough up thugs in which otherwise Batman couldn’t do. Penguin comments on his style: “I like that.” Matches calls Penguin “boss” and he says he would have never thought of saying that. He then continues with his thoughts on how he never thought it would be necessary to infiltrate Penguin’s nightclub under his guise; the nightclub called The <b>Iceberg Lounge</b>; the official place to meet all the criminals in Gotham City. He comments on the high prices of the drinks here, but not as much as the criminal activities being discussed. “Ya got those guns we talked about?”, “Wait fifteen minutes then meet me by the car.”, “… And I need it to look like an accident.”, “I need to move a lot of product in a hurry, no questions asked.”, “You’ll get handsomely take care of, I promise you.” Matches then continues with his thoughts, as he wants Penguin to fill in Black Mask’s spot. He continues to explain that the Iceberg Lounge has been kidnapping criminals, by bringing them here with their “entertainment shows”. But Matches has a clue that it was The Suicide Squad kidnapping the criminals. He doesn’t know why their interest in Penguin is connected to the rumours that he has started some kind of underground place for criminals. Either way, he intends to get to the bottom of this.</p> <p>“Is this seat taken?” asks Two-Face. Penguin spits his drink out and greets him nervously. Two-Face realises this new underground thing. Captain Boomerang knows too, and so does the Riddler. Two-Face wants to know about this underground thing, and threatens Penguin to tell him. Penguin gives in and spills the beans. He tells him to meet him after closing.</p> <p>Outside the club, Alfred wants to get in, but is stopped by the bodyguard because he doesn’t recognise Alfred. Alfred then plays the pity man, and tells him that he wishes to wager on Batman… and brings out a wad of cash. The bodyguard then lets him in. But Nightwing is behind the bodyguard and slams his head against the metal door. He walks in, as if he is a guest in the club and everyone is surprised that a lone hero would walk into a villain hideout. All of the bodyguards bring out their guns and starts bringing them down. While Nightwing is taking care of the bodyguards, the bartender is brings out his own gun, with Nightwing oblivious to him. A bottle crashes against his head, and Alfred has saved the day. Nightwing then comments on how simple goons could have gotten these weapons. Nightwing then surmises that there’s a new player in town. </p> <p>It then cuts to a restaurant, where some thug dealings are happening. The bosses of each of the two gangs are discussing on how to take out all the thugs and finally take the Black Mask spot. One thug boss, called Odessas says he wants to east side, because that side makes more money. But the other thug boss refuses, as he claims that they have had the east side for many generations. Then another thug boss, called Tobias Whale comes in and stabs them both with his harpoon arrow and introduces himself. He continues to talk, and says that they should thank him for removing the two immovable objects that were preventing them from taking over Gotham City. He explains that because of scenes like that is why they are never able to get a real leader around here. He tells them that with the next few days, he will be arranging a meeting between all the heads of the Gotham crime families.</p> <p>Back in the Iceberg Lounge, Matches adds that he Hugo Strange, Scarecrow and the Mad Hatter have now joined, saying how they are scared. He comments on Penguin, and how he likes it like that, and how he enjoys taking advantage of it, manipulating whoever he wants under his thumb. But Matches wants that, at least until he can figure out what happening in Gotham City. His city. And that’s why he’s Matches this time, not Batman. Matches would allow him to fall back on something soft, unlike his cowl and cape counterpart, suddenly the Suicide Squad breaks in and captures all the criminals in the lounge. Matches comments on how this is their second appearance, and he too gets hit behind the head by Bane.</p>",

Superstars Ed Brubaker (UNCANNY X-MEN, CAPTAIN AMERICA) and Marc Silvestri (UNCANNY X-MEN, NEW X-MEN) bring you the first chapter of the story that fans will be talking about for years.</i></p><p><i>Just when it looked like there was no possibility of a future for mutants, hope arrives. But the X-Men aren’t there to meet it—The Marauders and Purifiers beat them to it.</i></p><p><i>Now the race is on to get the first new mutant since HOUSE OF M!</i></p><p><i>The story that begins here continues through all the X-Men books. Don’t miss it!</i></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Professor X locates the birth of a new Mutant in the small town of Cooperstown, Alaska. This birth marks a milestone because it is the first mutant child born since the Scarlet Witch de-powered over 90% of the worlds mutant population on M-Day. The instant loss of millions of mutants made mutant kind an endangered species, the mutant X-Gene being \"erased\" from those who were de-powered (including all stored samples of mutant DNA), as well as no other mutant children having been born since.</p><p>The birth of the mutant occured while Professor X was discussing the mutant crisis with Beast and searching out all current mutants with Cerebro. The psychic feedback resulting from the mutants birth overloaded both Professor X's brain as well as Cerebro, frying the powerful computer. It also caused a power surge within the mansion which caused all lights within the mansion to explode and power to be lost. An event of such importance would surely get the attention of others, and Xavier quickly gathered a small group of experienced X-Men to travel to Alaska in the Blackbird. The team consisted of Angel, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Emma Frost, and Cyclops. When they arrived in Cooperstown they found the town burning and virtually all of its inhabitants either dead or wounded.</p><p>While trying to rescue the remaining inhabitants and piece together exactly what had transpired the X-Men found the dead bodies of several Purifiers as well as the shattered body of the Prism. Emma Frost scanned the mind of one of the survivors to discover that the Purafiers had been dispatched to kill all children of the town in order to make sure that they had killed the new mutant. Sinister's Marauders, including former X-Men Gambit and Sunfire stopped the Purafiers and left to locate the new mutant. It was then that the X-Men learned that the new mutant was just born rather than a teenager. This confusion is expected as mutant powers typically manifest around puberty, not from birth. The X-Men departed Alaska to plan their next move, not knowing that the geneticaly-engineered mutant hunting monstor Predator X just arrived in Cooperstown. Predator X was created to hunt and feed upon powerful mutants, and it is hungy for the new child.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The prestigious Mythos format returns as we find out how Marvel’s First Family became the team they are today! Paul Jenkins tells the tale while Paolo Rivera delivers the beautiful fully painted origin of the FANTASTIC FOUR!</em></p><p>The group, before they were known as the Fantastic Four, are at a meeting to recount what happened. The point of this session was to decide whether the public would be safe for the public.</p><p>Reed Richards recounts the beginnings, saying that it started at breakfast. Ben Grimm was serving eggs as Sue Storm comments on the eggs, asking if they really were eggs. Meanwhile, Johnny Storm is outside having fun with the spacesuit. Inside, Grimm comments on how Johnny is going to get himself killed, and asks about the solar storm. He also wonders about their communication systems, hoping they will not get knocked out. Reed, in his science talk, talks about how it is highly unlikely that it would happen. Grimm is still unconvinced as he comments on the equipment being quite sensitive, and the fact that the Russians wouldn’t be too happy if they destroyed it all.</p><p>At the meeting, Congressman Sen Buntz questions where Johnny was, and asks him if he was outside. Johnny confirms that. Another congressman asks if he was doing a maintenance check, and Johnny uneasily asks if he gets to plead the fifth amendment.</p><p>Outside the spaceship, Johnny was out having fun with the spacesuit rather than doing maintenance checks. In the spaceship, Sue calls for Johnny, but says that he turned his intercom off. He asks Grimm if he could bring him inside himself. Grimm asks him to come inside, but Johnny says he can’t hear him. Inside, Sue says that the sensor is acting up. Reed says that that can’t be right as the solar storm is meant to happen tomorrow. Outside, Grimm is getting audio interference. It turns out that Johnny didn’t turn off his intercom in the first place – it was rather the solar storm causing this interference. Grimm realises what is happening and rush to get inside, while Reed tells them to enter the escape shuttle rather than the main body of the ship. Johnny sees the solar storm and is awe. Their intercoms buzz of interference. Reed opens up the outer bay doors to the escape shuttle as Grimm is struggling to reel Johnny in with him. But it’s too late as the solar storm destroys the ship. Each of them has their own thoughts while this is happening. Sue wishes she could make herself disappear, Reed wishes she could reach for Sue, Grimm was angry because he didn’t want to die like this, and Johnny thought was <strong><em>hot</em></strong>.</p><p>At the control station, they lose contact with them, and see the escape shuttle from the sky. Everything is in a rush as emergency teams tend to the injured four. The radiation team survey the area and one comments on the amount of radiation in there, as shown by the Geiger counter.</p><p>Back at the meeting, one congressman asks that if the reactor was compromised, wouldn’t one of them have to pilot the ship manually before switching the autopilot? He also asks whether they could have preserved the research material or not. Sue interjects, and explains that if they stayed there, they would have died, and asks them to show them the alpha and theta waves as they themselves had not predicted it. If they could, they would have escaped immediately, or would have been prepared. The congresswoman interjects, asking them how they had piloted the ship of everybody was unconscious. Reed explains that they simply don’t know, and that they don’t know what happened up there.</p><p>It cuts back to a flashback, and all of them are at the hospital, with Sue and Reed watching over Grimm, who seems to be in an intense state. Reed feels that it’s all his fault, as he had miscalculated, but Sue disagrees, saying that he can’t predict the future, even with a brilliant mind like that. Meanwhile, Johnny is experiencing his powers, as the nurse comments on the thermometer and how it’s broken. In another room, Grimm wakes up and gets into a rage and sees himself. Sue disappears, Reed’s arms stretch and Johnny has flames produced near on his face. Grimm, in a rage, destroys the hospital equipment in a rage. Grimm pushes Reed away, and almost gets crushed by the hospital equipment, but is saved. Reed asks if that’s Sue, and uses his hand to feel for her. Sue says that “that’s not my arm”. Grimm, in a confused state, asks what’s happened to his skin when Johnny flies in with flames all over him.</p><p>At the meeting, a congresswoman comments that Grimm had not been able to reform and wonders if that is a safety concern for the public. Reed says that she has always known him to be a man of his word and promises to use these abilities for good. The congresswoman questions if that doesn’t happen, and Reed replies that he will attempt to address the situation, and adds that they shouldn’t be treated differently, as they have had no criminal records. Sue asks Reed what’s going to happen, and Reed isn’t too sure. As they make their way to the lobby, Reed says that he’s purchased the old Baxter building and asks Sue if she would like to join him. Johnny agrees, and so does Grimm, much like family. As they exit the building, Johnny sings <em>We Are Family</em> and Grimm tells him to shut up.</p>",

To the criminals he terrorizes and the citizens he protects, Fear is a bold, even reckless superhero. To those who know his secret, he’s a man paralyzed by a crippling anxiety disorder, who needs an anti-fear drug to fight his war on crime. But what happens when his supply runs out?   <p>The story begins with Adam Rygert standing atop a building, trying to convince himself he is not afraid. He has a momentary flashback to a childhood birthday partner where he was mortified for being too afraid to jump from the diving board. He overcomes the flash back, puts his helmet on, and lets the mysterious gas run through his helmet and into his breathing area. The gas brings on a change in Adam and he easily dives off the building and flies off. HE comes to the docks and find criminal activity. During the tussle one of the villains cracks his helmet, releasing the gas. He dives out the window and uses an inhaler to get another hit of the gas then enters the battle again. When he succeeds he flies away but one of the nearby homeless people obtain a small portion of his drug and starts to use it.</p> <p>During the news coverage we meet Becky Edwards, a reporter and childhood friend of Adam. She talks highly of Adam's alter-ego Fear; however, she is quickly cut off by a police officer. Adam has another flashback to his childhood with Becky and how he had such a huge crush on her that he missed three days of school after talking to her. Now, however, they are going out and she knows he is secretly Fear. She does seem to question why he thinks it's his responsibility though. He starts to have an asthma-attack and then explains that the town was once safe and he feels he can make it again.</p> <p>He has a final flashback to the day he met Lionel, his tutor that would go on to make the drug he uses as fear. Lionel scolds him for being so careless the day prior. They head into a secret lair where he keeps the drug. He reveals a concern that his time is limited and someday Ryan will need to learn to make the drug. Ryan argues that he should go public with it, but Lionel disagrees saying it may fall into the wrong hands.</p> <p>In another house Victor, the head of the criminal activity in the area, is angered by Fear's action and exclaims he'll need to deal with him personally. A man arrives and says he could help and that he knows Fear's weakness.</p> <p>Back at Adam's mansion, we see that Adam was thrown out of his own restaurant. It is also revealed that his father is deceases and, according to his butler, he is not doing a very good job of living up to his legacy. Becky calls him to give him a tip about some activity. Adam heads out as Fear but this time the villains are actually a distraction. He deals with them very easy. Prior to the battle he had tried to contact Lionel with no luck, so afterward he went to his house to see what had happened. When he arrived, he found the house trashed and a message that said \"I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.\"</p>",

            "description": "<p>Titans Tower is back up and running on the East Coast as Judd Winick, Ian Churchill and Norm Rapmund assemble an explosive new team of Titans under the leadership of Cyborg! But their first mission may be their last as powerful forces gather to destroy all Titans past and future!</p><p>Back during the Teen Titans' original line-up, they faced off against the Joker. He had one of his crazy plans that involved teaming up with Bizarro and kidnapping a female pop singer. Things aren't looking too good but Kid Flash manages to snag the giant gun pointed held at the singer's head away from the Joker. To Wally's surprise, it isn't a normal gun. Inside there is a bomb set to go off. As he runs to move the bomb away from civilians, it goes off 3 seconds early.</p><p>Thinking that Kid Flash is gone, Raven engulfs the Joker inside of her to force him to face his worst fears. It turns out that the Joker's fears don't scare him but rather make him laugh hysterically.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donna and Starfire continue to try to break free of Bizarro's deadly grasp. After Donna gives him a hard kick to the face, Bizarro responds by throwing her far away. Left alone, Starfire thinks about the fact that Bizarro is the opposite of Superman. Knowing that Superman derives his strength from the yellow sun, she surmises that it would have the opposite affect on Bizarro. She creates a sun blast and Bizarro is left withered. He still contains the strength to injure Kory.</p><p>All this has given Kid Flash the time he needed to find some blue Kryptonite from one of the locations that Robin suggested. With Bizarro finally defeated, Robin finishes things by taking Joker out with a haymaker blow. \"Titans Together! Together Forever!\"</p><p>Today. Cyborg is trying to start a new team of Titans. He calls his former teammates but they all have reasons and excuses not to join him. It's Nightwing that finally asks Victor if any of the old team has said yes to him. He also asks who are the new team members.</p><p>The new team consists of Hawk and Dove, Power Boy, Anima, Little Barda, Lagoon Boy, and Son of Vulcan. They are the new Titans East.</p><p>Cyborg has them all assembled together and tells them that they will be judged on how they perform together. Power Boy is a little put off by the fact that they are basically trying out for the team. For their first mission, Cyborg wants them to \"nail [Power Boy's] butt to a wall.\"</p><p>Power Boy sets off. Anima is the first to attempt to grab him. He easily throws her off his back. Next Lagoon Boy grabs hold of Power Boy. Power Boy makes fun of him and holds him in a headlock. Lagoon Boy responds by expanding like a puffer fish, sticking Power Boy in places that shouldn't be mentioned. Little Barda takes her shot by delivering a sharp blow to his head. Slamming down into a tree, Power Boy barely manages to avoid a deadly blow by Vulcan's sword. Power Boy claps his hands together and the shockwave sends Vulcan and Little Barda flying back.</p><p>Hawk and Dove decide to take their turn. As Power Boy swings at Hawk and as she manages to stop his punch, she reveals that she's the one he was with the night before (and had her role play as Supergirl). Hawk's punch sends Power Boy flying into the woods. The team runs towards the trees but it's Dove that makes them stop momentarily. She mentions that they haven't been performing as a team and that is why Power Boy has been avoiding their attacks. Shouting out orders, they coordinate a move to surround Power Boy in the woods.</p><p>To their shock, they find Power Boy, impaled on a tree branch. The tree is smoking with some bits of flame and Power Boy's body is half burnt also. As the rest come to realize that someone else is there, blasts start coming at them. Dove and Little Barda are hit. Vulcan puts up a shield but is still shot through it, at the same time that Lagoon Boy is. Cyborg runs towards them yelling for someone to report what is going on.</p><p>Victor is dismayed to find the entire group lying in smoking heaps on the ground. Knowing that he's got to get medical attention there right way, he looks up to see an enormous fireball coming straight down on top of him.</p><p>All that is left is Cyborg's upper torso in a giant burnt crater. This appears to be the end of the Titans East.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>THIS IS IT! The official continuation of the Angel TV series!</p><p>When last we saw Angel and company, they were charging into battle against Wolfram and Hart's Senior Partners and facing down endless demons in a dark and rainy alleyway. Now, IDW Publishing is proud to present the story of Angel: After the Fall, as presented by Angel co-creator Joss Whedon, with a creative team hand-picked by Whedon himself, the Spike: Shadow Puppets team of Brian Lynch and Franco Urru.</p><p>Picking up where Season Five of the fan-favorite TV show ended, the first issue in this maxi-series looks at who lived after that climactic battle, who died, and what happened to all of Los Angeles in its wake. Acclaimed artist Tony Harris (Ex Machina) and Urru provide special covers for each issue of this momentous series. Issue 1 features a full 27 pages of story and art!</p><p>On a street in LA a girl and two men are looting a store when they're suddenly attacked by a demon. But before the demon can do any harm, Angel appears wielding a sword. He cuts down the attacking demon and starts working on its friends. The demons quickly recover, drop Angel to the ground and start tearing into his body. Things look bad but then out of nowhere a dragon appears and burns the demons to a crisp. Throughout his fight Angel had been recapping the events that brought him to the point he's at now, saying that he'd made some bad choices and ending up working for an evil organization. The dragon had also been part of that organization and two minutes into fighting it he had realized that it had been just as misled as he. Now they work together.</p><p>With the threat dealt with Angel turns his attention to the humans. He tells them to take the car his dragon had brought and head to address he hands them on a slip of paper. The people wonder what's been going on and though Angel knows why the world is as it is, he doesn't tell them. He just hops on his dragon and flies away. As the dragon flies over the city he goes over what he isn't telling anyone. Things are like they are because he and his friends took a stand and Wolfram and Hart sent an army. Both sides suffered losses and Wolfram and Hart sent LA to hell. Now demons ran the city. They had quickly conquered and divided it, and now they owned it, everything but the Wolfram and Hart offices where Angel and his dragon live.</p><p>The dragon reaches their home and Angel tells it to grab some cars for the night rounds. As he goes inside a demon grabs him and slams him into a wall. It's Burge, Lord of Downtown LA and his son. Burge has come because Angel's latest escapade took place in his territory. As Burge's son gets angrier (it was his men who had been killed) he prepares to do something rash when Wesley Wyndham-Price walks through the door. While Burge's son holds Angel, Wesley and Burge have a talk. Wesley says that Wolfram and Hart don't approve of Angel's actions and he will be punished, but not by Burge. Angel's fate isn't up to him and if Angel dies, bad things will happen to everyone else. Burge leaves but swears that if Angel leaves the building again that night or kills any more of his men, he'll be coming back for his head. Or his desk. Burge really likes the desk. Burge's son still wants to kill Angel but since he can't he decides to take a swing at Wesley. The demon is surprised to see that the man is intangible and quickly flies off. When the demons are all gone, Wesley asks Angel how his rounds went and learns that he saved about a dozen people and sent that all to the usual place.</p><p>In Santa Monica the last three people that Angel saved make their way to an old hotel that was apparently where Angel sent them. The two guys are wary of the place, not entirely trusting that Angel was a good guy, but the girl believes he was so they go inside. When they open the doors they see a room full of humanoid demons and people with weapons. The guys really want to leave but before they can lightning fills the air around them. A girl in red appears and tells them they're just trying to see if they're on the up-and-up. The lightning fades and then another girl appears from the darkness and starts smelling them and even licks the girl. She freaks out but Nina (the girl that did the licking) explains that she's a werewolf and since the sun and moon are out all the time in hell, it has an affect on her. From out of the darkness someone else appears and tells Nina and Gwen (responsible for the lightning) to calm down, the new arrivals were sent by Angel so they're good. Then he gives them his name. It's Connor.</p><p>Back and the offices of Wolfram and Hart, Angel is laying on a table with some kind of creature on his chest. Wesley says it's supposed to heal him but Angel is not happy about using it. Angel asks why Wesley wasn't around when he came back and was attacked by Burge and his son, and Wesley said he wanted to see Angel's next move which ended up being \"squirm\". Angel then explains why he couldn't really do anything about Burge. If he killed Burge and his son, every demon would be fighting to take over his position as Lord and numerous humans would die. Angel goes on to say that he wishes he had been able to take out the demons as they popped up, but he had been unable to move for the first few days (or weeks possibly) after LA had been sent to hell. Now all he can do is save small groups of humans (without upsetting the senior partners of Wolfram and Hart). He's working on a plan though, all he needs is the right firepower. Wesley gives a response that tells a little about his position now. He says he'd give anything to leave and be able to move on, indicating that he did die at the end of Angel but the senior partners had prevented his soul from passing on so he could do their work and continue to get Angel to work for them. Then he says that if Angel doesn't get some control, the wrong person is going to. As he says this, Angel is looking at a picture of his \"firepower\", some kind of orb.</p><p>The orb is elsewhere at the moment. Specifically, in the chest in the jelly-like Lord of Westwood. The creature sits on a throne in an arena surrounded by girls, other demons and Betta George, a telepathic fish. On his throne, the Lord of Westwood is yelling idiotically at some humans to get them to fight. When they won't, he orders Betta George to telepathically force them to fight. The fish says he doesn't have that much power so the Lord of Westwood imparts him some power from the orb in his chest and Betta George reluctantly forces the humans to start slaughtering each other. In the middle of the gladiatorial brawl a group of angry, armed and hooded strangers enters the arena. Suddenly a weighted bag slams into George's head knocking him out and the attackers advance upon Lord Kr'ph himself. Kr'ph sends his demon lackeys to fight and they willingly put themselves in harms way for their master, but as one of the attackers says, their fighting ability leaves something to be desired. The attackers easily slice through the demon defenses and amid the fight their hoods are dropped and the leader is revealed to be none other than Gunn. Kr'ph has, at this point, turned from threats to bargaining but Gunn knows what he wants and has no problem taking it. He sticks a hand into Kr'ph and rips out the orb from his dying body. With the main bad guy dead, the other demons fall soon after leaving Gunn and his team standing in a field of corpses. No demons are left so Gunn has his men wrap up the fish and Gunn brings the girls back to wherever \"Team Gunn\" is hiding out.</p><p>Back at the offices of Wolfram and Hart, Angel is putting a sword away when he hears someone or something outside yelling \"six for six\". Apparently it's Burge's son again and he's saying that he gets to kill six humans because Angel killed six of his men. Angel stands on the edge of his building remembering that he was told not to leave and watches the demons circle the humans. As Burge's son is about to kill a human, Angel throws his desk outside as recompense. When the demon flies up at Angel, the man takes out a stake and throws it into his eye, a declaration of war.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Gunn's men are writing something arcane on the walls and body cover the floor. The corpses seem to be the people they saved before and they all have bite marks on their necks. Around the corner, Gunn, now a vampire, is draining one of the rescued girls.</p>",

The leader of the world's deadliest terror organization is also the lawful ruler of Wolverine's old stomping ground: the island nation of Madripoor. Unable to depose her openly, S.H.I.E.L.D. sends in its best man to secretly take her down. His name? Stark...Tony Stark. But with his Extremis powers blocked and his Iron Man armor hovering in orbit for emergencies only, can the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. survive against enemies like Bloodscream and Roughhouse, who've nearly killed Wolverine himself? Wizard's 2007 Writer to Watch, Christos Gage (Iron Man), and in his stunning Marvel debut, artist Harvey Tolibao (Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic), bring you a roller coaster ride of action and espionage that will change Madripoor forever!</em></p><p>Stark briefs SHIELD on Madame Hydra and Madripoor and his plan to enact a regime change. Checking into a Madripoor hotel, Stark is greeted by Madame Hydra who injects him with an Extremis-blocking compound &amp; GPS tracking unit. Before the compound takes effect, Stark disables the GPS, then spurns Madame Hydra's advances. Upset, she kisses a bellboy, killing him whith her poisoned lipstick. Cleaning the room of bugs, Stark and his agents go to Lowtown and start a bar fight where undercover agent Huang tells Stark how to contact Tyger Tiger.</p><p>Bloodscream and Roughhouse attempt to kill Stark and agents but fail, destroying the bar in the process. Madame Hydra arrives, claiming that Huang tried to kill Stark, so she executes him. Returning to the hotel, Stark is attacked by Hydra agents. He and the agents escape using H.A.W.K. suits, leaving a bomb for HYDRA. They set down in the jungle and are found by Tyger Tiger who is initially hesitant to openly challenge Madame Hydra for Madripoor's crown until Stark convinces her to try by showing her a secret Hydra weapons lab.</p><p>Later, Stark confronts Madame Hydra at the Royale Palace, challenging her to a duel and goading her into confessing her contempt for Madripoor in front of a jury-rigged camera that's broadcasting live. Tyger Tiger leads a revolt against Hydra, while Stark calls his armor down from orbit, defeats Bloodscream and Roughhouse as Iron Man, and destroys Hydra's new biological neural-disruptor cannon. Later, Stark congratulates Tyger Tiger on becoming Madripoor's princess, but is called away when Mount Wundagore shows activity.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage of the movie posters for <a href=\"/james-bond/4005-27028/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27028\">James Bond</a>.</li></ul>",

            "description": "<i>Christian/Islamic conflict. Technological revolution. Fear of the end of the world. Sound familiar? It should. But it's not the world of 2007…it's the world of Europe, circa 1000 AD. The world of Brian Wood's brand-new monthly series, NORTHLANDERS. Following the red-hot success of one of last year's most critically-acclaimed books, DMZ, NORTHLANDERS is a fresh take on Vikings.<br /><br /></i> <p><i>NORTHLANDERS tells the epic tale of Sven, an exiled Viking prince who's been living the decadent, high life in Constantinople - the 11th century's answer to Las Vegas - but now must return to the desolate lands of his birth in the frigid islands of the North Sea to reclaim his vast inheritance. Intending only to take his money and run, he finds more than he bargained for as his former family and friends are enslaved at the hands of Gorm, his ruthless uncle. What follows isnot only a bloody quest to free his people, but also a young man's struggle to discover where he belongs in a rapidly changing world…and what awful sacrifices it will take to make a Prince into a King.</i></p> <p><i>NORTHLANDERS has all the cool, modern sensibilities audiences have come to expect from Wood (DMZ, Demo, Supermarket) mixed with the bloody action of 300 and Gladiator. Joining Wood on this epic journey is outstanding newcomer artist Davide Gianfelice and acclaimed cover artist Massimo Carnevale (Y: THE LAST MAN).</i></p>",

As America's premier super-hero team, the Ultimates have been forced to face more trials and tribulations than anyone ever expected during the course of their short time together: a Skrull infiltration, the trial of the Hulk for his murderous rampage, betrayal from within and the invasion of America. Now, no longer under the auspices of S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony Stark is forced to face the reality of his team's newfound freedom. Having gotten his hands on Nick Fury's personal files, Tony sifts through the information Nick has collected about the Ultimates’ adventures and discovers there's been a lot more going on with his team than he ever anticipated. This 32-page special will also include an extra four-page section featuring an all-new story by C.B. Cebulski and superstar Travis Charest.</em></p>",

Return to the original nonstop gore-fest and experience the thrills, gags, and gagging anew, with unexpected new directions, additional scenes, and Bolton's jaw-dropping new paintings.</p><p>Relive the blood-soaked experience of the classic horror film The Evil Dead-from Ash's point of view and with extra scenes! Mark Verheiden (Battlestar Galactica, My Name Is Bruce) scripts this EXPANSION on Sam Raimi's first full-length feature film, putting us right inside Ash's brash mind and giving Evil Dead fans Raimi-approved dialogue and scenes that didn't appear in the original gore-fest. Mark writes, \"With permission from Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, we've expanded the movie, meeting our characters back in their pre-deadite lives and opening up the story to see what happened between the events seen on screen.\" John Bolton (Army of Darkness, Harlequin Valentine) returns to the Evil Dead universe to paint some of the best horror pages of his career--and he's having red bucketfuls of fun in the process!</p><p>This is a four-issue, fully authorized celebration of the original Evil Dead film that started Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell down their paths of gory glory.</p>",

In this startling origin epic, the breathtaking events that ended World War Hulk rocket into this brand-new Hulk title. When one of The Hulk's oldest cast members is murdered, everyone turns to the team of IRON MAN, SHE-HULK and LEONARD SAMSON to solve the grizzly case. All the evidence points to the Hulk as the killer—but {CLASSIFIED}!</i></p><p><i>Join us for a brand--new story and a brand-new team who loves the Hulk as much as you do!</i></p><p>In Dimitri, Russia, Doc Samson and She-Hulk investigate the murder of the Abomination. Whoever got the drop on him was faster and stronger. They showed no mercy and gave him a severe beating. After the Abomination was down, the killer shot him several times with a gun.</p><p>Thunderbolt Ross asks since when has the Hulk used a gun. Maria Hill wonders how it is even possible that the Hulk did it. Iron Man points out that it's only a theory. Samson points out that with all the gamma radiation around, it doesn't seem like it could be anyone else. The giant footprints also point to the Hulk. Although the footprints have turned the ground to glass with all the radiation given off.</p><p>When Samson suggests they exhume the body to further investigate, they are interrupted by the new Winter Guard. Even though they were invited there by the Russian government, they don't care. S.H.I.E.L.D. was invited yet Samson, She-Hulk, and Ross are not agents. Samson finally snaps and punches Red Guardian, telling him to back off. The fight begins.</p><p>The battle is stopped when Thunderbolt Ross fires his gun into the air several times. He tells them that while they were dancing, he found a survivor of the town. A little girl is mumbling the same word over and over in Russian. Iron Man asks what she is saying and Darkstar says she's saying, \"Red.\"</p><p>In the Alaskan Frontier, a lone figure is lying in the snow, wearing nothing but tattered pants. He gets up and sees a huge fire at an oil pipeline just over the hill. He says to himself, \"Rick Jones, what've you gotten yourself into this time?!\"</p><p>At the Gamma Base in Death Valley, Nevada, Ross and Samson enter the base. After going through a ton of security measures, they finally come to the person they came to see. Locked up, Bruce Banner tells them he was wondering when they were going to go to him for help.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>After the spider-bite…before the great responsibility! Meet Peter Parker, “Midtown High’s only professional wallflower,” a hapless young nerd suddenly gifted with great power…no strings attached! Happy at home with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, but plagued by the bullies and mean girls of high school, see what Peter does when the bite of a radioactive spider gives him the strength to take the things he wants. Fame? Money? Fast cars? Girls? This dweeb’s up to his pencilneck in 'em! Surely things can’t suddenly be this easy… It’s a side of Spider-Man’s early life you’ve barely glimpsed, written by David Lapham (Stray Bullets TERROR, INC.) with art by Tony Harris (Ex Machina)! <br /></em> <br />Spider-Man stands in a wrestling ring, holding Crusher Hogan on his backside with one hand, the crowd cheering, looking on amazed. As the onlookers cheer, he thinks of how good his life is, so much better than what it used to be. </p> <p>Peter reflects back on how things were before. In the school halls, Flash Thompson gives Peter a wedgie that looks like it would sting for weeks. Lousy timing comes into play when Peter spots Liz Allen looking towards him. Despite the fact that Liz and Flash are dating everyone says they've been fighting. Peter thinks of asking her out, but he just doesn't have the nerve.  </p><p>At home, Uncle Ben tells Peter that he got him a car. Peter is thrilled until he lays eyes on his not-so-sweet ride. To say the car would need \"a little work\" would be an understatement. The kid already has enough problems at school, he can only imagine the horrors that will await him when he shows up driving a piece of junk.  </p><p>During a visit to a science exhibit, an experiment on radioactivity is being conducted. As the experiment begins, a spider slides down on a web between the path of radioactive rays. The spider bites Peter and it hurts unlike any other spider bite. He thinks of how he got sick and felt bad, and eventually got better. Man, did he get better.  </p><p>Not only did that spider bite transform Peter physically, but it transformed him mentally as well. With newfound confidence he runs along the lockers in the halls, taking Flash by surprise, who is so stunned, he can't even get a hit in, despite Peter taunting him with a freebie. Peter's excitement fades when he realizes that he's still stuck with a car no girl would probably caught sitting next to him in, dead or alive. A prize of $5,000 for anyone that can stay in the ring with Crush Hogan for three minutes could change all of that.  </p><p>Peter enters the wrestling contest, concealing his identity wearing a mask that looks pretty laughable. Even though he looks far from intimidating to Crusher Hogan, Peter easily wins the prize money. In awe at Peter's performance, Monty Caabash makes Peter an offer.  </p><p>Peter drives up to Liz's place, his car all fixed up. He things of knocking on the door to see if she'd like to take a drive but he starts having second thoughts. Peter's begins to feel a buzzing in his head when he's approached by Flash from behind. Flash asks Peter where he got his car. He tells him that he bought it but Flash doesn't believe him. Just then, Liz comes out and says that she didn't want to see Flash after what he did. Flash says that he came by with Peter. Before Flash can go on, Liz says hello to Peter. Peter is so surprised that she acknowledge him he can barely greet her back. Given new confidence, Peter challenges Flash to a race. Flash accepts the challenge.  </p><p>Flash takes the lead and Peter thinks of how he'll probably wind up killed for being so stupid. Peter feels the buzzing in his head just like he did before. He realizes that the buzzing in his head is a warning sign of just how far he can push himself. Peter floors it on the gas, making light of Flash before leaving him in the dust. There's a raccoon running across the street. Peter swerves at just the right moment and goes off to the side of the road, smashing up the right side of his car and damaging the windshield.  </p><p>When Peter comes home, Uncle Ben tries to console him but Peter acts upset to play things off. Even with his powers and new confidence, Peter still feels like a loser. He pulls out the EWO Extreme Wrestling card that Monty gave him and things of a way to change things.    </p>",

            "description": "<p><em>In 1987, Peter Parker followed Wolverine to Russia, who was on the trail of a friend working for the KGB. Realizing that the KGB would eventually kill his friend, Wolverine wanted to put her out of her misery. Peter tried to stop him, but accidentally killed the friend instead. Haunted by his actions, Peter fled home into the waiting arms of Mary Jane.</em></p><p><em>But WHAT IF…Peter never went home? WHAT IF…the Spider never came out of the cold?</em></p><p>A man by the name of Nebo is in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Nick Fury and the Black Widow stand before him. Fury is honored to be standing before this elusive man. He tells the Widow that Nebo trained an female operative named Alex. He makes killers. Nebo denies ever seeing her. Fury quickly points out that he already knows. Normally S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't concerned with his training since they usually end up in the C.I.A. That wasn't the case with Alex's sister, Charlemagne. She went on to work for the KGB. After she tired of that organization, she started killing them off. She hooked up with Wolverine and then Spider-Man got involved. Wolverine tried making Spider-Man go back home but Charlemagne tricked him into accidentally killing her, which is what she longed for. Spider-Man was messed up from causing her death. It's been a year and now Russian agents are dying again with claw marks and webbing left on their bodies. The story unfolds as to how Spider-Man was brought further into this world of espionage.</p><p>As Peter is about to board a plane back to New York, Logan shows him a picture of Alex. He figures helping her would be a way for Peter to redeem himself. The two of them set out to save Alex from some Russian agents. They soon find themselves faced with Fantasma and Crimson Dynamo. Spider-Man tries to stop Crimson Dynamo but his suit is too much. Finally Wolverine makes his way to his back and slices through the power cables of the suit. Not realizing that the suit is powered down, Spider-Man punches him and breaks his neck. Wolverine takes care of Fantasma with his claws. Spider-Man asks if everyone has to die. Wolverine says eventually yeah, but Alex doesn't have to right now.</p><p>After their escape, it seemed that Spider-Man figured if he could keep Alex alive, it would make up for everyone that had to die. He begins training with Nebo and soon expands the abilities of his spider-senses. Nebo learns that he can't even think of attacking Spider-Man without him realizing it. Peter and Alex started growing closer with all the time they spent together. Things didn't let up as the Russian operatives still wanted her dead.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to track money being sent back to Peter's Aunt. Nick asks where the rest of the money they made went. Nebo tells them that with Spider-Man and Wolverine's influence, a lot went to charities and some went to help mutants. The three of them began a mission of doing \"good.\" Nick still doesn't see how all this has escalated the return of the Cold War. It turns out Spider-Man was tired of being on the defensive when it came to Alex's safety.</p><p>Fury tells Nebo he's lucky they grabbed him when they did. The next mission they were to go on has been revealed to be an ambush against them by the old Soviets. Inside a shack, Alex isn't finding much information from the computers there. Wolverine wonders where Nebo is. Spider-Man says he'll show up later. Wolverine starts getting anxious and Spider-Man asks them to get on the floor for a second. The place is under attack. Wolverine asks how they were able to get a drop on them without it tipping off Spider-Man's senses. Spider-Man now stands before a dude with two blades. Webbing is useless as he can easily slice them. Spider-Man surprises him by revealing a gun built into his web-shooters.</p><p>The fun's not over as they sense they are surrounded by snipers. Spider-Man tells the two of them to just stay alive for one more minute. Then a helicarrier arrives. S.H.I.E.L.D. orders the Russians to drop their weapons. A man tells Fury that this doesn't concern them. He tells Fury that they just want Alex dead for state security. Fury offers him something better and reveals that the man with them is the Rook. They decide to hand over Nebo to stop the Cold War. Fury says only if they let the three go. Wolverine is impressed that Peter set this all up. As Nebo is being taken away, he has one thing to say to Peter, he has now become his greatest student.</p><p>Fury decides to let them go too. He says he may even be stupid enough to hire them at some point in the future. Spider-Man hands a old beaten letter to MJ. He says it's too dangerous for him to even put an address on it. It turns out the letter is a goodbye to his old life.</p>",

But after the shocking events of “Messiah Complex,” Cyclops realizes that some enemies need to be dealt with permanently… and the X-Men can never know about it. Enter WOLVERINE, WARPATH, X-23 and WOLFSBANE…X-FORCE.</p><p>At Angel's Colorado Rocky Mountain retreat, Wolverine is visited by Cyclops and Wolfsbane. Cyclops tells him that seventeen hours ago, the leader of the Purifiers, Reverend Matthew Risman, turned himself in to S.H.I.E.L.D. It turns out the Purifiers had a mole inside and they ended up killing sixteen S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. This is the first time they killed humans. The plan was to steal something deadly that could be used against mutants. Cyclops wants Wolverine to re-form X-Force and put a stop to them, permanently. He's tired of sitting back watching mutants die on their doorstep. When Wolverine says he's impressed and asks what Emma thinks about this, Scott replies that she doesn't know about it.</p><p>At Camp Verde, Warpath is preparing a burial for Caliban. He regrets that he died trying to save him. He swears a blood oath that the Purifiers will die for this.</p><p>Wolverine tells Scott that Warpath may be able to make the decision to be on X-Force but Laura doesn't. His whole reason to bring her to Xavier's was so she could learn to be a person. Scott tells him he already asked her. At that exact moment, X-23 is inside the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility checking out the scene. She sees the surveillance footage and gets Risman's scent. She radio's Cyclop and asks what her next move is. Wolverine decks Scott saying she's his responsibility and he should have asked him first. He also says that Rahne can't be in this either. Rahne insists that she needs answers.</p><p>The Purifiers are tracked to the North Dakota Church of William Stryker. Inside they have the body or Nimrod and Bastion. They join the body of Nimrod with the head of Bastion. When it is activated, it immediately detects mutants. Wolverine, X-23, and Warpath are outside.</p><p>It's a slash-fest inside. They soon discover that Risman has Rahne held captive. He tells them to stand down as he holds a gun to her head. Laura says he's bluffing. Before Wolverine can stop her, she makes a move. Seconds later, a gunshot is heard...</p>",

(WORLD WAR HULK) reunite for the best new book of the 21st century. Have you ever wanted to be a super hero? Dreamed of donning a mask and just heading outside to some kick-ass? Well, this is the book for you--the comic that starts where other super hero books draw the line. KICK-ASS is realistic super heroes taken to the next level. Miss out and you're an idiot!</em></p><p>Dave Lizewski lead a typical high school life. He wasn't popular or a geek or class clown. He was just another average student at his high school. He couldn't even strike up a conversation with the girl he liked. His mother died of an aneurysm when he was fourteen and he lived with his dad, who was still having problems coping with her death.</p><p>As an escape, Dave played a lot of video games and was really into comic books. He became so obsessed with comics that he decided that was the career he wanted for himself, even though superheroes didn't really exist in the world.</p><p>One night he decided to put on a costume. He spent the first few weeks walking around on rooftops getting used to the costume and enjoying the thrill of wearing it underneath his clothes. He spent time working out and trying to come up with a name.</p><p>One day he decided to go into action. Seeing some kids spray painting a wall, he felt this was his time. Having courage from wearing a mask and costume, he approached and insulted the three kids. A fight began. Things didn't go so well as Dave ended up getting stabbed.</p><p>Dave struggled to walk home. Crossing the road, he ends up getting hit by a car. He was left with two broken legs and a crushed spine.</p>",

The mad mind of Warren Ellis is once again unleashed on combat magician William Gravel, this time on a full-color, on-going monthly series! Magic. Everyone thought that he was dead, including the Minor Seven, the secret enclave of Britain's Occult Detectives. But Combat Magician William Gravel is very much alive and looking for the answers to how and why his place in the Minor Seven was filled by another and what the secret society is doing with the Sigsand Manuscript, an ancient supernatural text of unparalleled power. In a quiet, country cottage, Gravel will find the first clues to the Sigsand's location and in the darkness of the cottage's basement, a disturbing, unnatural thing that slithered into our dimension by the power of the ancient tome... Brought here from somewhere that mortal man could not possibly comprehend. The kind of magic that can strip the skin from a screaming man's skull, or direct the path of a shrieking bullet through a maze of city streets, striking its target between the eyes with pin-point accuracy. This is not just magic... This is Combat Magic, wielded by Sergeant Major William Gravel, Warren Ellis' cult-hit sensation from the pages of STRANGE KISS and STRANGE KILLINGS, now in his own, ongoing, full-color monthly series! This issue is available with a regular cover by Mike Wolfer, a wraparound by Raulo Caceres, a special Signed Poster edition package with a color poster of the #0 cover signed by artist Mike Wolfer, and also a rare 1-in-15 Black Magic Edition featuring a new cover by Wolfer.</i></p>",

Nina Locke answers the door to find Sam Lesser and Al Grubb, who are concealing a pistol and hatchet respectively. Taking a break from painting the house, Tyler contemplates the other places he would like to be, with Rod Fess in Baja or with his cousin Orin. Kinsey comes to take Tyler and Bode back to work. At the same time Rendell enters the house to find the two assailants.</p><p>The story comes to the present in San Francisco with Tyler Locke standing over an urn at a memorial service. After the service Tyler sits alone as Rod and Orin try to comfort him. His uncle Duncan sits beside him, and Tyler recalls a conversation that his parents had about the family going to Keyhouse if his father died.</p><p>The story returns to flashback as the Locke children near the house. Suddenly a gun shot sounds from within. Tyler peers in a window at Sam holding a pistol. As Al and Sam argue about someone hearing the gunfire, there is a noise outside. Tyler has fallen over and now has full bucket of paint on his foot. Sam goes outside to find a trail of white footsteps leading into the cellar, he does not notice Kinsey and Bode cowering on the roof behind the chimney.</p><p>The story returns to the present with the Lockes entering Lovecraft, Massachusetts. The family finally arrives at Keyhouse.</p><p>Returning to the flashback, Sam follows the trail to find Tyler's shoe, as Tyler stands behind him, brick in hand. Sam turns and shoots, Tyler lunges and tackles Sam as he fires three more shots. With his back to the wall Tyler strikes Sam in the face with the brick. Sam fires again as Tyler hurls the brick into his face. Tyler takes Sam to the ground, knocks the gun away, and beats Sam unconscious with a brick. Gun in hand, Tyler enters the house by climbing a ladder from the cellar. Al is there to meet him and kicks Rendell's body into the cellar. Tyler tries to shoot Al, but there no more bullets. As Al comments on finding his hatchet, Nina uses it to strike him in the head, killing him.</p><p>In the present as Bode tries to retrieve a sword from the wall he notices something lying on the framing above a door. Bode knocks the object down to find that it is a key, and proceeds to use it on the door.</p><p>We now find that Sam is imprisoned. In his cell he talks to his sink of how he was promised a new home, a new face. Suddenly a face appears in the water and says that he has both and that soon he will be released from this place.</p><p>The story returns to Bode opening the door. As he steps through his body falls to the ground and a ghost of him continues forward. Looking down he realizes this and rushes back through the door. His dead body reanimates and he slams the door shut.</p>",

It’s a hard-hitting period-piece, set in the grimy early 70s, where crime, seduction and betrayal go hand-in-hand. And on top of this longer-than-usual length main story, CRIMINAL now features an expanded back-pages section, as well – with articles by Brubaker and other top crime writers, from novelists to screenwriters to comic writers. These noir articles have become a popular piece of the CRIMINAL package, and are something that can only be found in the comics, not in any collections. So please take this SECOND CHANCE IN HELL to find out what everyone’s been talking about!</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>It’s the return of the best-selling comic book series, inspired by Stephen King’s epic The Dark Tower! Gunslinger Roland Deschain has seen the death of his lover Susan Delgado. And the Big Coffin Hunters who burned her at the stake are now in pursuit of Roland and his ka-tet Cuthbert and Alain. The friends are forced to flee into the desert with the deadly posse in hot pursuit….and Roland is in a coma! Don’t miss this opening chapter starring the Gunslinger whose quest for the Dark Tower will shake the foundation of reality itself!</p><p>After battling in Eyebolt Canyon, in The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born, the young trio of Gunslingers must flee with haste and return home to Gilead.</p><p>However, before leaving, Roland stops in town to collect the remains of his fallen lover, Susan Delgado, from atop the Reap Night Bonfire. Suddenly, Roland yells, “It’s all your fault,” and shoots. Cuthbert, believing that Roland is shooting at Alain, tackles Roland to the ground but Alain recognizes Roland’s true target, the sphere known as Maerlyn’s Grapefruit; or rather, whoever may have been watching through it.</p><p>Unlacing the bag that contained the sphere, Alain peered in to survey the damage caused by Roland’s well-placed bullet.</p><p>To his bewilderment, the fragments of the shattered sphere had begun to re-form into an eyeball shaped creature. Alive and growing, the creature lashed out and attached itself to Roland’s face. Cuthbert and Alain struggled and finally removed it, the creature returning to its original form, but it was too late, Roland’s mind was already trapped inside Maerlyn’s Grapefruit. Alain tries to use his touch to release Roland but the spheres grasp is strong and trouble, in the form of the Hambry posse, is closing in fast. Picking up Roland’s body, the two Gunslingers run to their horses.</p><p>Gaining some distance by killing Clay Reynolds’ horse, Cuthbert and Alain move off onto a rocky path and follow it to a river. Cuthbert, in a prideful moment and against Alain’s warnings, jumps into the river in an attempt to ford it and is swept away in its strong current. Screaming for help and rushing towards a waterfall, Cuthbert is able to catch hold of a strong branch held out to him by Alain.</p><p>Meanwhile, unbeknownst to anyone, as the posse from Hambry follows the trio of Gunslingers, Sheemie follows the posse. However, being half-witted and troubled with guilt, Sheemie looses the posse’s trail and finds himself at an old run-down building with the sign, “Welcome to the Dogan,” across a fence. Unaware of the impending danger, Sheemie ducks under the fence, crosses to the building and climbs down its latter. Upon reaching the bottom, Sheemie finds a mummified corpse and, what with not being too bright, he spends the next twenty minutes trying to talk to it. Involved in his task at hand, Sheemie never even saw the robot in the corner until it was too late. “Sheemie wants to scream. But you know how sometimes you’re so damned scared that your throat closes up and no matter how much you want to, you can’t make a sound except a terrified squeak? It’s just like that.”</p><p>Additional Content: Welcome To The Dogan, Part I: The Ghostly Queen.</p>",

The future of mutantkind starts here!</p><p>“Messiah CompleX” changed the X-Men forever. But no one’s world has been rocked as hard as Cable, the time-traveling mutant from the future. He’s been charged with the one mission that could save all of mutantkind -- or, if he fails, Spin it swirling into extinction. And hot on his trail is a relentless enemy who won’t stop until blood is spilled. No matter where…or when…Cable runs. Brought to you by the dynamic team of Duane Swierczysnki (MOON KNIGHT ANNUAL) and Ariel Olivetti (PUNISHER WAR JOURNAL).</p><p>Don't miss \"Cable # 1\"</p><p>In New Jersey in the year 2043 A.D. Cable stands facing the New York City. He comes across a masked man carrying a gun asking for a toll. He tells him that nothing is free in Jersey. As he makes conversation, he notices two other armed men nearby watching them. He gathers by the amount of weaponry they have that they must be amateurs. He offers his knife as payment, The real intention was to be a distraction. He takes out the first man and tries using him as a shield but gets clipped by a sniper. He takes him out and the third man. He notes that things were too close and checks on the baby he's carrying on his chest. She looks up at him and is doing fine, except she needs a diaper change.</p><p>Cable and the baby have been traveling for five months. They've made their way from Scotland to here. He thinks how the baby cries a lot now and how she didn't so much in the beginning. He thinks back to when he liberated her from the hospital and fought against everyone to \"save\" her. He knows the baby will be the one to save them all someday. Until that day comes, he has vowed to watch over her.</p><p>The two of them go out to find something to eat. He covers her up as he approaches an old diner. Inside, someone is wearing a watch with an X symbol on it. The person thinks that the time is approaching and he won't hesitate this time. He pulls out a gun and aims it at the door just as Cable walks in. Cable sees the gun too late. He turns to protect the baby and gets hit. The shot sends him flying through the window. As he lies on the ground, the man that shot him is announces to everyone that his name is Lucas Bishop and he is a cop. Looks like he got himself a new metallic arm, just like Cable.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Writer/creator Wayne Osborne and artist John Byrne present FX, an all-new, six-part series introducing a new hero for the ages. Struck down by a mysterious accident, Tom Talbot awakens to find that playing pretend has suddenly become all too real. He now has power limited only by his imagination-but will it be enough to stop the savage Silverback? Comic legend Byrne provides a cover and pencils and inks for the entire series.</i></p><p>Tom and Jack are best friends playing in the park. They have sticks and are pretending to be knights. Jack gets away and hides in a tree. As Tom searches for him a bright light appears and zaps him. Momentarily stunned, Tom is unable to dodge a blow by Jack and is hit in the head. He gets knocked out.</p><p>At the hospital, the doctor talks to Tom's parents. He says he should be fine and isn't sure why he hasn't woken up yet. Mr. Talbot is yelling unreasonably and his wife convinces him they should go down to the cafeteria for a bit. As they leave, Jack asks if he can see Tom. After a scolding by Mr. Talbot, he goes in and sits next to Tom. He talks to him and finally Tom wakes up.</p><p>A few days later, the boys are outside the apartment despite Talbot's \"orders\" that he stay in bed. They begin playing and talk about blasting any bad guys that might come upon them. Tom pretends to have a bazooka and suddenly a yellow constructed one appears on his shoulder. He accidentally blows up a garbage dumpster. The boys take off to hide in the park.</p><p>Not knowing what's going on, Tom decides to try something else. He holds out his hand and pretends to have a blaster. Saying \"ZZZT\" he shoots a tree down. Jack insists Tom is a superhero now and tells him to try something bigger. Tom thinks then imagines a rocket. He takes off but becomes shocked and loses his concentration. Tom begins falling but conjures up an aircraft at the last moment. After he catches his breath, he tries several more types of vehicles.</p><p>The next day, Tom shows Jack the costume he made. He wears a hooded sweatshirt with iron-on letters \"F X,\" a mask, gloves and camouflage pants. He sticks them in his book bag.</p><p>At school, Tom runs into the girl he has a crush on, Raye. He asks if he can borrow her English notes since he's missed some school. Ace, the school bully, shoves Tom into a wall for \"playing out of [his] league.\" Angry, Tom manages to momentarily restrain himself until they walk away. He thinks up a bowling ball and knocks Ace down. Raye yells at Ace and asks if he simply can't walk and talk at the same time. She tells him she wonders why she's going out with him at times.</p><p>On a field trip to the zoo, the boys head over to get a look at Silverback. An announcement goes over the speakers asking all patrons to not make sudden movements or loud noises. Silverback, a huge gorilla, is being transported. He is chained and cuffed and followed by several armored guards. As they prepare to move him into the back of an armored truck, he breaks free. The boys are thrilled by this.</p><p>Dressed as FX, Tom gets Silverback's attention by jumping on him in the shape of a big lion. Thinking he needs to be careful not to hurt Silverback, Tom finds this won't be as easy as he thought. Silverback yells out \"Free!\" and plows through the guards. One notes that their tranqs aren't working and he feels that they were set up.</p><p>Jack checks on FX as Raye comes up and asks if he knows him. Jack plays off not knowing him when Silverback grabs the \"pretty\" and walks away. FX flies after him. He makes machine guns to take him out. Tom now finds himself falling again. He apparently can only create one item at a time.</p><p>Having Silverback's attention, FX is now in his sites. He says he's going to hurt him since he was hurt. Taking a beating and begging Silverback to stop, he tries one last thing. He pictures a cybernetic-type arm and delivers a forceful blow that knocks out Silverback.</p><p>That evening the news reports the heroic deed of a new Super Hero named FX. A package arrives for Tom. He opens it to find a new professional looking costume. Jack remarks that now he can get rid of his cheap-o one. Tom is more concerned by the fact that this means someone knows about him. Jack finds a card with an address. Tom says he'll check it out later. Putting the costume on, he takes off flying over the city.</p><p>Elsewhere, FX is being watched by a mysterious hooded figure with a skull face...</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Written by Mike Costa; Art by Fiona Staples; Cover by Cully Hamner</p><p>A new 6-issue miniseries shedding light on the mysterious Authority member, featuring art by Koi Turnbull (HEROES VOL. 1 HC, SUPERMAN CONFIDENTIAL) and covers by Cully Hamner (BLUE BEETLE)! Before he was recruited into StormWatch, Jack Hawksmoor was a solitary urban hero, misanthropic and alone. While preventing a massive robot attack on the Golden Gate Bridge, Hawksmoor gets unexpected assistance from a woman he has more in common with than he realizes, then later stumbles upon a locked-room murder mystery. On top of all this, his city-born powers have been acting up — and he has a gumshoe's suspicion that all this may be connected.</p><p>In the city Kiev located in the Ukraine a Slavic god is attacking the capital city. Jack Hawksmoor noticed it before even the Carrier picked it up and now the whole of The Authority has come to deal with it. The team approaches it and can hear it talking but The Engineer can’t translate what it’s saying. The Doctor then says that no one can because it comes from a time when language and culture were inextricably linked. Swift flies by and makes that comment that she can read the date on the quarter from two miles away but looking at the giant god is giving her a headache. Apollo notices that it seems to be shifting in and out of this plane of existence and Midnighter gripes that there will be nothing to hit. Just then the enormous deity raises his hand and something happens that sends half the city back into the eight century. Jenny Quarx is standing on a nearby building but is unable to help the team because the god seems to be affecting her physically just by being there. The Engineer sees what the god did to the city and sends Jack to check for causalities.</p><p>Down below Jack sprints through the city and notes only a few injuries. He thinks to himself that he can feel every hear beat in three square miles but the loudest is the city’s itself and it’s racing. Jack finds a man half buried beneath fallen cinderblocks and asks the blocks to dissolve off the man. Nothing changes and Jack asks Kiev if it can hear him. When he gets no response he tells Jenny that the city isn’t responding to him and after he manually removes the cinder blocks he goes to see what happened to the part of the city that got taken away. As he runs he feels as if something is blocking the city from hearing him. He keeps going and when he steps onto the grass of the part of the city that’s in the past his brain is affected and he drops to the ground.</p><p>Up in the sky Apollo drops Midnighter so he can circle the god and superheat the moisture in the air which will hopefully break up the storm the thing seems to be connected to and hurt it somehow. He doesn’t get very far though because the god sees him and strikes him down with a lightning bolt. Back on the ground Jack is awake but crippled from the waist down. He tries to tell a building in the city to catch Apollo but it doesn’t respond and when the solar powered superhero crashes debris flies everywhere. Jack tries to protect some civilians and as everything fades to black he remembers the last time a city didn’t listen to him.</p><p>It’s 1994 in California and Jack Hawksmoor is leaping over to a giant robot that looks like it’s attacking the Golden Gate Bridge. In midair Jack smells what the thing is made of, normal metals and something more exotic. He bounds from the bridge and increases his density hoping to hit the robot with enough force to damage it or knock it over but instead he just ricochets off towards the bridge again and crashes onto the hood of a woman’s car. Jack gets up and has a brief word with the woman. The sight of her seems to stumble him and her perfume makes his head go light. Once he gathers his wits he jumps on a cable on the bridge and reassess the situation. He now knows that he’s not hard enough to hurt the robot so he looks for something he can. He calls to the ruins of the quake of 1906 that are at the bottom of the bay and has them form a fist. Before he can use it to smash the robot though, the thing spins around and blasts away the fist. Then it turns its guns on Jack and fires. Jack jumps out of the way and onto the robots gun arm but the cables he was holding onto are shot in half. When Jack lands on the robot he feels the heat from the gun and it burns away parts of the legs of his favorite suit just by being near it. He changes tactics and has the ruins in the bay spin to cause a giant wave. Before the wave hits he tells everyone on the bridge to get into their cars and moments later the wave knocks the robot into the bridge and fills it with seawater. Jack jumps back onto the robot and starts punching his way into it to find its pilot. Inside the robot is what appears to be a blue man in an old English outfit. The pilot doesn’t surrender so Jack rips off one of its enormous shoulder guns and threatens him some more. At that moment the strain of having caught the robot and taking the huge wave causes the base of the bridge to crack. Jack orders it to increase its density, fix itself and not break again. Jack sees more damage though and realizes that he needs to end things quickly so he can give the bridge more attention. He calls the ruins once again and has them hold the robot’s legs and then tells one of the bridge’s cables to snap. When the cable breaks it whips out and cuts off the robot’s head. The rest of the machine sags but doesn’t fall and Jack starts ripping into it. From another point on the robot that Jack can’t see, the pilot escapes onto the bridge and makes a run for it. It seems like he’ll escape when from out of nowhere the girl whose car Jack landed on appears and decks the pilot. Jack drops down onto the bridge and asks her where she learned to throw a punch like that. She says she does Tae Bo but Jack is looking her over again and feels like there’s something off about her. He asks her if she’s completely human and she says no. Jack turns to the bridge for some quick repairs and she tells him that she tried out for Stormwatch but got cut in the second round. Jack hears the police coming and prepares to leave. As he jumps away she tells him her name is Juliet and he apologizes about her car. Jack thinks to himself that Juliet will be trouble so he decides to forget all about her.</p><p>Later that night Jack is flipping through the city and thinking to himself. He never sleeps but there’s a part of his brain that’s never really awake, it just resonates in a frequency above consciousness. It’s the closest he comes to dreaming and that’s where the city speaks to him. He keeps moving through the city and thinks more about his abilities. He can smell every dog park in the city, radio transmissions crawl into his head from all over America, he knows the dates on the newspapers burning in the trash, he lives on pollution and his heart has been replaced with a magnet for trouble. Right then he feels a pull and goes to check it out. Two older teens have cornered a young girl and when one pulls a knife Jack drops the ladder of an apartment’s emergency stairs on his head. He grabs the other one by the collar and drags him up on the roof. He’s about to tie him to something when he gets another alert. Instead he threatens the thug and throws him off the building, purposely breaking his leg.</p><p>Jack skips over to Pacific Heights and goes to house where he knows something bad just happened even though the city won’t tell him what. Jack smells something burnt but knows it wasn’t a gun. He finds he body of a man in the kitchen and can tell he died around an hour ago and he finds the source of the burn smell to be the hole in the man’s chest. Jack can’t feel anything else though. The rest of the place gives him static and the TV and windows won’t show him what happened. He can tell things about the house, but doesn’t know anything else about the murder. He finds a door that he doesn’t already know what lies behind it and goes inside. In the room he finds lots of blueprints for San Francisco going back to at least 1897. He says that looking at city blue prints always makes him feel like looking at a sister naked. It freaks him out. Suddenly he hears a key in the lock of the front door. The fact that he didn’t feel the person coming tells Jack that whoever it is, is being sheltered by the same informational black hole as the mans killer and so Jack thinks the person is probably connected to the murder. Jack hides behind the door and after the person calls inside for “Ben”, in walks Juliet.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>SECRET INVASION IS HERE!! Years in the making, months in the teasing...and it all STARTS HERE!! The shape-shifting alien race known as the Skrulls has secretly infiltrated every super-powered organization on Earth with one goal...full-scale invasion! In this DOUBLE-SIZED first issue, page after page unveils reveal after reveal and shocking moment after shocking moment! Brian Bendis and Leinil Francis Yu leap off the pages of mega-hit New Avengers and deliver a story that will change the Marvel Universe forever. THE MARVEL UNIVERSE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!!!!!!!</i></p><p>Iron Man shows the dead Elektra Skrull to Mr. Fantastic and Hank Pym, saying that they are the smartest guys on the planet. He fills them in on what's been going on and even says that he can't even be sure if they are who they say they are.</p><p>On the Earth orbiting headquarters of S.W.O.R.D., Commander Dugan pays them a visit. While there, a red alert sounds off signaling the arrival of an alien spacecraft heading directly towards Earth. Agent Brand recognizes it as a Skrull ship. It crashes in the Savage Land. Brand calls Stark.</p><p>Back in Stark's lab, he tells Richards and Pym that this is a new type of Skrull, completely undetectable. They prepare to examine the body to discover how it could have been undetectable when he receives the call and leaves.</p><p>Iron Man tries assembling the Mighty Avengers. The only one there is Spider-Woman. He tells her about the crash and says to gather everyone to the quinjet on the roof. As Jarvis goes about his duties, Spider-Woman makes a call to Luke Cage. She tells him to get a head start to the Savage Land since she trusts him more than she trusts Stark. Luke asks the others if they're ready to piss off everyone. They are.</p><p>Arriving at the Avengers Tower rooftop, the Secret Avengers find the Black Widow there. Spider-Man webs her up while Ronin throws his nun-chucks at her, knocking her out. They proceed to steal the quinjet.</p><p>When Iron Man and the others arrive a few minutes later, Stark isn't too happy. They still cannot make a safe landing in the Savage Land as a huge dinosaur takes a bit out of the quinjet. On their way to the Skrull crashsite, they pass by the base they had their first battle. The place is a smoldering wreck. They don't bother checking what happened there since that's not what they came for.</p><p>They find the crashed Skrull ship. Wolverine can't smell anything since it's sealed shut. They debate whether or not to open it since it could either contain an army of Skrull soldiers or could contain prisoners with answers. Before they can do anything, the other Avengers arrive.</p><p>Luke says he's going to open it. Iron Man raises his hand but Luke tells him his suit can't hurt him. As soon as the door is pried open, Dugan says, \"He loves you...\" A bomb destroys the S.W.O.R.D. headquarters. Jarvis pulls out a disc and uploads an alien virus. The virus compromises Iron Man's suit. He falls to the ground seemingly in pain. The S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier has lost complete power and is falling towards the city. The virus spreads throughout all of Stark's facilities. The superhuman prison, the Raft loses complete power and the prisoners are free from their cells. The same happens at the Cube and Noh-Varr, a.k.a. Marvel Boy is free. At Thunderbolt Mountain Norman Osborn's computer starts to fizzle and an explosion knocks them all out. Songbird looks up and sees Captain Marvel arrive. At the Baxter Building, a Skrull posing as a tourist changes into Sue Storm and manages to gain access to the private elevator. She walks past Johnny, Franklin and Valeria and heads into Reed's lab. Compromising the portal to the Negative Zone, \"she\" simply says \"He loves you...\" as a big chunk of the Baxter Building is ripped into the Negative Zone.</p><p>Back in the Savage Land, the Mighty Avengers try tending to Tony Stark. He's having a seizure. They discuss what to do when their attention is drawn to the Skrull ship. Emerging from the ship is a band of Earth heroes including Spider-Man, Beast, Thor, Luke Cage, Jean Grey, Invisible Woman, Iron Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and others. The Wolverine from the ship says he knows who he is and asks who they (the Avengers) are supposed to be.</p><p>In Earth's orbit, Agent Brand tries calling the helicarrier. Their escape-globs only have about ten minutes left of oxygen. Not getting a response, she sees an armada of Skrull ships heading their way.</p><p>In Stark's lab, Reed thinks he has discovered how the Skrulls were able to go undetected. He's about to inform Pym, who holds an alien gun to him, saying he already knows how. He shoots Reed, transforms into a Skrull and says, \"He even loves you.\"</p>",

            "description": "<i>In the wake of Messiah CompleX, there are no X-Men and young mutants Rockslide, Blindfold and Dust are alone and directionless. Until the day Cyclops recruits them to hunt the new incarnation of the Brotherhood – and kill them. Joined by a pair of new recruits, the young X-Men learn a hard truth about the world post-Messiah CompleX: sometimes old allies make for deadly enemies.</i><br/><br/> <p>The story Begins with a dream with the Young X-men fighting Donald Pierce. Wolf Cub and Rockslide are just rambling on about not calling Wolf Cub by his name. Then they tell Dust to rip off his skin and she does. Now, his metal part of him is showing. Blindfold is walking to towards the battlefield with Greymalkin. Blindfold is worried and she says and I quote: \"I've seen this before. Pierce is going to kill--NO...\". We are now shown Pierce slashing someone with his metal claws and a Young X-men is dead. We are not shown which one it is though. Blindfold awakes in her aunt home (Which is shown to be in Prospect Plains, New jersey)and it is shown that it was her dream. We are now taken to Erfurt, Germany to meet the future Young X-men member, Wolf Cub.</p> <p>For some odd reason it seems Wolf Cub is acting more like Wolverine by Calling Maximus Lobo \"Bub\", who is now depowered thanks to M-day. Maximus asks Wolf Cub, \"What do you want from me......Mr. Gleason?\". Wolf Cub responds by saying \"Revenge\". Right when Wolf Cub is about to kill Maximus, Cyclops stops him. Cyclops says that if Wolf Cub wants to hurt someday, that he should come with Cyclops and he'll point him at the right target. Our next member is Dust. Who is protecting a city in Bakwa, Afghanistan from some normal bad guys. One of them challenges her and she shows him that she is not playing around by ripping off the skin from his hand. The people of the city cheer for her and some guy name Zabul (Who looks like a general) comes up to her and says thanks, but also asks her where she is heading. Dust isn't sure and this is where Cyclops comes in and says \"Westchester's lovely this time of year.\".</p> <p>Now, Blindfold is at the ruins of the mansion, but unknown to her, someone is watching her from a far. It seems to be Greymalkin. Next member is Ink and he is at LA Jolla, California. In a Tattoo store that is called, INK.INC. In the store he is getting a tattoo on his hand. While this happens, two officers come in and says that Ink (His name is Eric Gitter by the way) Heisted a Woman's car. They start saying the police motto when they are about to arrest him and he just continues on talking to the tattoo guy. They are finally finished and the tattoo on Ink hand is a Radiation symbol. He says that he wants to test it out and sticks his hand on the officer and the cop goes down puking. Ink is then arrested by the other cop. Now in jail, a cop comes toward Ink and unlocks the bars keeping him inside. The cop is then revealed to be Cyclops. The next member is Rockslide. But, Blindfold seemed to beat Cyclops to it and she is already there talking to him in a coffee restaurant. She tells him about the new team of X-men that he is going to be part of the new group. Cyclops come forth and says that he's been here for about 15 minutes and they hadn't noticed.</p> <p>Cyclops then says that he had hope Rockslide had a better sense of his surrounding. And then says: \"What if I was an enemy?\". Rockslide then says \"What if? I'm like indestructible, bro.\" Cyclops smiles and on the next page Rockslide is shown to be hit by an optic blast and he hit through the window. Cyclops says that he wants Rockslide to be on his team. Rockslide asks about Blindfold and Cyclops says \"Not part of the plan. I'm sorry Ms. Aldine.\" Rockslide then defends her and says: \"Her and me or no me, man.\" With all the Young X-men (Except Greymalkin)members at the danger cave, Cyclops explains how they are the last generation of mutants and who their new enemy is. The New Brother-Hood of Mutants. The leader is Lord Imperial(Sunspot) of the hellfire club. Cyclops actives a hologram projector and Cannonball, Magma, Moonstar and Lord Imperial are shown. Cyclops explains that his former teammates have joined him.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>A new team of Titans is born in the extra-sized first issue of a new ongoing monthly by Judd Winick (GREEN LANTERN, GREEN ARROW, OUTSIDERS), Ian Churchill and Norm Rapmund (SUPERGIRL, TEEN TITANS EAST SPECIAL)! Someone or something is continuing its attack on anyone who's ever been a Titan, including Nightwing, Starfire, Donna Troy, Beast Boy and Raven.</em></p><p><em>You won't want to miss this new startling chapter in Titans history that may forge a new team from the ashes of old, dead friends.</em></p><p>Leaping across the Gotham skyline during the day, Nightwing is on his way to one of the 12 safehouses Batman has peppered all across the city, musing that even though Gotham is a terrible city, he still loves it. As he begins to head to take a nap, his instincts kick in and he narrowly escapes being caught in an explosion. Dick manages to slow his fall using a batarang and grabbing a US flag and is still stunned and in disbelief that someone found out about the safehouses. He lands in an dark ally where he is surrounded by a variety of masked ninjas, no longer surprised.</p><p>At the home of the Animal Man in San Diego, Starfire flies around the backyard happily stark naked holding a towel towards the pool. She thinks about how nice the Bakers have been to her as of late but she still appreciates having the house alone to herself, able to go about her business naked, human prudishness still confusing her. She simply can't grasp why a culture preoccupied with sex are put off by nudity and assumes that it's only the United States that has this problem. She begins to sunbathe to rejuvenate her powers even further when Buddy Baker's son, Cliff, walks in from his soccer game. Kory is midly surprised that he is home early and promises to cover up when she takes notices that Cliff is freaking out about something behind her. After looking backward, Kory gets up to her knees and covers her chest, with a scream.</p><p>At James Madison High School, Raven is walking down the hallways with two girl classmates. Raven cynically and blatantly refuses to help them cheat on a test. When questioned, she gives them a list, insulting them both at the same time. They reach the stairs and the two girls who claim to be Raven's friends, tell her that everyone thinks she is a female dog. Raven admits that she is okay with that and again insults them. When one of the girls is going to tell Raven off, Raven senses another presence and turns to see a demonic fire-breathing warthog, telling the other girls to run.</p><p>In Washington, D.C. at along the National Mall, Red Arrow is riding to the Hall on his motorcycle and is called, yet again, by the nanny watching his daughter, Lian. Shocked upon learning what Lian did this time, Roy asks to talk to her on the phone. He begins to reprimands her for putting a waffle in the DVD player but is then almost speared when bony spikes erupt from the ground all around him randomly, obviously trying to do him harm.</p><p>In Prague, Czech Republic at the headquarters of the Doom Patrol, Beast Boy is woken up from his sleep and is very upset. As leader of the Doom Patrol, he gave the orders that they would let him sleep for one hour unless the mansion was on fire or Darkseid attacked the Earth. Talking on the phone with an unknown, Gar is about to vent but noticing lava raining down around him, looks up and yells an obscenity. He morphs into a flying squirrel to escape his room.</p><p>Seemingly in outer space but actually in the Multiverse, Donna Troy kindly explains to her partner, Kyle Rayner, in a force bubble that as much as she would like to go back to Earth they have to grin and bear it and get to the bottom of things. Kyle protests saying they volunteered to go the Multiverse, so theorhetically they can un-volunteer themselves or at least take a break. Kyle notices something is wrong and gasps, alerting Donna. Donna spins around to see a dimensional gateway open up with red little tendrils and tentacles trying to reel them in. Donna quietly admits that going home is a good idea which Kyle replies sarcastically as he struggles to resist.</p><p>In Keystone City in the home of The Flash, a tired Flash accepts his wife's invite for dinner and tells her to give him a minute to shower. Wally asks what's for dinner hoping that it's not pasta salad. He feels something odd touch his body and looks down to see some sort of red material crawl up his feet that eventually tries to cover his whole body.</p><p>Just outside Titans Tower in the San Francisco Bay, Robin organizes a training session some time after assisting the other heroes with the Sinestro Corps. and defeating their evil future counterparts. The others, especially Kid Devil and Ravager complain but Robin thinks that they need to learn some team maneuvers. He is cut off when a giant monster of Earth attacks them that makes Ravager's day.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in Gotham, Nightwing continues to fight the ninjas and despite some bleeding cuts on his face is winning. With the customary playful superhero banter, he asks them who they are and why are they doing this. He tries to throw a lady ninja by her head but only her mask comes off to reveal a demon with decaying eyes and tongue and incredibly sharp teeth. Nightwing slays her by throwing a sword through her head, literally adding insult to injury. The last ninja demon is taken out by Batman. Nightwing claims he could've taken him out but Batman admits that he is right but he was trying to save some time. He reveals that his teammates have been trying to reach him but they couldn't get in touch with him so they called Batman. Nightwing tells Batman that he doesn't have teammates anymore to which Batman replies that something has happened and the someone who is responsible thinks differently and that it's only begun.</p><p>Back on Titans Island in New York, Power Boy, badly burnt, is still hanging on a tree, speared through the chest. One of the former Teen Titans ask why is Power Boy is still on the tree to which another explains that they wanted to preserve the scene until they got there and the former Titan then announces that he needs to be off the tree and covered since they're here. Somebody asks about Vic who is put in a rejuvenation chamber, the lower half of his body gone, unconscious and stable. Hawk and Dove are stable too. Son of Vulcan, Lagoon Boy and Anima are comatose while Little Barda is critical. And Power Boy is dead.</p><p>The Titans except for Kyle gather around the crime scene where the slaughter of the new Titans East team was. Wally asks who did this. Dick asks him if he means who is trying to eliminate everyone who was a Teen Titan. Donna adds that it is someone with a really big reach, Kory adding vicious to Donna's statement. Gar comments that this someone has to be cunning too. He admits that he almost bought it, revealing that it was very real. Roy adds that it was supernatural since it couldn't been scientific or related to metahumans. Dick asks Raven if it is who he thinks it is. Raven replies with a yes and that Trigon has returned.</p>",

In Civil War: Choosing Sides, five stories shine a spotlight on the wildcards and impact players whose part in the Civil War has yet to be told - including Daredevil/Iron Fist, U.S.Agent, the Irredeemable Ant-Man, Venom and even... Howard the Duck? Then in Winter Soldier: Winter Kills, James Buchanan Barnes, Captain America's one-time partner Bucky, faces his first Christmas of the 21st century - and the truth of the terrible things he was forced to do as the Winter Soldier. And with Cap caught in a conflict he can neither take a side of - or understand - what moves can he make to try to redeem himself? Later, in Civil War: The Return, two of the universe's greatest heroes are confronted with pasts they can't leave behind in two heart-rendering tales. On Earth, the Sentry confronts his inner demons as the shadows of past and future battles tear him apart. Within The Negative Zone, the walls of 42 are pulled back to reveal the return of one of the Marveldom's greatest heroes. And in She-Hulk, Civil War threatens the rights of every American super hero. So whose side will Marvel's top superhuman lawyer fight for? And how can she possibly choose, when she feels one way as She-Hulk, and another as Jen Walters?

            "description": "<p><em>Carlos LaMuerto, a.k.a. Black Tarantula, is finally doing something good with his life. Well, at least it ain’t all bad. Lying low after getting out of prison and wiping out an entire gang, Carlos has become a low-key Robin Hood -- cleaning up the neighborhood he used to run as a gang lord. But he’s about to discover that leaving his past behind isn’t as simple as a change of attitude…as ghosts from his former life haunt him, Carlos turns to his friend/adversary, Matt Murdock.</em></p><p><em>Now Black Tarantula and Daredevil must work together to save the streets of Hell’s Kitchen from a powerful new gang from Carlos’ homeland.</em></p><p><em>SPOILERS</em></p><p>Alleged Recent Unregistered Activity:</p><p>• Daredevil crashed the Hood and Fear's meet and engaged Fear in an extremely violent conflict. Fear was easily bested physically, but there is no cure for Milla Donovan's conditionof madness inflicted by Fear. While Fear was locked away in Ryker's, Milla was committed to a long-term care facility in an effort to find some way to reverse the effects of Cranston's toxins.</p><p>• Carlos LaMuerto, a.k.a. the Black Tarantula, was once the latest supervillain/crime boss in a long line of supervillain/crime bosses. After run-ins with Spider-Man and Daredevil that eventually left him in prison, LaMuerto turned his life around and went to work for Dakota North (on a recommendation from Matt Murdock) after his release. It wasn't long before he took a more \"active\" role in crime-fighting, adopting his Black Tarantula persona again, only now as a vigilante.</p><p>Current Activity</p><p>• In a move reminiscent of Daredevil's now-legendary \"Kingpin\" incident, Black Tarantula has banned drugs in his neighborhood and takes the fight to some schoolyard dealers that leaves them in traction.</p><p>• The next morning, LaMuerto spots his estranged wife and son on a crowded street, but loses them amidst the chaos. Later that evening he gets a call from his son who is being held hostage. Walking into the obvious trap, LaMuerto finds himself at his odds with his own Argentinean gang from years ago, led by his cousin Luis.</p><p>• Luis has come to steal the Black Tarantula birthright and return it to \"greatness\" by once again flooding the streets with drugs and generally being a supervillain/crime boss. Before Luis can perform the necessary ritual, LaMuerto escapes his captors and flees to the doorstep of Matt Murdock.</p><p>• Three days later, Black Tarantula and Daredevil move on Luis's pier. LaMuerto finds his \"family\" only to discover they're actually innocents drugged and forced to pose as his family as bait. In the ensuing battle, Daredevil makes short work of most of Luis's goons, and LaMuerto (after surviving an explosion and severe burns) kills his cousin.</p><p>• Knowing there will be more men coming to steal his power and destroy his streets, LaMuerot strikes a deal with Daredevil. In exchange for the Devil's silence, LaMuerto will keep a low profile and wait for the other shoe to drop in this particular piece of madness in hopes of putting a stop to it once and for all.</p><p>A Regular Robin Hood—Though his methods are brutal, LaMuerto is indeed makes a profound impact on his community, and perhaps more importantly, finds peace within himself after a lifetime of misery and corruption.</p><p>The Family Business—At one time, the Black Tarantula was believed to be immortal. We know now that the mantle of Black Tarantula and its powers are a legacy passed down from father to son through ritual and sacrifice. Displeased with his cousin's decision to wash his hands of his criminal past, Luis LaMuerto has come to New York to restore honor to the mantle.</p><p>From the Ashes—After discovering that his \"family\" was not as it seemed, the Black Tarantula literally walks out of the fires of hell to extract vengeance upon his murderous cousin. One has to wonder if Daredevil sees the irony in this general situation.</p><p>A Deal with the Devil—Daredevil is typically known for a rigid adherence to the law, sometimes regardless of the consequences or situation. Here, however, faced with the very real threat of a secondary force set to bring chaos to the streets, he’s forced to strike a deal with LaMuerto, despite the fact that he just murdered a man. Desperate times and all that.</p>",

Well, if his name happens to be Tony Stark, it’s a situation that calls for some R &amp; R in the casinos of sin city! Mix in a beautiful archaeologist and the fifty-foot dragon statue she discovered, and a plague of lizards descending on Las Vegas, and it’s a recipe for the sort of armored adventure that’s a perfect chaser after an evening at the movies!</em></p><p>On the banks of the rising Yangtze, a man and woman are walking through some old ruins. The woman is there to observe an archeological find the man is showing her. As they enter a temple, the woman notes two statues of lions, called Shishi, are inside the temple instead of outside. The man suggests the Lions of Fo may have been meant to protect the outside world from the spirits within. He then tells the woman that a price has not yet been set on the object he is about to show her. They arrive in a massive cavern and in it is a massive golden dragon statue.</p><p>On an airplane somewhere over the Mediterranean, a woman is asking Tony Stark why he isn't flying in one of his own planes. When he tells her this is his plane, she says she meant one of his private planes. As he asks what her name is, a man stands up with a bomb strapped to his chest and commands that everyone stay seated. As he moves across the plane, Tony leaves his seat and goes into a bathroom stall. The bomber begins yelling at a woman holding a crying child, and Iron Man appears right behind him. He grabs the bomber and flys right out of the top of the plane. The suicide bomber blows himself up, killing only himself and leaving Iron Man's armor steaming. Iron Man gets back on to the airplane and trys to calm everyone down, but the passengers are angry at what he did and tell him to go back to America.

            "description": "<i>Matthew Sturges, writer of the Eisner-nominated JACK OF FABLES, and his JACK co-writer Bill Willingham, proudly unlock the doors to the HOUSE OF MYSTERY, a new ongoing series that reinvents a classic DC Comics concept. HOUSE OF MYSTERY focuses on five characters trapped in a supernatural bar, trying to solve the mystery of how and why they're imprisoned there. Each one has a terrible past they'd like to forget, and with no books, newspapers or TV allowed in the House, they face an eternity of boredom. But stories become the new currency, and fortunately, the House attracts only the finest storytellers.</i>  <i>In addition to the ongoing trials and struggles of the five unfortunate souls trapped within the HOUSE OF MYSTERY, illustrated by superstar artist Luca Rossi, each issue in the first storyline also includes a short tale, as told by one of the customers, written by Willingham and illustrated by a host of fine guest artists, including two-time Eisner Award nominee Ross Campbell (WATERBABY, Wet Moon), SANDMAN fan favorite and multiple Eisner winner Jill Thompson, and classic horror artist Bernie Wrightson, whose first published work was in House of Mystery #179. This series is topped off with ethereal, jaw-dropping covers from Sam Weber (The New Yorker, The New York Times, Time Magazine)and a stunning variant cover by Wrightson on the debut issue.</i><br /><br />While taking tea with his brother Abel, Cain's House of Mystery disappears from the Dreaming. Years later, Fig Keele is seen running from a mysterious pair of ethereal beings. She escapes into a bar: the ground floor of the House of Mystery, where food and drinks are purchased with stories. <br /><br /><h4>The Hollows</h4> <br />Hungry Sally's story of romance and betrothal, along with a \"difficult\" pregnancy that tore her apart.",

The fought angry fairies, giants, dragons, and army of Rippers (as in \"Jack The...\") and even H.G. Wells War of the Worlds martians...basically, sh— got crazy (go check out Captain Britain and MI 13 scribe Paul Cornell's Marvel Max Wisdom for the whole rundown. You won't be sorry, 'cause it was supremely awesome!).</p><p>And while all that is really handy to know, all you really need to know to begin this series is that one member of Wisdom's team is a known Skrull who's served in MI 13 for years, and usually shape-shifts to look like John Lennon...</p><p>Things are going just as poorly for the heroes on the other side of the pond as the Skrull John Lennon finds himself chained in an MI 13 holding cell. The Joint Intelligence Committee Chair comes down to see why he hasn't been executed, gets yelled at angrily by John about how he killed the other three Skrull Beatles.</p><p>The soldiers guarding John have received conflicting orders about killing the Skrull and when the Joint Chair steps up to pop a cap in his Skrully Beatle ass, Pete Wisdom makes his entrance...</p><p>After offing the bad Skrull and saving the good one, Wisdom informs John that the British forces aren't doing so well as the scene cuts to Captain Britain fighting a Champions-themed Super Skrull.</p><p>Cap lays the hurt down on the Skrull before the armada moves off and he's summoned to a meeting to discuss an operative against the Skrulls.</p><p>Below Captain Britain's sky battle, a young doctor named Faiza Hussain is yammering on and on about how she loves British superheroes (who doesn't, right?!) when a Skrull-piloted robot appears behind her ready to do some zapping. Luckily, she's rescued in a timely manner by none other than...</p><p>Saving accomplished, the Black Knight chats with Faiza. She gets a bit starstruck, he gets a bit flippant (hey, it's how he keeps the Ebony Blade in check!) before heading off to slice more Skrulls. Meanwhile, Captain Britain, Pete Wisdom and the Skrull John Lennon are being addressed by the Prime Minister who explains that all British superheroes now work for MI 13 (kinda like Bond works for MI 6, but these blokes have way more super powers so they work for MI 13). The group is discussing the Skrulls' movements when Captain Britain points out they're heading for the Siege Perilous: the gateway to Otherworld! To Avalon (Yes! That Avalon from Arthurian Legend!)! Where Cap first got his powers! Skrull John points out these extremist Skrulls are all about the wanting and Wisdom points out that what Britain has more of than anything else is magic...which is exactly what the Skrulls are after. The Prime Minister tells the three that they'll head off the Skrulls accompanied by another British hero because if the Skrulls get Avalon's magic, they could rule the world. The other hero, well, we'll let this spread speak for itself with her introduction...</p><p>On the way to intercept the Skrulls, Wisdom and Captain Britain are chatting about chain of command for their group, when Brian reveals his goal for a new direction in life...</p><p>Pete reveals he's been hearing voices about a hero he thinks are about Cap, and Cap's so glad to hear that one of their lot may be receiving visions that he's even more ready to follow Wisdom's lead—as the P.M. put him in charge of the group.</p><p>Back on the war torn streets, Faiza's aiding some inured civilians when a Skrull laser pops out of the ground. Black Knight dispatches quickly, but not quickly enough to save faiza who's been fried.</p><p>Back at the Seige Perilous, the MI 13 heroes arrive to a Skrull welcoming commitee and decide it's time to put a little English on it...</p><p>Skrulls dispatched, the group realizes that the green meanies didn't want to capture the magic, they want to destroy!

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The invasion has started, and no one in the MU is safe, not even the First Family of Comicdom! Aware that some of the Earth's most advanced technology and weaponry is housed in the Baxter Building, the Skrulls have neutralized the building--by transporting it and its inhabitants straight to the Negative Zone! With one member of the Fantastic Four M.I.A. and another \"replaced,\" it's up to the remaining family members--not to mention Franklin and Val—to get back to our dimension, Skrulls or no Skrulls. But are any of our heroes who they think they are?</p><p>In Canada, Sue Richards is on a lecture tour. She calls home to check on how the kids are doing. Johnny says they're fine but Reed's disappeared somewhere with a look of determination. As she arrives in her hotel room, she surprisingly finds Reed waiting for her on her bed. He says he's there to be more romantic. Sue jokingly asks him who he is and what has he done with her husband. Reed then turns into a Skrull and grabs her with what appears to be invisible powers. The Skrull tells here that there is an invisible force-field pressing on her cerebellum. She struggles to ask where Reed is. The Skrull says he's already fallen as will the rest of her family and the world. She struggles against the Skrull and passes out.</p><p>Later at the Baxter Building, it seems that Sue has returned and walks past Johnny and the kids. A Skrull is impersonating Sue and is on a mission. The Skrull heads to Reed's lab in order to send Reed's technology away to the Negative Zone so that it can't be used against them.</p><p>Johnny tries to see what Sue's done while Ben grabs the kids. Johnny enters the lab just as the portal is swallowing everything in front of it. \"Sue\" looks at him as says, \"Forgive me, Johnny.\"</p><p>In the living room, Ben opens the curtains to find they are no longer in Manhattan but appear to be in the Negative Zone. Soon giant bug like creatures begin attack the glass, causing it to crack. Ben grabs the kids again just as they begin breaking through.</p><p>Johnny begins to regain consciousness and Sue is there by his side. Seeing her, he flames on immediately. She asks him to flame down and tells him they are in the middle of a Skrull invasion. She tells him that every team has been infiltrated. Reed sent her to secure the Baxter Building. He asks her why she was so sneaky about it. She tells him that they may have already been compromised and insinuates that Ben is an imposter.</p><p>Meanwhile Ben is in the kitchen and secures the kids in a cabinet. He tells Franklin to watch his sister. Closing the door, he tells them not to come out until he says so. Behind him is a swarm of the alien insects.</p><p>Johnny stands in front of his sister thinking over what she's saying. She asks him to say something. When he says he's thinking, she points out that that isn't his area of expertise. He asks her what her favorite movie is. Sue rolls her eyes but Johnny insists she answer. She answers wrong so Johnny flames on again. He asks her why she brought them there. She points out it was a trap and again mentions his lack of intelligence. Johnny starts thinking about the way she's been talking to him and saying his name. The Skrull reverts and reveals that she is...Lyja, Johnny's ex (that posed as Alicia waaaaay back and married him).</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>You asked for it, X-Fans, and now, you got it! Marvel.com asked you what Chris Claremont’s next project should be. You, the fans, said you wanted to know what today’s new generation of X-Men would be like if the Marvel Universe aged in real-time! Who are the children of the X-Men? And what happened to the original team, Professor X, and Magneto after over 30 years of conflict, victories, and tragedies? Now, at last, the answers arrive as beloved X-Men scribe Chris Claremont reveals an all-new generation of mutant teens!</em></p><p>*<strong><em>SPOILERS*</em></strong></p><p>Now, at last, the answers arrive as beloved X-Men scribe Chris Claremont reveals an all-new generation of mutant teens!</p><p>About a million years ago, Marvel allowed fans to vote on its website for which project they’d like to see Chris Claremont write next. The winner of this poll was GeNext -- a story about who the children of the X-Men would’ve been, had the characters been aging in real time. Claremont’s health problems delayed the launch of the miniseries, but after two years the project has finally come out. Was it worth the wait?</p><p>Well, yes and no. The story itself is, so far, little more than the premise suggests -- a cast of second and third generation X-Men. If that doesn’t excite you, then you might as well put the book down immediately. If you’re the sort of person who read through the whole of “X-Men: The End” and loves “New Exiles”’ reliance on continuity minutiae, you’ll be well at home here. Everyone else, well, you’d better hope the novelty of seeing Colossus’ grandson is enough.</p><p>In fairness, it’s some of Claremont’s better recent work. With a fresh cast to introduce, Claremont actually turns in a cast of fairly engaging kids with immediately distinct personalities. Reading it, you’re transported back to the early days of the (original) “New Mutants”, and I say that in a positive way. There’s a training session, then a scrape in a bar where someone’s forced to use their powers, and there’s some soap opera inter-character drama. It’s a classic, old-school Claremont formula -- the problem is that there’s no suggestion of what the plot’s going to be when I pick up the next issue. We have scenes, but no story.</p><p>Drawing the series is Patrick Scherberger, a name I instantly recognize as being the winner of CBR’s very first Comic Book Idol competition. Nice to see he’s still around. His designs for the kids’ uniforms are really great, looking futuristic yet in a way that’s both fashionable and practical. He draws action in a nice expressive way that echoes a slightly more restrained Humberto Ramos. Some of the backgrounds are a little under-rendered -- only the few pages set in the club have any real detail, where the rest of the issue is pretty samey, but it’s not so jarring it ruins the issue, just a definite area for improvement.</p><p>I can definitely see this turning out to be a fairly entertaining little series, as long as you’re the kind of person the book is aimed at. The quality is such that if the level is maintained, I can see these characters being popular enough to warrant guest-starring in \"New Exiles\" before long, so anyone reading that title might want to take a look. Ultimately, the book’s biggest flaw is its central premise. If the idea of Chris Claremont writing a five issue \"What If: X-Men\" series makes you think it’s worth buying, then this is exactly what you want. If not, it’s unlikely to win you over.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The origin of fan-favorite X-Man Colossus is finally revealed, brought to you by Chris Yost (New X-Men, Messiah Complex) and Trevor Hairsine (X-Men: Deadly Genesis). Deep in the wastes of Siberia, young Piotr Rasputin discovers his mutant abilities -- and becomes the newest target of the ruthless KGB! Guest-starring Professor Xavier.</i></p><h2>Synopsis</h2><p>Our story opens with Piotr talking with his brother Mikhail, as Mikhail prepares to leave for the space program; Piotr doesn’t want him to go, but Mikhail insists that he’s doing it, not just for Russia, but for him to, to make a better world. He says that, whatever happens, he’ll always be watching over him: “Just look to the stars, and know that I am looking back.”</p><p>Three months later, as young Piotr treks home, he sees a military jeep parked in front of his house, and excitedly exclaims that his brother has returned; however, he finds some military officers presenting his crying parents with a medal. Piotr starts crying and runs away. One of the men sees him running and follows (the man is later identified as Alexander Vazhin, a friend of Mikhail’s, so we’ll go with that from the start).</p><p>Piotr runs into the snowy field, and then kneels, yelling that his brother was supposed to come back; he smashes the Earth with his fists, which have just turned metal, resulting in a huge impact that kicks up snow, earth, and stone, and shreds his clothes. Piotr weakly stares at his metal skin, and then passes out in the middle of the little green clearing he’s created. Alexander sees him.</p><p>Back at home, Ma and Pa Rasputin try to convince Piotr that his brother had a gift, and had to leave. Piotr gets angry, and transforms again.</p><p>In Moscow, at the headquarters of the Federal Security Service, Alexander (who works there, it seems) talks with his superiors and basically lies through his teeth about what happened with Piotr. However, his superiors aren’t buying it, and, after he leaves, they order surveillance on both Piotr and Alexander.</p><p>Alexander visits the F.S.S. archives, and pulls up a New York Times headline from May 5th, [year conveniently obscured], “Mutant Attack at Cape Citadel?” with a photo that’s a partial from X-Men #1’s cover.</p><p>One year later, Piotr holds his newborn baby sister Illyana in his arms and promises that he will watch over her, no matter what.</p><p>“Time passes”; little Illyana runs up to her brother at the farm and insists that he paint another picture of her (conceited little bitch); Mr. Dubenko, an FSS agent posing as a farmhand, watches all this from afar, and complains that he’s been hanging out on a Siberian farm for four years with nothing happening.</p><p>In Moscow, Alexander is at a bar, and answers a cell-phone call; the voice says they need to have a private conversation, and that Alex shouldn’t be alarmed. Alex looks around and finds himself sitting on a bar stool in an otherwise completely white space; Professor X wheels up, and says he believes Alex has been trying to contact him. Professor X explains that they’re on the astral plane; Alex says that Mikhail was his best friend, and they promised to look after each others’ families if anything happened to them. He knows what Piotr is, and believes that if the Russian government finds out their first inclination will be to make him into a weapon, when he’s really an artist and poet. Professor X says he’ll be in touch, and “by the way, they’ve thrown your body outside. The barkeep assumes you’ve passed out.” Alex wakes up lying in an alley against a dumpster.</p><p>Two years later, Dubenko is still pretending to be a farmhand, but catches a glimpse of Piotr transforming and lifting a tractor to please Illyana (“Piotr! Shiny! Come on!!”). He radios the FSS; Alex sees the transmission, and picks up his phone to call Xavier; suddenly, Professor X cuts in psychically and tells him not to be alarmed when three FSS agents appear and arrest him for treason, which they do.</p><p>At the farm, a bunch of commandos arrive to abduct Piotr; long (well-drawn) fight scene, he wins, including, impressively, leaping into the air and punching a helicopter to the ground. He finds one of the commandos is Dubenko, and Dubenko tells him that the Russians will never leave him or his family alone. Suddenly, Alex appears and shoots Dubenko with a tranq. Alex says that, as of tonight, the Russian government no longer has any interest in the Rasputin family, as, thanks the ‘patronage’ of an unseen “guardian angel”, no one will remember what happened tonight and Alex has been promoted to Director of Intelligence.</p><p>“Time passes”, and we get a redo of the Giant-Sized X-Men #1 scene where Piotr saves Illyana from a tractor. He looks up and sees Professor X and Alex standing nearby; Alex introduces the Prof, who explains that he needs Piotr to join his X-Men. Alex angrily says that the point of all this was to prevent Piotr from becoming a weapon; Professor X says that Piotr already is a weapon, “but I need him to become a hero”. Prof says that dark times are coming, and while the Russians won’t be coming for Colossus for the time being, others will, as mutants are power and will always be pursued; further, that Illyana may also be a mutant, and Prof wants Piotr to help him create a world “where she need not live in fear.”</p><p>Piotr has a chat with his dad, and Pa says that Mikhail knew the answer to the question, and so does Piotr: they belong to the world, and must do what they have to. Piotr, in metal form, looks in on his sleeping sister, and vows that he does this to make a better world for her, and that he will always be watching.</p><p>We cut to Westchester, where Professor X and Colossus (now in his familiar uniform; “In all my life I’ve never seen such clothing as this.”) enter the study, where Wolverine, Storm, Thunderbird, Banshee, Nightcrawler, and Sunfire are waiting “Welcome, Colossus...to the X-Men.”)</p>",

Based on the true stories of the men who served their country so valiantly in World War 2, Dynamite's all-new comic book series is being developed with game writers David Wohl and Mike Neumann, along with artist Davide (Star Wars) Fabbri!</p><p>Issue #1 will be 40 big pages (with 32 pages of story and art) of non-stop action as we pick up with our squad in the events leading up to D-Day! Our story centers around Sergeant Matthew Baker and the role that he plays in \"Operation: Overlord,\" a.k.a. D-Day. Originally assigned to lead his squad on a mission to recapture the French village of Carentan, Baker's plans unexpectedly change when his C-47 transport plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire and he's forced to jump prematurely, along with the rest of his men, who are now scattered across the landing zone. Now Baker must battle fatigue, the elements, and the overwhelming German army, to find his compatriots and continue on his mission to defeat the enemy and help win the war. Featuring two covers, one from interior artist Davide Fabbri and the other from Stjepan Sejic!</p><p>40pgs</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>With bloodsports banned in the UK, a group of overfed Brit Aristos have relocated to the Louisiana forests. Their aim? To pit themselves (aided only by a vast pack of slavering hounds and their own copious wealth) against a truly worthy foe: a single, terrified fox. Sadly for them, there’s more than one furry little critter in the woods tonight…Writer Simon Spurrier (GUTSVILLE, SILVER SURFER: IN THY NAME) and superstar artist Ben Oliver (ULTIMATE X-MEN, GHOST RIDER ANNUAL) present a brandy-swigging one-shot huntfest: 1-part ethical dilemma, 2-parts nationalistic cliché, 659 parts insane slice’n’dice-o-rama. Snikt! Also, includes a special back-up story written by Fear Agents' Rick Remender and Jerome Opena!</em></p><h4>Story 1</h4><ul><li><p>Louisiana, the woods: Hunting dogs and a hunter on a vehicle are in search for their prey. Wolverine hides in the shadows, claws drawn. A flashback to two days earlier, New Orleans: Logan gets into a bar fight. A young man offers him a ride and takes Logan to a camp out of town. Logan isn't happy to stay in this hippie commune, but he accepts their welcome. They want him to aid in fighting English hunters, enjoying the sport of killing innocent foxes. Logan refuses.</p></li><li><p>Present: Wolverine is tracked by the dogs, but foils them and shows he's smarter. The night before: Logan is sick of the hippies talking about the hunters. Their leader says he'll change his mind in the next morning. The aristocrats prepare for the game as the hippies play nice and offer them food. One of the hunters use Logan to get on his horse and another insults his nationality. He's ready to help the hippies.</p></li><li><p>Present: The dogs find Wolverine and it's a brutal fight. He manages to escape their grip. The hunter finds him too, but his shots are missed. Eight hours earlier: Wolverine explains he's not against hunting for a reason – survival and food for example – but the aristocrats have no good excuse for killing the foxes. He ambushes the hunters and ruins their game. One of them sees Logan and is fascinated.</p></li><li><p>Present: Wolverine attacks his hunter, but the latter shoots poison darts at him – and hits a soft spot. Seven hours earlier: The plan goes on and Logan wears a fox disguise, scaring the aristocrats. It's enough to make them leave Louisiana. The hippies celebrate and the guy who brought Logan in gives him a \"Moonshine drink\". Logan leaves the place and go to find drinks.</p></li><li><p>Present: Wolverine is dizzy due to the sedative the hunter shot at him. He finds himself back in the hippie camp. Two hours earlier: Logan sits in a diner and drinks. One of the aristocrats introduces himself and says that he was looking for a real hunt, a man who is really ready for a fight. He confesses that he did a research on Wolverine and planned everything, starting from the brawl in the bar and the hippie offering him a ride. The same hippie who gave marked him with the \"Moonshine.\"</p></li><li><p>Present: Wolverine pukes on the hippie who works for his hunter. The hunting dogs are in the camp too and they found the marked prey – the hippie. Ninety minutes ago: The aristocrat still tries to convince Logan to participate in the game, revealing his high-tech suit and hounds. When all fails, he threatens Logan with a tranquilizer gun.</p></li><li><p>Now: The dogs feast on the hippie as Wolverine sits on a tree and throws on them a Molotov bomb, burning the hounds. One hour ago: Logan is eventually convinced and agrees to play. He covers himself in the blood and smell of dead foxes left in the woods by the hunters, ready to play as the prey. Now: The hunter gets to the camp and finds his dead dogs. Wolverine jumps on him from above with drawn claws, ready for a fair fight.</p></li></ul><h4>Story 2</h4><ul><li><p>Bangkok, Thailand: Logan sits in the garden of a monastery, thinking about his dear ones who died because of the bad people he dealt with. He acknowledges his wrong side, the one that gets people killed. Now he tries to find a way to keep it caged.</p></li><li><p>A monk named Klahan thanks Logan for cleaning the place from drugs and prostitution, all without violence. Logan says that only violence will truly scare the criminals, but the monk accepts that no good can exist without evil.</p></li><li><p>A young woman runs after Logan and thanks him for what he did, but he gives credit to the monks. There is an immediate click between the two and the lady offers Logan a dinner at her place.</p></li><li><p>The woman, Dao, tells Logan that she was brought from Thailand and told she would work as a dancer, but made her a prostitute. She says no man would like to be with her after that, but Logan is not such a man. They kiss and go to bed, but Logan stops and says he can't do this because he is trying to become a better man. He leaves Dao's apartment.</p></li><li><p>Logan gets to the monastery as it rains. He senses that something bad happened: The criminals came back and massacred the monks. Klahan is the last one remained, barely alive and tortured by the villains. Logan is now ready to take care of them his way: Slashing and breaking bones. The last one was supposed to remain alive and take Logan to his boss, but his tattoo was enough to give him what he needed. Klahan dies in Logan's harms, disappointed that Logan gave in to his inner beast.</p></li><li><p>Dao is in her apartment, getting the news that her men were killed. Wolverine breaks into her house, representing Logan's dark side. He kills the crime boss and leaves the place with no remorse.</p></li></ul>",

But as a Fillian warlord, an Imperial princess, and a mysterious Earthman spread chaos through the wastelands, will Skaar save the puny survivors -- or smash them? Another epic fever dream from Greg Pak, writer of \"Planet Hulk\" and World War Hulk\" -- featuring the return of legendary Hulk artist Ron Garney!</i></p><p>Hulk was unaware he left behind his newly born son, believing him dead like the rest of his people leaves Sakaar and heads towards Earth for vengenge for the atrocities committed against him. But the child is truly the son of hulk. Though Skaar was just hours born when he was lost to the fighting he was able to stand and fight. For a month he roamed the planet facing and besting any beast that crossed his path. When, suddenly, a group of women and children fleeing the Barbarians seeking to kill the newborn and children are attacked by the insects. Skaar helps the children but ultimitly can save none of them.</p><p>Time passes and Skaar is now traveling with a group of the now nomatic tribe. He is called their ssavior the surviving son of their once fierce queen. But peace does not last, especially on Sakaar. The barbarians, led by the Axeman find the tribe and with their beasts terrible flames make quick work of Skaar. The remanding survivers are brought to camp for the celebration of his death as livestock. As the barbarians prepair their boiling pots for the slaves Skaar reamerges. Killing the guards and standing toe to toe with the Axeman.</p>",

I don't know. Marv gave himself up to the Skrulls and said he wanted to rejoin the Invasion. Then, next second, he is after the Thunderbolts. The only thing that links this is when Marv was watching the Thunderbolts on TV and saying they are an abomination.</li><li>Agent Brand floats in space, and recounts her first time on S.W.O.R.D. and dealing with Skrulls. Then she bumps into a Skrull batle ship and she looks like she can get into a vent. Pretty Meh</li><li>Wonder Man now is trapped with Beast from the Shuttle, and they discuss their past friendship and mistrust because of their situation. Then they separate. Pretty Muh.</li><li>Noh-Varr in The Cube has the Warden doped up on nanobots in Noh-Varr 's spittle, so Warden can report to Maria Hill. All the prisoners are getting a docile making wavelength from a program rescued from MB's ship computer until the Skrull virus breaks the wave transmission and it all goes to hell. A Skrull is the cause and MB destroys him while MB goes about forming his army. Interesting development.</li><li>The Agents of Atlas story is the most stunning. The Skrulls captured Namora and dehydrate her like Namor, but Gorilla Man and M-11 rescue her, take the Skrull General captive, and Marvel Boy, Bob Grayson, dissects him, and beheads him, in preparation for the counter attack of the humans. The General is commenting the whole time and eventually realizes these Agents are doing the self same thing the Skrulls were doing. I could just shout. But this is the only story not cross-referenced to another issue in Secret Invasion.</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p>(Tarnax VII, many months ago) <br/> In the far reaches of the Skrull Empire, plans are afoot. Chrell and Fremin are chatting. Fremin doesn't understand what they are doing there. Would the Empire really give these warlords the next Super-Skrull to resolve a border dispute? He is soft. Chrell replies that the child shows promise, and can be hardened. He asks him to come along as their guest has arrived. Fremin is surprised to find that the guest is Queen Veranke. She informs Commander Chrell that she has need of him. Fremin is surprised. He thinks this is insane. He cannot listen to her. He cannot <em>trust</em> her. Chrell, without a word, takes out his weapon and shoots Fremin dead. He informs Veranke that Fremin was a close friend and an excellent instructor, but he was not a believer. Queen Veranke then entrusts Chrell with two tasks for the glory ahead. She needs an army trained, and when the day comes, she needs the Prince eliminated. He is too dangerous to live. Chrell replies that when the day comes, he will end his blasphemous life himself.<br/><br/> </p><p>(Earth, present) <br/> It is a bright day and the runaways are in New York City, with Molly showing Klara the sites, such as the Empire State Building, the Baxter Building and a rooftop where they once beat up a guy. Times Square is only four blocks away. Xavin finds this unacceptable. Nico explains that it's called hiding in plain sight. It's only for a few hours so that Klara can say goodbye to her home. Then they will return to Los Angeles and drop off the radar. Chase stops at a hot dog vendor and Karolina is appalled. They brought Klara from the past to save her, not <em>poison</em> her. Chase asks what <em>she's</em> going to feed her. Tofurkey? That freaks him out and he's <em>from</em> this century. Klara talks to Molly. She feels that the clothes people wear seem awfully... sinful. Should Nico not cover her shoulders?</p> <p>Xavin is still complaining. She says that in the Skrull language, hiding in plain sight also means 'begging to get caught.' They shouldn't even have to be running. They shouldn't have to hide. \"Here it comes,\" sighs Victor. Xavin adds that New York City is where they <em>should</em> be. Is this city not home to Earth's superhumans? And yet, they are fugitives. They are treated like criminals when they should be the <em>rulers</em> of this world. Everyone, including Karolina, stops and looks at Xavin. She blushes and nervously admits that it sounded bad. What she meant was, they should be more like leaders, like the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. Karolina places a hand on her shoulder and figures she should quit while she's ahead. \"Or maybe stop thinking in general,\" adds Victor.</p> <p>Klara is looking skywards, and Molly reminds her that Chase said she shouldn't do that. She looks like a hick tourist. Klara keeps her eyes aimed high, replying that she is sorry, but she doesn't think she will ever become accustomed to the wonders of their world. Molly says sure she will. She wouldn't believe the things she has gotten used to, like vampires and giants. As she speaks, a shadow crosses them and Molly turns to look up. \"Whoa!\" she exclaims as she sees a Skrull invasion force approaching.</p> <p>Numerous Skrulls along with their equipment descend from the skies. \"It's raining Xavins,\" jokes Molly, not realizing the seriousness of the situation. \"Um, sweetie,\" says Karolina, as Xavin tries to figure out what's going on. The Skrulls land and Nico tells Xavin to snap out of it. What is this? she asks. Xavin's eyes glow and she turns to them before creating a flat forcefield which hurls them all away from danger, but which also knocks them out.</p> <p>(several blocks away) <br/> In Times Square, the Young Avengers swing bravely into action. The Vision, Speed, Wiccan, Hawkeye, Patriot and Hulkling charge towards Times Square with Eli calling the shots. He orders them to spread out and protect the civilians. Tommy reckons they're a little outgunned, but Eli says they will hold the invaders until help arrives. A Skrull picks up a New York Transit bus and Speed turns to the Vision. He thought the Skrulls couldn't do powers. He thought it was only the Super-Skrull guy and he only had the FF's bag of tricks. The Vision replies that it would appear they were wrong. Billy asks Teddy if this is about him. Have the Skrulls come back for him? Teddy has no idea. He doesn't know <em>what</em> to do. Watching from afar, a Skrull spots Hulkling and thinks it's a potential match. \"Inform the commander.\"</p> <p>(meanwhile) <br/> The runaways are slowly recovering from the concussive effects of Xavin's forcefield. Nico and Victor come round first and they see two Skrulls talking to Xavin. Unfortunately, they are speaking Skrullian so they have no idea what is being said. Victor needs a little more time to fully reboot. The others are still unconscious. He asks Nico if she has any ideas. Nico reckons she's already done a teleportation spell, but she's still got a spell that will stop Xavin's heart - assuming she's got one. She asks him to wait for her signal.</p> <p>Xavin shouts at the two new arrivals, and they decide to leave for the time being. Xavin then turns and sees her friends sprawled across the ground. She checks on Karolina who emits a groan, and uses her Invisible Woman powers to place each of her friends inside small capsules with which she can move them. Xavin looks extremely unhappy at what's going on. She takes the runaways over the stranded cars and away from danger, but, not realizing this, Nico casts a spell. \"Pop,\" she utters, and the capsules explode, dropping each of the runaways to the ground. As soon as Nico lands, she tells Victor to hit Xavin with everything he's got. He asks about the others, but Nico tells him that if they don't take Xavin down now, it won't matter. Xavin sees the kids fall and creates invisible cushions to protect them, but Victor takes the opportunity to use wreckage around them to wrap Xavin up in slithers of metal.</p> <p>Xavin insists that she was taking them to the Leapfrog. She's trying to <strong>save</strong> them. Nico asks what makes her believe her less. She attacking them, or her extended family playing 'space invaders' in Times Square. She asks Victor to squeeze, and the metal tightens around Xavin's Skrull body. She tells them that they have to trust her, but Victor replies that the team isn't big on trust. All she is, is another Skrull, just like the invaders. Xavin assures him that he's wrong. She isn't like them. The Skrull Empire has attempted invasions of Earth before. Her own parents did so, but this is different. These Skrulls are religious extremists. They believe in a prophecy that Earth belongs to them, and that their god has promised it to them. They think it is their by right. They will kill everyone that stands in their way... human or Skrull, she continues. They should forget everything she has said about standing up and fighting, and about her calling them cowards. They must get away. They have to <em>run</em>.</p> <p>Xavin adds that because these Skrulls see every human as a sin against their god, and they won't hesitate to kill them all, even the children like Molly and Klara. Nico turns and looks at her still-unconscious friends. \"This invasion...\" she begins. Xavin cuts her off. She informs Nico that if it has come to this, then the invasion is over. They have <em>won</em>. Now it's just a matter of cleaning up. She begs Nico, and asks her to remember her battle cry. Nico says, \"Try not to die,\" and quickly wises up. She asks Victor to grab everyone and get them outta there. She knows that Karolina will hate her for this, but Xavin tells her that at least she will be alive.</p> <p>(elsewhere) <br/> Hulkling thinks that, because he is half-Skrull, he can talk to them. He rushes over to a group of Skrulls and introduces himself to his 'brothers of the Empire' as Hulkling, the son of Princess Anelle. He tells them that they have to stop this. They all turn on him and blast him from all directions. Teddy screams in pain as he takes everything they've got. Nearby, Hawkeye think that this is insane. Where are the <em>Avengers</em>?</p> <p>From afar, Chrell is watching footage on a large screen with X'iv, and he pauses the image to ask for a genetic match on Hulkling. The computer is unable to identify Teddy due to the subject's form being in flux. This is due to the energy attack from the other Skrulls. Chrell tells it to extrapolate, and the computer states that there is a 57% match probability. Chrell is convinced that it is Dorrek and feels that it's fortunate that they attacked so quickly that they didn't recognize him. He can't believe that the prophesised savior of the Skrull Empire is living amongst them, and an <em>Avenger</em> no less. Chrell thinks that if news of his presence spread through their armada, it could instil confusion, and then doubt. Doubt is the enemy of faith. X'iV informs him that more heroes are coming. On Earth, the Initiative charge into action led by Gauntlet. Chrell doesn't think it matters. Their victory is promised to them.</p> <p>(New York City) <br/> The runaways have retreated to the Leapfrog which is cloaked atop a tall building. Nico looks after Karolina who is still unconscious. She hopes Karolina won't hate her for this. The Leapfrog's systems come online and he warns Nico and Victor that he has detected multiple spacecraft. Vic already knows, and he takes the 'Frog high into the air. Vic is feeling torn. He doesn't think this is right, but Nico asks him to trust her. It's her decision, and it might have been wrong, but their luck is only going to last so long, and this is too big. Vic replies that Xavin was going to help. He should have stayed with her. As Nico assures him that she needs him there, two extremely large Skrulls appear right in front of the Leapfrog; both ready to attack.</p> <p>On the ground, the heroes are struggling. Stature is battered to the ground, and Speed is concerned for Wiccan who can't seem to pull it together. Billy wants to find Teddy, but Speed tries to get through to him that they're going to <em>die</em> there.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Xavin has wriggled free of her shackles and flamed on. She lands on a building overlooking the action in semi-invisible mode. Xavin then looks over and sees a couple of Skrull ships coming in to land. This is band news, she feels. They're all going to die. She has to help. She then notices what the commotion is about. \"Oh no, no please... not him,\" she gasps. Two Skrulls step out onto the street. One of them is Chrell. He tells the other that he knows his orders. If their target talks, he will lie. He is a deceiver and a betrayer. He should treat him like the Kree he is. Xavin looks at the forlorn figure lying before them. \"Dorrek.\"</p> <p>Xavin acts quickly. He rockets in and causes an explosion between Teddy and the Skrulls. By the time the smoke dissipates, Chrell sees a hole in the ground and no sign of Dorrek. Xavin has taken him into the sewers beneath New York. As she drags him along as quickly as she can, she tries to wake him up. He finally wakes up, though he is still groggy. \"Billy... have to stop them...\" he whispers. Xavin agrees, but first he has to survive. That will actually require being conscious. \"They're coming, do you hear me?\" she warns. Xavin turns to see the tunnel behind them light up in flame. They are soon bundled over by a blast and sent sprawling into the water. Dorrek falls unconscious again, and by the time Xavin regains her facilities, she finds three Skrulls standing over them. Their leader says, \"Die sinners.\"</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Acclaimed writer Alan Moore once again joins forces with artist Kevin O'Neill for THE BLACK DOSSIER — a stunning original hardcover graphic novel that is the next chapter in the fantastic saga of THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN! England in the mid-1950s is not the same as it was. The powers that be have instituted some changes. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen have been disbanded and disavowed, and the country is under the control of an iron-fisted regime. Now, after many years, the still youthful Mina Murray and a rejuvenated Allan Quatermain return in search of some answers — answers that can only be found in a book buried deep in the vaults of their old headquarters — a book that holds the key to the hidden history of the League throughout the ages: The Black Dossier. As Allan and Mina delve into the details of their precursors, some dating back centuries, they must elude their dangerous pursuers who are hellbent on retrieving the lost manuscript…and ending the League once and for all. THE BLACK DOSSIER is an elaborately designed, cutting-edge volume that includes a \"Tijuana Bible\" insert and a 3-D section complete with custom glasses, as well as additional text pieces, maps, and a stunning cutaway double-page spread of Captain Nemo's Nautilus submarine by Kevin O'Neill. Don't miss what's sure to be one of the most talked-about books of the year!</i></p>",

But it’s a destiny Philip Voight must prevent at any cost. The first newuniversal one-shot expands the mythos of this world, thanks to writer KIERON GILLEN (Phonogram), hand-picked by newuniversal’s Warren Ellis, and the brilliant art of GREG SCOTT shows us the world, like it never was…in 1959.</i></p>",

The only question is, will she survive it? <br /><br />Issue description:<br /><br />Layla has been waiting for the right moment to escape, and it happens when a piece of space debris falls from the sky over some guards. In Manhattan, she sees a mutant girl called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57054\" href=\"/linqon/4005-57054/\"> Linqon </a>escaping from the police using her energy powers. She witness an mutant rights protest and makes two boys join the protest. With the help of a guy named Dwayne, she makes her way to Atlantic City . There she meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57040\" href=\"/ruby-summers/4005-57040/\"> Ruby Summers</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\"> Cyclops</a>'s daughter, who possess a black optic blast and an organic ruby form. She leads Layla to Cyclops, who now is an old man with cyborg parts. Cyclops attacks Layla and accuses her of being a monster for not using her knowledge to help mutant-kind. She tells him that she was aware of the bad things that happened to them and even to her, but she had to do them anyways. Cyclops forgives her and gives her new clothes. Layla then talks to Ruby and convinces her to follow the path of the X-Men and free mutant-kind. Ruby agrees and goes to New York, where she, Dwayne and Linqon rebel against the human oppressors with the help of other pro-mutant humans. This event went on to be known as the \"<a data-ref-id=\"4060-57538\" href=\"/summers-rebellion/4060-57538/\"> Summers Rebellion</a>\". <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />  ****Spoilers!!****<br /> <br /><strong>Full Summary <br /></strong>.</p>80 years in the future, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1447\" href=\"/layla-miller/4005-1447/\"> Layla </a>is in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56868\" href=\"/mutant-containment-center-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/4020-56868/\"> internment camp</a> located in Sheepshead Bay that she and the dupe of Madrox were in, in the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-48995\" href=\"/messiah-complex/4045-48995/\"> Messiah Complex </a>arc. She is standing in the middle of a large X she had drawn in the dirt, facing one of the walls. She’s been in the same position for eight days, and the guards have dubbed her “The Statue”. They have a bet running on how long she’s going to stay that way. One guard is determined not to lose the hundred dollars riding on it and goes to make her go inside. She goes on about space junk and the guards ask what her point is. “We’re due,” she tells him, just before he is struck by a large metal, circular object. As she climbs over the junk to escape, she points out the irony that the program that used to monitor space junk was shut down to fund the camps.<br /> <br />In Atlantic City, an old man is sitting on a bench at the beach. A bright red hand is placed on his shoulder, asking her father to go inside. He replies that he knows “she” is coming today. She reminds him that he has been saying that every day for the past twenty years. He agrees, but looks a photo, regardless. It’s a young girl, with blonde hair covering her right eye.<br /> <br />Layla is walking through downtown Manhattan. She stops in front of a wig shot, looking in the window. A homeless man is sitting in front of the shop, and he asks what the ‘M’ is for. 'Miller' she tells him. She then breaks the glass window and takes a blonde wig. The man freaks out, asking if she’s nuts, now the police will come. She replies that that is what she’s counting on and so is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57054\" href=\"/linqon/4005-57054/\"> Linqon</a>. Just then, a blue haired girl is running down the street, being chased by two police cursers demanding her surrender. Someone walking behind Layla throws a lit cigarette on the ground, and Linqon runs up to Layla. Layla assures her that everything will be fine, just as the cars that were pursuing Linqon crash into one that was arriving because of Layla breaking into the store. Gasoline leaks from the cars onto the cigarette on the ground and the cars ignite. Linqon takes advantage of it and takes off.<br /> <br /><a data-ref-id=\"4005-71344\" href=\"/dwayne/4005-71344/\"> Dwayne</a>, a blonde car thief, sees this and becomes interested in how Layla was able to do it. He follows her to a mutant rights protest and watches as she approaches two guys who are talking about how the camps don’t affect them. She engages them in conversation and convinces them that the government is about to implement a program that will hold anyone with mutants in their bloodline going back ten generations in captivity for observation indefinitely. This changes their minds and they join in the protest. Dwayne steps out of the shadows, she Layla tells him she knows his name and that he’s a car thief. Even more impressed, he agrees to give her a ride from Manhattan to Atlantic City. When he asks her what’s in Atlantic City, her response is just as enigmatic; “Once I’m there? Me.” However, he does just that.<br /> <br />When they arrive in Atlantic City, Dwayne is trying to convince Layla that there is absolutely nothing there and hasn’t been for ten years. She asks him if she really believes that, then why did he drive here there? He says he didn’t know he had a choice. She reminds him that everyone has choices, then corrects herself and admits, except her. He asks her what she means, and she tells him that because she knows what everyone’s going to do, she doesn’t have the right to make her own decisions. Dwayne tells Layla he has no idea what she’s talking about, then admits that he drove her because he really had nothing better to do. His explanation is cut short, however, as they are attacked by a blast of energy that hits the ground directly in front of Dwayne. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57040\" href=\"/ruby-summers/4005-57040/\"> woman </a>from before appears and tells them to get lost, then freezes. “Wait... you?”<br />“I get that a lot.” is her response. “You’re his daughter.” The woman tells Layla that ‘he’ is waiting for her. Layla goes off and Ruby helps Dwayne stand. He introduces himself and she tells him her name. He asks if it’s just a coincidence, and Ruby says it was Layla who told her parents to name her that.<br /> <br />When Layla sees <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\"> Cyclops</a>, she runs towards him, elated to see a truly familiar presence, only to be slapped away. He proceeds to call her a monster and blame her for everything that has happened to him. When he demands that she look at what has become of him, both his left arm and leg are robotic as well as a metal plate over his left eye. This finally gives her a chance to respond and she breaks down in tears. She reminds him that she did know what was going to happen, and that includes knowing what was going to happen to her. She did everything knowing what was going to happen. She used to have terrible nightmares about what they would do to her in the camp, but she did it anyways because she knew it had to happen. “You think if I had the power to make things not happen, I wouldn’t have used it to save myself? <strong><em>You think I wanted this?</em></strong>” She pounds on his chest, calling him names and begging him to kill her if that’s what he wants. She doesn’t care how, but she wants him to kill her because she’s just so tired of knowing. Scott realises how wrong he was about her and he kneels down and holds her as she sobs promising her that everything will be okay.<br /> <br />Later, Ruby marvelling at the situation of taking the picture of Layla that her father has been caring for decades. After it’s done, Scott asks Layla if she knows how she’s going to get back. She says no, and he’s surprised. He offers to tell her, but she says no. It’s safer to assume that if she doesn’t know something, it’s for a reason. Scott then tells her that he’s got clothing set aside for her.<br /> <br />After changing, they’re in a ruined casino and Layla’s asking Ruby how long they’ve been hiding in Atlantic City. Ruby informs her they’ve been there for years. Cyclops is mostly using power cells for energy and as long as Ruby stays in her ruby form, she doesn’t require food. When Layla inquires about what would happen if she switched to her human form, the Summers woman admits that she doesn’t know. She’s been in that form for so many years that if she were to go back, she may age almost seventy years is seconds. In need for a change of subject, Layla brings up Linqon. She tells Ruby she’s a new mutant in New York, helpless and afraid. Ruby doesn’t understand the point. “She needs your help. Because things are about to change. It’s your time.” Ruby walks away from her, but Layla follows her, insistent. She reminds the older woman about her father’s dream, and Ruby admits that yes, she heard the story, but she also heard about all the mutants who died because of it, the ’norms’ who rejoiced in their deaths and that the ones who didn’t die ended up in camps. Layla reminds her that she experienced it firsthand, but normal people are starting to come around and that by helping Linqon, it will start the revolution. Ruby begins to challenge that, but Cyclops interrupts, Dwayne beside him, and says that they have nothing to lose because they aren’t really living as it is. Ruby smiles and says she did know that, but she wasn’t sure he did. “Layla... to hell with getting the apple cart rolling. Let’s kick the damn thing over.”<br /> <br />In the city, the President is giving a speech over television screens in the street. He is saying that they don’t know how the plans for ‘Operation Purity’ became public before they were ready to implement it, but because it has, they are not going to deny it. The people must trust in their elected leaders to make the tough decisions, testing centers are being set up and all citizens will be required to submit for genetic testing. “And for those who believe that they are exempt from the law... Incentive will be provided.” As he gives the threat, Sentinels rise on either side of the main screen. A man with a megaphone is yelling that their country has gone insane. The President is still going on about how the testing is being done out of love. “War is peace. Hatred is acceptance.” Ruby can’t take anymore of the speech. She shoots one Sentinel through the head before yelling “And <strong><em>up</em></strong> is down! And <strong><em>down </em></strong>is where <strong><em>you</em></strong> are going!” Linqon looks up from the crowd to see Ruby and Dwayne on a rooftop. She introduces herself. She says she is a mutant and she knows most of them are not. But it’s time they stand together and say that it’s enough. It is time to rebel.<br /> <br />As the battle rages, civilians and Ruby’s team against Sentinels and the police force, Layla walks right through the thick of it writing in her diary. The stuff that is happening around her will be known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57538\" href=\"/summers-rebellion/4060-57538/\"> Summers’ Rebellion</a>. What will happen next, she’s still not really sure of and that’s unsettling. It makes her too much like everybody else and she doesn’t want to be like everyone else. Right now she’s having a good time being Layla Miller and knowing stuff.  <p><br /></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>To save the woman he loves, the greatest hero of all time becomes the pawn of ultra-dimensional forces when a wounded emissary from a world of doomed super gods comes to Earth on the eve of the Final Crisis. His mission: recruit Superman's help against an epic, reality-spanning menace that originated in the Crisis on Infinite Earths!</em></p><p>The issue starts with Superman being blasted by what looks to be a Monitor, who is chipping away at Superman’s \"cosmic armor\". We follow Superman back in time to see Clark Kent sitting next to Lois Lane's hospital bed saying that he'll do anything to save her. The Monitor Zillo Valla shows up and stops time, saying that if Superman helps her, she will save Lois' life. Superman follows her to her ship, where it is being attacked by another ship. Superman realizes that Zillo Valla has recruited Supermen of other universes to help in her mission: Ultraman from the Anti-Matter Earth, Captain Marvel of Earth-5, Overman of Earth-10, and Captain Allen Adam, the \"Quantum Superman\" (and a Doctor Manhattan look-alike), of Earth-4. The enemy ship takes damage from Ultraman and crash lands on Earth-51, part of the \"graveyard universe\", named that after the fight between Superman-Prime and Monarch destroyed most of the universe. The Monitor's ship then lands in Limbo, where the Supermen are greeted by Merryman. Superman and Captain Marvel make their way to the Library of Limbo to see the one book that Merryman tells them is there.</p><p>When they get to the Library, they see that the book is a book with an infinite number of pages, all occupying the same space. Superman and Captain Marvel realize that if they can get the book to the ship, the ship will be able to process all of the infinite number of stories and would figure a way to fix itself. When they try to pick up the book, it starts to tell them a story about the Monitors.</p><p>The story says that there was one Monitor who was as large as the void itself, but a flaw was found in it. To contain this flaw, the Monitor creates the Multiverse to contain it, but it didn’t foresee the birth of complex life within the Multiverse. So the Monitor sends out a probe, possibly the original Monitor from <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>, to investigate the abnormality within the flaw. It witnesses the events of the original Crisis and encounters the concept of \"stories\" and feels threatened by the existence of \"stories\", realizing that it has no defense against it. The Monitor seals the flaw, and all that seems to remain is a statue of Superman, dubbed \"a vast, uncanny form\". After eons of the form standing idle, the race of Monitors develops around it. They determine, after a few eons, that the form must be some sort of weapon that will help them against some ultimate enemy. Meanwhile, as blood falls from the sky, presumably from the Bleed, the Eater of Life, called Mandrakk, senses his freedom.</p><p>There is suddenly a burst of lightning as Superman and Marvel are blasted back from the book and Marvel is transformed back into Billy Baston, who can't remember who he is or his magic word. Superman makes his way back to the ship, telling Captain Adam that he’ll need his help to get the book. Demanding answers, Superman rips off Zillo Valla's door, only to see her sucking out the blood, vampire-style, of Overman. It turns out that she needs to drain \"life\" from Overman in order to power her ship. Valla tells Superman that the destroyer from earlier is considered Mandrakk's nanotechnology and the he has found them. Captain Adam tells Superman to come outside; the sky has just shattered. The sky has turned red, Ultraman is holding the infinite book and saying that evil wins, and a ship bearing, what looks like, Brainiac’s symbol appears in the sky.</p>",

            "description": "<p>(somewhere in the Milky Way, two days ago)</p><p>A Majesdanian space ship flies through space with four Majesdanians on board; deHalle, vaDanti, vaRikk and the General. They are survivors of Majesdane's destruction, and they blame Karolina Dean for that disaster. The Majesdanians pick up Karolina's signal on Earth, and they decide to travel there. The fiesty deHalle marks her revenge.</p><p>(Earth, present, on the outskirts of Los Angeles)</p><p>The runaways return to the City of Angels after their run-in with the Kingpin, the Punisher and some Skrulls in New York City. Chase listens to his his favorite DJ, Val Rhymin on KZIT. Victor and Xavin aren't sure of where to go, but Nico suggests they ask the Leapfrog where to go - the Leapfrog, being the Pride's ships, would know all their locations. The Leapfrog informs them that there is a place in Malibu that is unbreached, but the alarms are still active. Xavin, curious, asks who lived in Malibu; Chase replies that he did as a kid, but he assumed his parents had sold the place.</p><p>(later, at night)</p><p>The Leapfrog lands off the Pacific coast; the Runaways don't want to directly land on the Malibu house due to fear of setting off alarms. Xavin creates a watertight forcefield bubble for them to travel in, and Chase tells Old Lace that they'll be back for her when the coast is clear. Klara loves the excitement, though Chase would have preferred to land on the roof - there is a perfect spot for the Leapfrog.</p><p>Soon, they are on the beach, and Karolina welcomes Vic to Malibu. They walk up to the house and check the place out. It's a lot more desirable than their previous two hostels. Victor and Karolina decide to hack into the alarm system while Chase and Xavin check the front door. Nico and Klara go off to break into windows, but Molly attempts to break into the home on her own - being the strongest on the team.</p><p>Although Xavin manages to use her Mr. Fantastic arm into unlocking the door from the inside, she alerts a horde of security daemons that attack all the runaways; Karolina is grabbed by a prehistoric bird-like daemon, while Victor is attacked by a gorilla-like daemon with a slingshot. From the inside, Chase attempts to turn off a daemon by pressing a switch on the back of its head, but Molly arrives in time to smash it into the wall, breaking the daemon and the wall in the process. Karolina, becoming fed up of being carried around explodes the robot carrying her and wonders why they ever arrived at the house in Malibu.</p><p>Once the drama is over, the kids start getting rid of the evidence; Xavin shape-shifts into the form of handsome young man and informs the neighbors that they just moved in. Klara learns more about television and YouTube. Nico urges Chase to get a job; Chase, meanwhile, discovers the Stein's garage - there is a motorbike, a camper van and a VW bus.</p><p>(the next day, at the mall)</p><p>Molly, Nico, Karolina and Klara arrive at the base of the mall - Chase is applying for a job, at KZIT radio station hosted by his idol, Val Rhymin. Although Karolina is appalled Chase is applying for a job hosted by \"sexist pigs\", Nico doesn't care where he works so long as he works.</p><p>At the top of the mall, Val Rhymin is on air, slouched in his chair, while Chase watches through the public window. Val spots him and jokes to his listeners that it looks like one of the monkeys has escaped from the zoo to \"sip at the font of knowledge\". Val continues his speech about overthrowing the government... this angers the station manager, Bob, who warns Val not to say those things on the radio. The two enter a heated argument, resulting in Bob telling Val he's fired. Val turns away from Bob... but it is at this moment where Bob clutches his chest - he's going into a heart attack, but Val is utterly calm and pretends not to notice.</p><p>Chase does not notice Bob suffering, so he tells Val he idolises him and wants to work with him. Outside the office, Val notices (from the corner of his eye) a pained Bob disappearing over the balcony... he smiles at Chase and tells him his luck may be in. He thinks an opening's just come up.</p><p>As Bob falls towards his death, from below Klara, Molly, Nico and Karolina and the other shoppers look up after hearing a scream. Klara wastes no time springing into action. Calling out, \"Grow!\" the mall plantlife shoots up creating a jungle, catching Bob safely. While Klara helps Bob land and tells the plants to lie down, the other Runaways praise her and the four of them leave before the cops show up.</p><p>(later, at the Malibu home)</p><p>Victor finishes washing the Leapfrog in its new location. Molly, Klara, Nico and Karolina arrive, informing Xavin about their experience - just this moment, Chase arrives and asks why they left him alone at the mall. Nico, however, dodges the question and asks Chase why he let Bob fall from the balcony. Chase, angry with Nico, begins to have an arguement before Victor shuts him up... he hears something. Karolina's energies erupt as a blindling flash of light comes through the window... bursting through the wall, the Majesdanians have arrived for revenge.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>Characters making their first appearance in the series include Chase's new boss, Val Rhymin and the Majesdanians, deHalle, vaDanti, vaRikk and the General. The General isn't named until issue #6 (January 2009) as vaDrann.Val's boss, Bob appears, but he also dies the next issue.</p><p>The VW bus makes its first appearance this issue, but it will later return as a regular means of transport for Chase in issue #6 (January 2009).</p><p>In this issue, Xavin briefly shape-shifts into movie director Kevin Smith. The FCC and YouTube are also referenced. Val Rhymin plays a song by Led Zeppelin.</p>",

Broussard’s work is laid bare in this unique collection of the first three issues of this new volume.<br/><br/>Jackie Estacado, the current wielder of The Darkness power, joins forces with a brilliant scientist, who teaches the former Mob boss how to turn his curse into a blessing. Together, the duo overthrow a small South American country and turn its people into addicts of Nightfall, a synthetic drug made from The Darkness. But what Jackie doesn’t know is that the professor has a sinister, ulterior motive that will turn The Darkness powers against him, and he’ll be lucky if he gets out of this alive!<br/><br/>Even if you’ve read these issues before you’ll appreciate how Broussard, under Marc Silvestri’s guidance, has matured into a talented penciler in his own right.</p>",

In The Package, Logan must escape from an army of savage killers Deep in the heart of war-torn Africa - with a baby strapped to his chest! The infant daughter of an overthrown monarch is the only hope for a country's future, and the conquering warlord is determined to see her dead. Can Wolverine get her to the border alive? Or will his greatest failure doom an entire nation? In Better To Give, a heavily armed suicide cult - clad in elf outfits - has taken hostage a mid-Manhattan department store on Christmas Eve and is threatening to blow the place sky high. Among the shoppers: Logan, who's just itching to sink his (Santa) claws into someone after enduring the Yuletide rush. Should be easy for a damn-near invulnerable force of nature to save the day, right? Think again. All is not as it seems, as a spoiled billionaire's daughter is about to find out, and the true meaning of Christmas will be spelt out... in blood. In The House of Blood and Sorrow, Wolverine lies at the edge of death in a rural Nebraska cornfield after crashing to Earth in the wake of a clash with a giant robot at the edge of the atmosphere, lapsing in and out of a coma as his body desperately tries to heal. And that's when things really get bad. The men who sent the robot to destroy Wolverine have come to finish the job. The townsfolk who witnessed the crash have gathered up a mob to hunt down and destroy the alien that's landed. And Wolverine's fate just might rest in the hands of the strange little girl who first found him in that dark cornfield. A strange little girl with an affinity for taking care of odd creatures - and whose family holds a deep, dark secret hidden from the light of day. And in \"The Healing,\" Logan lies gutted in a Northwest forest, surrounded by wolves and clinging onto hope and sanity as his body goes about the complicated work of repairing itself. It's not as easy as you might think. Collects Wolverine #41 and #49, Giant-Size Wolverine #1 and X-Men Unlimited #12 <br /></i>",

            "description": "<p>Written by Duane Swierczynski Art by GIUSEPPE CAMUNCOLI Cover by KAARE ANDREWS<br /><br />  The minute he saw the dame, Orson Randall knew he was in for a heap of hurt -- all in. But he wouldn’t be the hard-boiled hero he was if he didn’t go sniffing after trouble. Hero? Randall stopped the laugh in his throat. Drowned it in a slug of bourbon. Randall’s no hero. 1920s Los Angeles just ain’t the time or the place for a guy like that. Ain’t the time or place for the Immortal Iron Fist. Orson Randall’s just trying to figure the angle. And if he has to unload his .45s to do it, so much the better. Orson Randall’s just in it for the skirt.<br /><br /><br />Summary;<br /><br />Orson retells the story of how he met the one woman who still leaves his lips burning. He had come to meet with a man named George...when she walked in. Her name was Galatea an her voice enchanted him, she knew what she wanted an she wanted him. Soon after taking her home she left, an Orson went to go an see what had happen to George. Finding George dead on the floor of his house, police burst into the house seeing him the murderer he breaks past the police. Knowing she had something to do with him being set up he went looking, following leads to a man named Simmon he searches his office finding pictures of the woman an other personas one of them being a Darlene she had used. Soon Simmon himself came his men at his cue began to beat Orson yet he was able to escape their grasp after a few blows an with his own tricks escaped. After escaping Orson donning his Ironfist persona an mask made his way back to Galatea apartment only to find three woman saying their Galatea? The three women powers enchanted him again an almost took him over until a woman in red came to his rescue (Corny yeah) it was Darlene. As soon as they were in the free they were again surrounded by men in hooded cloaks under the leadership of one man...Simmon. Simmons cult followed an worshiped Baba Fu, the woman behind Ironfist Galatea was to be Baba Fu's vessal for this world. Doing as she is told Darlene puts Ironfist under her thrall an he is tossed around the room an beaten by the followers.  But soon Ironfist took out the two things they had forgotten...his two .45s.  The firefight began an soon an explosion erupted within the mansion, finding Darlene he wraps his arms around her only to feel the cold embrace of a knife in his back. Darlene tells him she wanted to be their queen an that all he was doing was stopping that, as Ironfist attempts at swaying her from her decision telling her that they killed her father the floor gives way an Ironfist tries to grab for Darlene but she falls to a firey grave. <br /><br />After the incident Ironfist sits again in a coffeeshop contemplating how he could not save Darlene while the three women swoon over him telling him to put the mask back on. Grateful for him saving them from Simmon they never left his side.</p>",

When the U.S. Team arrives on the asteroid, they discover the remains of an abandoned alien mining camp. But when the U.S. ship is sabotaged and crew members go missing, it becomes clear they're not alone on the asteroid. Stranded, the remaining crew members must band together to survive the monstrous inhabitants on the asteroid, find a way off the rock and save Earth which now sits directly in the path of destruction. In the process, they discover a deep dark secret contained within the asteroid. It holds the key to both their destruction and to their salvation. But unearthing it will change the fate of humanity forever.</i></p>",

But when the Demi-Gods pushed the mighty Giants into oblivion, they became the lords of the planet. Nevertheless, mere humans were not the appropriate companion for the demi-gods and they built Asgard as a haven for all that was blessed. When the Giants were aware of this, they knew it was the moment for payback and what could be sweeter than use Thor himself as their pawn of revenge.<br /><br />As Asgard fell, dark creatures began invading the human Empire. Even with the help of Thor, now calling himself the Stormbringer, the Empire was impotent to stop its demise caused by the dark horde led by Master Mayhem. Now, Leviticus Cross stands as the last remaining bastion of the Empire, but a growing fear against superhuman beings is spreading among its inhabitants unaware the maybe these rejects from society are the only hope for mankind.</i>",

When the super-undead stumble into the MU from the Man-Thing's Nexus of All Realities, all of Florida is quarantined against the zombie plague. Time is quickly running out for a cure, so the Initiative sends a most unlikely group of heroes into the Zombieverse on a desperate mission to find the one item they need before the whole MU is consumed!</i></p><h3><strong>Summary:</strong></h3><p>The Command consisting of Aquarian, Conquistador, Jennifer Kale, and Siege are prowling Citrusville Florida at the Swamp Monster Tour grounds. They got reports of zombies in the area including one in a costume. The Command stumbles at the zombie area and all of a sudden a zombie bits Siege in the face. The other Zombies then tear Conquistador's body apart. All of a sudden the zombie version of Deadpool pops out, injuring Jennifer Kale's arms to prevent her from using magic and bites Aquarian on the neck. Jennifer Kale turns on a giant propeller and signals to Aquarian, whom then blasts Deadpool into it which slices him in many pieces. After that Aquarian shields himself as he puts himself into suspended animation to try to purge the infection. The zombie Siege then tries to eat Jennifer Kale but Siege's mechanical body turns on him and destroys his head.</p><p>Elsewhere a zombie leaves the swamp only to be killed by Man-Thing.</p><p>At A.R.M.O.R. Morbius has become the head scientist. He gets a message from zombie Deadpool and claims that Deadpool lead the Command to the swamp as a trap and that Deadpool or the virus as entered the real world and wants to spread the zombie virus to super humans in order to spread faster. At this point Morbius is trying to find a cure for the zombie virus that came from the zombie dimension which Deadpool escaped from, but he needs blood from a non-bitten person from that dimension to make the cure work.</p><p>A.R.M.O.R. director Charles Little Sky then gets Machine Man and Jocasta(who haven't seen each other since they defeated Ulton with the Thing), and both of them transport to the zombie dimension to get the blood they need.</p><p>Morbius then goes into a hidden room in the lab. In the lab is the real Morbius beaten up, bound, and being injected with an anticoagulant. The other Morbius turns out to be the zombie version of Morbius who is undercover.</p>",

            "description": "<p>WHAT IS THE SECRET REASON WOLVERINE JOINED THE X-MEN?</p><p>The X-Men event of the fall begins in this one-shot! For years, Logan has been a man without a past, whose memories existed only as conflicting fragments. And Charles Xavier has been a master of his own mind and others. Now the tables are turned, and as WOLVERINE struggles to rescue his son, DAKEN, from the evil and darkness that have consumed him, PROFESSOR X comes face-to-face with the most terrifying secret of all!</p><p>Beginning here and continuing in the pages of X-MEN LEGACY and WOLVERINE: ORIGINS this month and next, ORIGINAL SIN is sure to turn your expectations on their head!</p><p>Also featuring a reprint of \"First Night\" by Chris Claremont and John Bolton, originally published in Classic X-Men #1</p><h4>SPOILERS</h4><h4>Chapter 1</h4><p>The issue starts with Wolverine remembering back when he was first asked to join the X-men, and that he was the only one of the new group that actually knew why he was there. Back to the present Logan meets up with an old friend who is hiding from the Chinese Government, he asks of the man known as Tso Ren Wu to keep an eye on his son Daken and make sure he stays calm. And that if Logan doesn`t return to take him off the grid.</p><p>Soon Wolverine makes his way back to the mansion and finds Emma and Scott, smelling the scent of Charles, Wolverine becomes enraged. He screams at Scott that they, both, should have told Logan that Charles was still around in the land of the living. He attacks Scott and Emma breaks them up, Logan states that Scott is still letting his women fight for him. A statement that causes another short argument, before Emma breaks it up again, she puts her hands on Logan, only for him, to swat her away like a fly calling her by White Queen. She asks \"This is how its going to be?\" And Logan continues to walk saying \"No...its just the way it is.\" Walking out of the hanger bay.</p><p>Back in Tokyo Wolverine makes his way through the city, while Tso and Daken are kept in the dark from other eyes from a distraction by Tso's men.</p><p>Miss Sinister sits in a diner/bar watching Wolverine.</p><h4>Chapter 2</h4><p>As he walks the streets he can smell Charles and soon runs into him. Charles was waiting for Logan an sipping on a glass of coffee, Logan sits down an stares at Charles.</p><p>In another part of Tokyo, Daken is with Tso and a woman, he attempts to leave, but the woman stops him from doing so. But, soon apologies for her brash behavior, as he looks out the window he gets a pounding headache as someone speaks to him within his mind its Miss Sinister. She calls him to the roof, he asks her what she is doing and she tells him \"Looking for you.\" that he is a hard man to find. Not believing her nor knowing who she is he tries to dismiss her telling her he is waiting for a friend to which she responds \"Logan is no friend of yours.\" that he was the one who did this to him. He doesn't believe her and that Logan was the man to help him out of the \"cave\" he was in. Leaving Miss sinister on the roof she says that he will burn.</p><p>Back with Logan an Charles, Logan begins to tell more about Daken and that he is his son. Charles is amazed that Logan has a son. Then as the discussion continues Logan asks for Charles to wipe Dakens mind of all the brainwashing and all the mess in his mind. Charles barks back that he cant do that, that he has done it too often and its destroyed people. Logan wants Daken's mind wiped so that afterward he can choose to either be a killer or something better.</p><p>Charles still not wanting to do it says no that he WILL NOT do what Logan asks. Logan pops out his claws and \"I wasn't asking.\"</p><p>Above where Daken is staying two choppers sound off above it, and with a grin a pilot talking with Miss Sinister drops two napalms onto the home. The woman with Daken tries to warn him before the blast but is too late, and as the explosion erupts she is devoured in the flames. The choppers land and the men walk into the inferno looking for the remains of Daken only to fined a infuriated Daken and he ends both their lives at the ends of his claws. Miss Sinister walks in, Daken screams at her if she was the one to do it. She nods telling him yes that it was to show him what he truly is and if it makes him sad that he should stay an cry about it , but if it reminds him of old times that he should come an play with her.</p><p>Logan asks Charles what he sees? Referring to the reflection in his claws. Charles says his claws in a sarcastic remark, and Logan asks again. Charles finally replies \"I see me\" he asks Logan if hes trying to show him something about himself. Logan says no that hes showing him the truth, that the professor made him. Broke him into little pieces and put him back together from those pieces. Charles doesn't understand stating that the memories were always there that they were there the first time they met. Logan tells him to read his mind, and Charles says no. Logan chuckles saying \"You afraid to find out the truth the whole story that. That that day they first met he let him in the door, knowing full well I was sent to kill you.\"</p><p>Too be Continued.</p>",

The hard parts of life are love and hope. From a touching relationship between Jonathan and his aging great aunt, to an inebriated evening with an amorous, octogenarian dwarf, to the devastating aftermath of 9/11, Ames's first original graphic novel, with gritty, poignant art by Dean Haspiel (THE QUITTER), tells a story at once hilarious, excruciating, bizarre and universal, about how our lives fall to pieces and the enduring human struggle to put things back together again.</i><i><br/></i> <br/>Hardcover Release Date: October 01, 2008 <br/>Softcover Release Date: September 16, 2009",

Following directly on from last month's SUPERMAN'S PAL, JIMMY OLSEN SPECIAL #1, we learn the fantastic and sometimes terrible past of one of DC's most mysterious heroes. How did the first clone of the Golden Age Guardian come into existence at the hands of the Cadmus Project? We'll also introduce a mysterious young girl the Guardian has sworn to protect – even at the expense of the Cadmus Project, and, if need be, his very life</i>! <br /> <br />The comic begins when Jimmy Olsen shows up at Jim Harper's (The Guardian) home to ask him questions about Cadmus.Harper starts the story from the very beginning.As people know Cadmus had been creating all types of different creatures but the one that Harper had found was wearing a Legion of Superheroes ring and that's when he got suspicious.The book then drifts into the effects of being a clone of the real Jim Harper as he takes Jimmy back through his origin.When Harper looks further into the Cadmus project he not only finds out that Cadmus planned to destroy Superman but that they were making monstrous clones from the same DNA that he was spawned from.To preserve his own humanity he destroyed the clones..burned them alive.From the depictions shown afterwards one is to assume that Harper's daughter whom we meet during Jimmy's exit is just a clone as well.At the conclusion of it all Jimmy is still proud to know Harper and to have spoke with him,he still views him as a great hero although he thinks his legacy was built on fabrication and as for Harper he plans to come face to face with his \"father's killer\" the Assassin Jonathan Drew..to gain some closure.",

Prepare for some disturbing imagery in this first issue of the three-parter. Smith takes this pool of villains and pits them against each other while all of them have the Batman and the police to also worry about.</p><p>The major plotline is that someone has taken the Joker's poison and cut down with other ingredients to create a new club drug called Chuckles. It's worse than Xstacy and is taking over the street scene.

            "description": "<p><i>Long before his memories were restored, the X-Man known as Wolverine spent years seeking to unlock the mysteries of his past. Some of those memories were best left forgotten. Join Charles Xavier as he journeys deep into Wolverine's mind on a quest for answers that will shed new light on one of the darkest periods of Logan's life -- his days in the Weapon X program! It's a brand-new look at the horrifying history of Marvel's most prominent mutant! PLUS: Each issue features a 10-page back-up story featuring an important player from Wolverine's past! First up, an untold tale of Wolvie's arch-nemesis, the mutant madman known as Sabretooth!</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><h4>Part 1, Don't Look Back in Anger</h4><p>Logan approaches Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. In his mind he knows that he has found a place to call home. As he draws nearer, Kitty informs him that the Danger Room is prepped for a practice session. Wolverine bows out of practice in order to have a one-on-one session with Xavier. He muses about how everyone else knows who they are. He, on the other hand, is still searching. Sitting down with Professor Xavier, the two discuss the next possible solution to figuring out where Wolverine came from. Xavier has tried everything. He does have an idea, though. He'd like Wolverine to accompany him into Wolverine's own mind, a dangerous idea, since Xavier will need total trust and cooperation, something hard to come by with someone as capricious as Wolverine is.</p><p>Xavier begins the experiment. Once in Wolverine's mind, the two men find themselves trapped in a cubic, stone room. Xavier explains that the walls have been erected by Wolverine himself. Not one to be held back by barriers, Wolverine attempts to rip the walls down. The stone is easy enough, but there is a tougher barrier immediately behind it. Xavier explains that Wolverine's mind isn't so easy to navigate. Wolverine's subconscious must have some things it wants to keep hidden. Wolverine exerts all he has and finally rips through the outer wall. He and Xavier step through the hole to find shards, fragments, of Wolverine's memories: fighting the Hulk, running with wolves, and hanging out with Captain America, among others. Wolverine is stumped, sure that some of the memories must be false since some look to be from ages in the past. Xavier hypothesizes that Wolverine must be older than originally thought, something aided by Wolverine's healing factor. Wolverine can't place many of the memories. Sabretooth steps from the recesses of Wolverine's mind and offers to help.</p><p>The two battle, but when Wolverine goes for the kill, he learns that Sabretooth really is just a figment of his mind. Sabretooth then relates a simple story in which he and Wolverine had been on the same team years back. Memories flood and Wolverine sees his abduction at the hands of some goons. He asks where he was taken and Sabretooth shows a large penitentiary-like place. Sabretooth refuses to enter; he's had his fill with the place. Wolverine and Xavier enter and see Wolverine's body in the Weapon X tanks. This story continues in the next issue.</p><h4>The Recruit</h4><p>Sabretooth approaches an old cabin in the Canadian wilderness. He crumples up an invitation and tries to shake the feeling that he is about to be drafted into some cause. In the cabin, Sabretooth is greeted by a shadowed, bald man. The stranger acknowledges that Sabretooth has a reputation for tracking, a point that led to inviting him in the first place. The stranger then comments on Sabretooth's past, like when he went rogue on a Team X mission or about his father abusing him. The stranger then explains that Sabretooth's many gifts have prepared him for the stranger's program. Sabretooth refuses to think he can do anything worthwhile, but the stranger simply says it is in Sabretooth's hands to prove the world wrong about who he's become. The program, says the stranger, is to help find people. The stranger slides a folder marked \"Classified: Weapon X,\" and explains that Sabretooth knows the person to be located first. Opening the file, Sabretooth sees Wolverine's face and gets angry. He charges the stranger but freezes in mid-stride. The stranger turns out to be Xavier. He wheels himself out of harm's way and puts into Sabretooth's mind that the meeting had never happened. When Sabretooth awakens, he feels as if he's just woken from a bad dream. He leaves, mulling over a though Xavier left in his mind: a war is coming.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Marvel Comics takes on this classic American tale adapted from L. Frank Baum. Writer Eric Shanower and artist Skottie Young have teamed up to produce a spectacularly appealing series great for all ages. In issue 1 of 8, Dorothy and Toto experience the tornado sweeping their house to the land of Oz. The house crushes one of the wicked witches.

But when a fateful spider-bite gives the young rabble-rouser Peter Parker the power to fight the mobster who killed his Uncle Ben, will even that be enough? It’s a tangled web of Great Depression pulp, with familiar faces like you’ve never seen them before!

In Asgard, though…no one can quite remember WHAT happened to him. How did he live? How did he die? And why does everyone in Asgard remember it differently? There's trickery at hand so vile even Loki joins Thor in trying to unravel it. Some comics are giant-sized. Some are king-sized. Only THIS comic can be called GOD-SIZED! By Matt Fraction (THOR: AGES OF THUNDER) and a roster of all-star artists including Doug Braithwaite (SECRET INVASION: THOR), Dan Brereton (IMMORTAL IRON FIST ANNUAL) and Marko Djurdjevic (THOR #7-8)!</i></p><p>The tale of Skurge the Executioner is known to all in Asgard, as is how Skurge died single-handedly defending the Asgardians from the forces of Hela. Thor encounters Balder who is musing over the details of the tale. The two gods realize that their recollection of the life of Skurge was vastly different. Thor immediately senses Loki's trickery. Upon interrogating Loki, Thor realizes that her recollection of the tale is different than either of theirs.</p><p>The three embark for Hel to determine what actually happened to Skurge. There they find exactly how deep the trickery runs as even Hela herself finds that her memory of Skurge has been tampered with. Upon exiting Hel the three find that they are mysteriously riding horses where they weren't before, and their attire has changed as well (Loki is back to being a man). After battling the dark elves and then a frost giant (and going through another transformation) they find themselves at Yggdrasil, the world tree. Enchantress is at the base of the Yggdrasil, stricken with grief and trying to reform Skurge from the roots of the world tree itself. The changes in their memories had been caused by Enchantress tampering with the very essence of the nine worlds and threatening the existence of all.</p><p>Through Loki's trickery, Thor is able to defeat the Enchantress and destroy the still-forming body of Skurge in the world tree, saving all worlds.</p>",

But in the aftermath of the big blow-out, things start to go horribly wrong for all of them. Jessie is troubled by nasty memories she's been suppressing for years, while her best friend Nick Philo has become an un-person: Nobody outside their tight-knit little clique can remember seeing him before, and his records have been erased from the college's computers. At first, it doesn't seem like a big deal, but it becomes increasingly obvious that one of them is not what he appears to be. Chock full of ruthless characters with hidden agendas, FAKER takes place during freshman year in college; the ultimate time of reinvention, where, if you're up for it, you can lie, cheat and fake your way through almost anything.  </i>",

When a crew of sketchy vampires takes up residence in Dullsville's lonely graveyard, Alexander finds this motley bunch led by his very own blood-sucking cousin, Claude Sterling. Shocking! Claude and his creepy crew can only spell out more problems for the pair, especially when Raven finds them in daylight in the very last place she could ever imagine.

What you do with your new lives is up to me!\" And what this orb called \"Gantz\" intends to do with their lives is make them play games of death, hunting all kinds of odd aliens, along with a bunch of other ordinary citizens who've recently met a tragic semi-end. The missions they embark upon are often dangerous. Many die-and die again.

But the cold is the least of the population's problems. In Los Angeles rival gangs fight it out for control of what was previously known as the City of Angels. Law and order has completely collapsed and the government, stretched thin as it is by troubles elsewhere, is afraid it will lose the city.Unfortunately, back up is light, and the beleaguered military can only send four marines to turn the tide. Fortunately, they are all that is needed. One of these four, Ricky Di Santos, is returning to his birthplace, the city he left to escape a girl he once loved. But they are destined to meet again, this time on the battlefield.</em></p><p>The series is broken up into four stories, each centered on one of the four main characters and all set in locations that it would be hard to imagine covered in snow. Major Jonathon Carson seeks out his lost son in the icy tundra of Las Vegas, Ricky Di Santos finds himself meeting an old flame in the battlefield of a snow covered Los Angeles, Jed Giffin catches up with his self-centered sister in a freezing Dallas and Sinead O Brien takes to the frozen seas of Miami with a friend from her former life. Each story looks at the suffering caused in these very different settings and examines how people cope in an environment where each day is a struggle for survival. However, there is also plenty of action as the marines deal with those who would attempt to profit from this new world in which America finds itself.</p>",

A Marvel Comics mainstay since 1964, Daredevil got a new lease on life in a landmark 1979-1983 run by writer-penciler Frank Miller and inker-penciler Klaus Janson, whose daring reinvention of the character quickly made Miller one of the biggest and most influential stars in the comic-book industry. Miller put his own stamp on established cast members such as reporter Ben Urich, femme fatale Black Widow, mad assassin Bullseye, the saw-fisted Gladiator, and monstrous crime boss Kingpin. Miller also introduced Daredevil's mysterious mentor Stick, deadly ninja foes the Hand, and Matt's long-lost love Elektra, a beautiful assassin who would become one of Marvel's most memorable characters. Mixing traditional super-heroics with mysterious martial artistry, doomed romance, and dark personal drama, Miller's character-defining DD run is collected across three titanic trade paperbacks! Collecting Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #27-28, and Daredevil #158-161 and #163-172</i></p>",

The contents run from extended stories like Derek Hunter's 15-page Powerpuff Girls-esque goofy-girl-hero comic Gamma Rae to one-page posters and smirking faux-ads like Danny Hellman's sly, smirking ant-farm solicitation. While there are some kid-friendly stories, the tone runs generally darker, with ninja battles, noir murder mysteries, ghosts, vampires, monsters, zombies, and robot-on-robot violence cropping up amid the odd, alternative superheroes. Virtually all the work is colorful, entertaining, and immediate, with a strong sense of experimentation and play throughout; it's hard, in this rich an environment, for any one work to stand out. But Andy Kuhn's \"Mexican Wrestler Funnies,\" in which two wrestlers trade Monty Python-esque barbs like \"It is I who will make love to your corpse, with a Waring blender… set to puree!\" is pretty hilarious, and Adrian Dominguez and Matthew Weldon's anime-influenced teen-hero story \"Ellie Saves The World\" is particularly gorgeous. But then, the wide variety of tones and visual styles guarantees something for just about everyone… A- --The Onion AV Club</p><p>The sheer diversity in style of art, lettering, layout -- everything -- is enough to keep neophytes and nerds alike rapt. The work is at turns touching, hilarious, suspenseful and then some. This is a fine collection. 9/10 --Under the Radar Magazine</p><p>[POPGUN is] a comic book mixtape that will keep the art junkies very happy ... acrazy collection of cutting edge comic book art. POPGUN pulls selections from some of the top indie artists in comics ... Aspiring artists and fans will want to flip through POPGUN for the inspiring images that demonstrate just how much talent is floating around comics these days. --Blair Butler, G4's Attack of the Show</p>",

But in typical Ultimate Universe style, human failings and political intrigue get in the way, leading to a primal battle between humanity and technology as the two titanic Ultimates square off in a ferocious test of opposing strengths. It's a battle between the Hulk, the most awesome emblem of brute force in existence, and Iron Man, whose keenly enhanced physiology represents the bleeding edge of science and technology. And in any such battle, expect massive collateral damage! As the political intrigue and long-buried secrets are slowly revealed in writer Warren Ellis' own inimitable way, expect to be shocked, surprised and overcome with the kind of seat-of-your-pants, comic-reading glee that is a hallmark of the Ultimate reading experience.

            "description": "<p><i>THE ACCLAIMED 2008 DEBUT, BACK IN PRINT IN A 2010 SOFTCOVER!</i></p><p><i><b>Abandoned Cars</b> is Tim Lane’s first collection of graphic short stories, noir-ish narratives that are united by their exploration of the great American mythological drama by way of the desperate and haunted characters that populate its pages. Lane’s characters exist on the margins of society—alienated, floating in the void between hope and despair, confused but introspective. Some of them are experiencing the aftermath of an existential car crash—those surreal moments after a car accident, when time slows down and you’re trying to determine what just happened and how badly you’re hurt. Others have gone off the deep end, or were never anywhere but the deep end. Some are ridiculous, others dignified in their efforts to struggle to make sense of, and cope with, the absurdities, outrages, ghosts, and poisons in their lives.</i></p><p><i>The writing is straightforward, the stories mainstream but told in a pulpy idiom with an existential edge, often in the first person, reminiscent of David Goodis’s or Jim Thompson’s prose or of films like <b>Pick-Up on South Street or Out of the Past</b>. Visually, Lane’s drawing is in a realistic mode, reminiscent of Charles Burns, that heightens the tension in stories that veer between naturalism on the one hand and the comical, nightmarish, and hallucinatory on the other. Here, American culture is a thrift store and the characters are thrift store junkies living among the clutter. It’s an America depicted as a subdued and haunted Coney Island, made up of lost characters—boozing, brawling, haplessly shooting themselves in the face, and hopping freight trains in search of Elvis.</i></p><p><i><b>Abandoned Cars</b> is an impressive debut of a major young American cartoonist.</i></p>",

Who also happens to be the alleged reincarnation of King Arthur. Ellie couldn't be happier to have Will in her life, but she's also worried that his estrangement from his parents is tearing him apart. To make matters worse, Will's doubt that he really is King Arthur could prevent the Merlin Prophecy--an age of enlightenment--from occurring. Can Ellie convince Will to believe in something that even she isn't sure about? And more importantly, can she get him to give his parents another chance?</i>",

But the two begin to discover that they have more in common than they first thought---and Takaaki embarks on a journey to find out just who is the real Sonoh!</i></p><p>Chapter 1 to 4.</p>",

Enjoy the MPD-Psycho series for all of its absurd twists, sci-fi touches, and inventive torture scenes, but you'll also be mesmerized by the plethora of odd conspiracies and case files found in Otsuka and Tajima's uncontrollable, urban horrorshow. In MPD-Psycho Volume One, police detective Kobayashi Yousuke's life is changed forever after a serial killer notices something \"special\" about him. That same killer mutilates Kobayashi's wife and kick-starts a \"multiple personality battle\" within Kobayashi that pushes him into a complex tempest of interconnected deviants and evil forces. Earning praise for its consistently shocking plotlines and Tajima's clean, arresting art style, MPD-Psycho is the manga event of the decade!</i> </p><h2>Chapter Titles </h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>File : 01 - Yosuke Kobayashi</li><li>File : 02 - Kazuhiko Amamiya</li><li>File : 03 - Tomoyo Tanabe</li><li>File : 04 - Flower Angel</li><li>File : 05 - Suguru Ueno</li><li>File : 06 - Kiyoshi Murata</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>Born during the sunrise--an auspicious beginning--the Azumas’ newborn son is named Hikaru, which means “light”. But during one play date, his mother notices that her son is slightly different from the other children. In the alternately heartwarming and bittersweet tale, a young mother tries to cope with both the overwhelming discovery of her child’s autism and the trials of raising him while keeping her family together. This is a story that resonates not only for those whose families have been affected by autism, but also for all past, present, and future parents.</i></p><h2>Back Blurb</h2><p><i>To new mother Sachiko Azuma, her baby boy is the light of her life. Accordingly, she names him Hikaru, Japanese for \"to be bright.\" Eager to raise her son, Sachiko gradually begins to notice that Hikaru seems a bit different from the other children. He is reluctant to be held or hugged, and his growth and development appear slow. Sachiko's suspicions are confirmed when it is suggested that Hikari, at a year-and-a-half, may be deaf. A specialist, however, reaches a different diagnosis: autism.</i></p><p><i>With the Light: Raising an Autistic Child is a simultaneously poignant and heartwarming story of a young mother attempting to cope with an increasingly common affliction. Originally published in Japan under the title Hikari To Tomoni, With the Light has been universally recognized for its sensitive portrayal of autism, winning an Excellence Prize for manga at the eighth annual Japan Media Arts Festival. The story also went on to be adapted as a television drama, which won Best Drama, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Newcomer awards at the forty-first Television Drama Academy Awards in Japan in 2004.This edition marks the first time With the Light has been made available to English-speaking audiences.</i></p><p>Collects and translates volumes 1 &amp; 2 of Hikari To Tomoni.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Birth/Infancy</h4><ul><li>Episode 1</li><li>Episode 2</li><li>Episode 3</li></ul><h4>Preschool Years</h4><ul><li>Episode 1</li><li>Episode 2</li><li>Episode 3</li></ul><h4>Early Elementary Years</h4><ul><li>Episode 1</li><li>Episode 2</li><li>Episode 3</li><li>Episode 4</li><li>Episode 5</li><li>Episode 6</li></ul><h4>With Dada by Dada's Mother, Ayako Okuhira (Text Only Story)<br />Nobu's World by Reiko Maruoka (Text Only Story)</h4>",

Welcome back to the 70s and 80s because the first Triple and a half Creature Feature of the new millennium is set to begin! This issue features three and a half scintillating tales of monsterous horror done right - over the top and gratuitous with a super-cool soundtrack. (Readers are responsible for providing their own tunes.) Grab a date, leave the kids at home, and stuff as many friends in your trunk as possible for out of this world terror in Abducted by Chris Yost, hot girls and feathery friends in Hooters by CB Cebulski, creepy crawlies in Why Did It Have To Be Spiders? by Andy Schmidt, and the first half of the rocktacular Rockenstein by Brian Smith, a tale so demented the drive-in is only willing to screen the first half of it lest they get shut down altogether for public indecency! </i>",

However, her real money is something she likes even less than being a dominatrix. Ever since childhood, Misaki has had the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, and that talent is put to use by the Livelihood Protection Agency, who pairs Misaki with Souichiro Kadotake, a martial artist who happens to be deathly afraid of ghosts.

            "description": "<p><i> </i><i>An  eclectic and stylish collection of comics from Rian Hughes, renowned  illustrator and designer in a luxury embossed hardcover. All the stories  here have been recoloured or relettered to show them at their best.  Long before he discovered the Apple Mac, Hughes was collaborating with  Eisner Award-winner Grant Morrison on the classic British character Dan  Dare, producing a post-modern classic which sets an ageing, retired Dare  against a modern British landscape he no longer understands. Versatile  and unpredictable, Hughes makes full use of his clean graphic style on  The Science Service, written by John Freeman, and a looser, moody noir  palette on Raymond Chandler's Goldfish, here adapted by writer Tom  DeHaven. Really &amp; Truly, another Morrison collaboration, is a  high-octane psychedelic road-trip torn from the pages of cult comic  2000AD. As well as sketchbook pages, merchandise and rare strips - many  never seen before or out of print for over a decade - the book features  an introduction by comics guru Paul Gravett.</i></p>",

Like a number of his initial stories, \"Pocket\" is actually drawn with realistic human beings instead of blank-faced animal characters — a true revelation for Jason fans. In fact, this book showcases three distinct styles: his earliest \"realistic\" drawing style (used to unsettling effect in some particularly creepy stories), an intermediate \"bighead\" cartoony style that still features humans (used for both humor and drama), and the \"funny-animal\" style he's now best known for.</i></p>",

Attracting equal parts derision and praise (the latter from the likes of R.

He has influenced a generation of cartoonists, from <b>RAW</b> to Fort Thunder and back again.</i></p><p><i>This book, the first retrospective of Hayes’ career ever published, features the best of his underground comics output alongside paintings, covers, and artifacts rarely seen by human eyes — as well as astounding, previously unprinted comics from his teenage years and movie posters for his numerous homemade films. <b>The Art and Comix of Rory Hayes</b> also serves as a biography and critique with a memoir of growing up with Rory by his brother, the illustrator Geoffrey Hayes, and a career-spanning essay by Edwin Pouncey (a.k.a. Savage Pencil). Also included is a rare interview with Hayes himself.</i></p>",

The mysterious disease that the teens struggle with becomes a metaphor in the ordinary lives of the students in their classes, as they try to work their way through their friendships and romances.

A girl grown in a lab from the finest genetic material, she has been trained since her birth fifteen years ago to be the U.S. government’s ultimate espionage weapon. But now she is given an assignment that will test her abilities to the utmost — high school.</i></p><p><i>In order to uncover an evil plot, the government sends Luna to a prominent high school to pose as a student. Luna’s training has left her completely unprepared to handle the stresses and strains of ordinary teenage relationships — making friends, creating rivals, and having her first big crush on bad boy Jonah, the son of her arch-nemesis, Count Von Brucken! Making matters worse, Luna’s \"father\" is the overly warm-and-fuzzy Dr. Andy and her \"mother\" is the always business-like, unemotional Control.</i></p>",

In addition to the works written by Friedman, Fun includes many collaborations with his longtime partner K. Bidus, as well as Harvey Pekar (American Splendor), Mark Newgarden (We All Die Alone), and Bruce Handy, among others. Also included is artwork from the notorious Topps Bubble Gum Card series Toxic High, as well as art from the card sets Beauties and Cuties and Ed Wood Players. </em></p><p>Foreword by Daniel Clowes.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em><strong>Fuzz &amp; Pluck: Splitsville</strong> tells the hilariously bizarre adventures of Pluck, an irritable and featherless rooster, and his best pal, the awkwardly unsocialized but lovable teddy bear known as Fuzz. These two usually inseparable and co-dependent misfits find themselves suddenly separated and alone. Pluck vows to establish his place in the world's pecking order by becoming a champion gladiator, while the more demure Fuzz finds himself a POW in a stuffed animal collection, only to escape and befriend a mercurial ferryman who recruits him for an impossible task. These absurdities pile on and eventually converge in a fatal collision course that reunites our heroes.</em></p><p><em><strong>Fuzz &amp; Pluck</strong> is an odd, and unusually original graphic novel, a \"funny animal\" comic that is surprisingly human. Rich with pathos, wit, farce, existentialism and drama, often cruel, always funny, this superficially ridiculous struggle for survival is an <strong>Alice in Wonderland</strong> for grown-ups that reaches absurdly delightful heights. As <strong>Simpsons</strong> creator Matt Groening says, \"This epic tale of a hapless li'l bear and his defeathered friend is why I love comics. All hail the peculiar Fuzz &amp; Pluck and their creator, Ted Stearn!\"</em></p><p><em>Ted Stearn is longtime storyboard artist for animation. <strong>Fuzz &amp; Pluck</strong> is the author's most personal work, showcasing his vivid imagination and meticulous draughtsmanship.</em></p>",

He clearly fashions himself a genius, writing with a faux-aristocratic air, and it is presumably his belief in his own genius that leads him to want to share his knowledge with the world. Each page features information such as \"It hardly needs mentioning that riding a pony is no intellectual triumph.... If riding a pony is so fantastic, why have I never read of any renowned pony-riding genius? It is because such a person does not exist, making it a foolish waste of time unworthy of attention.\" These pearls of wisdom are lettered in an elegant, almost obsessive fashion, entirely hand-crafted and bedecked with Ionic columns and fleurs-de-lis.</em></p>",

Kilimanjaro.</i></p><p><i>The book also includes \"What Do Pretty People Think About?,\" a pathetic bit of speculative envy in which Holcombe muses about the condition of physical beauty: What do pretty people think about? Do pretty people feel pain like normal people? Do pretty people even have souls? Finally, the all-new \"Hails at Sea\" is a collage of Holcombe's troubled dreams over a three-year period. Vampires, unfortunate sexual metaphors, talking fish and Tiny Tim all make an appearance in this tribute to the return of the repressed.</i></p>",

But soon after they build themselves their dream home far from the madding crowd, their baby was abducted! Geary retraces all the different highly publicized events, blackmail notes, false and otherwise, as well as the string of colorful characters wanting to 'help'', some of which actually successfully snookered the beleaguered hero. A fascinating story, of course without a fully satisfactory conclusion, replete with savory details and unsavory people as only Geary can masterfully relate with his understated dark humor.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Harvey Kurtzman changed the face of American humor when he created the legendary <strong>MAD</strong> comic. As editor and chief writer from its inception in 1952, through its transformation into a slick magazine, and until he left <strong>MAD</strong> in 1956, he influenced an entire generation of cartoonists, comedians, and filmmakers. In 1962, he co-created the long-running <strong>Little Annie Fanny</strong> with his long-time artistic partner Will Elder for <strong>Playboy</strong>, which he continued to produce until his virtual retirement in 1988.</em></p><p><em>Between <strong>MAD</strong> and <strong>Annie Fanny</strong>, Kurtzman’s biographical summaries will note that he created and edited three other magazines, <strong>Trump</strong>, <strong>Humbug</strong>, and <strong>Help!</strong>, but, whereas his <strong>MAD</strong> and <strong>Annie Fanny</strong> are readily available in reprint form, his major satirical work in the interim period is virtually unknown. <strong>Humbug</strong>, which had poor distribution, may be the least known, but to those who treasure the rare original copies, it equals or even exceeds <strong>MAD</strong> in displaying Kurtzman’s creative genius. <strong>Humbug</strong> was unique in that it was actually published by the artists who created it: Kurtzman and his cohorts from <strong>MAD</strong> Will Elder, Jack Davis, and Al Jaffee, were joined by universally acclaimed cartoonist Arnold Roth. With no publisher above them to rein them in, this little band of creators produced some of the most trenchant and engaging satire of American culture ever to appear on American newsstands. At last, the entire run of 11 issues of <strong>Humbug</strong> is being reprinted in a deluxe format, much of it reproduced from the original art, allowing even owners of the original cheaply-printed issues to experience the full impact for the first time.</em></p>",

Bursting with full-color drawings, comics, and collages, autobiographical sections and gentle creative guidance, each page is an invigorating example of exactly what it is: \"The ordinary is extraordinary.\" Lynda Barry explores the depths of the inner and outer realms of creation and imagination, where play can be serious, monsters have purpose, and not knowing is an answer unto itself. How do objects summon memories? What do real images feel like? These types of questions permeate the pages of What It Is, with words attracting pictures and conjuring places through a pen that first and foremost keeps on moving.</em></p><p><em>Her insight and sincerity will tackle the most persistent of inhibitions, calling back every kid who quit drawing to again feel alive at the experiential level. Comprised of completely new material, this is her first Drawn &amp; Quarterly book.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Nominated for 2 Eisner Awards for best web comic, winner of an Expozine award, and hailed by Salon.com and the Montreal Mirror, Matthew Forsythe's Ojingogo is already highly anticipated. Exuding simplicity in design and narrative, Ojingogo is an illustrated, 'Jim Woodring-esque' dreamscape of abstracts and events. The otherworldly pantomime about a girl, her squid, and the creatures and calamities they experience together, is an intrinsically expressive and deeply rewarding journey. Drawing from Forsythe's Korean influences, Ojingogo is accessible for all ages, tossing aside traditional narrative conventions in favour of creating its own world, language and rules that anyone can find a home of their own in.</em></p>",

Like a Lynchian take on Alice in Wonderland, Jessica Farm opens with an exterior of what could be any Midwestern farmhouse: once inside, we track our titular heroine as she bounds out of bed on Christmas and goes about her morning routine, eventually breakfasting with her grandparents. The banality of the situation is subverted by a ratcheting sense of dread, however, as we discover that Jessica's increasingly nightmarish house is filled with creatures around every corner: some whimsical, some sexual, some despairing and some malevolent. Jessica Farmis an ambitious experiment in world-building: as conceived by Simmons, this book is the first volume of a life-spanning comics project in which he drew one page every month for the past seven years, starting in January 2000 — and will continue this project for 50 years in total, making up the story as he goes and releasing 96-page increments every 8 years until he amasses a 600-page body of work.</em></p>",

Spanning the globe from Spain to France and Germany, this book takes the reader on a tour of the everyday life of the spy. From the small lies and deceptions to the larger secrets that everyone hides, Super Spy reveals the nature of espionage and how an individual can be lost and also find redemption. A children's book is something more than it seems... a woman swims the English Channel to deliver a deadly secret... a German spy desperately seeks escape for herself and her daughter... and a spy continues to serve his country even beyond death.</em></p>",

This is a \"snapshot\" of Houdini's life, centering on one of his most famous jumps. As Houdini prepares for a death-defying leap into the icy Charles River in Boston, biographer Jason Lutes and artist Nick Bertozzi reveal Houdini's life and influence: from the anti-Semitism Houdini fought all his life, to the adulation of the American public; from his hounding by the press, to his loving relationship with his wife Bess; from his egoism to his insecurity; from his public persona -- to the secret behind his most amazing trick! And it's all in graphic form, so it's fresh, original, and unlike anything previously published about this most fascinating of American showmen.</em></p>",

Who are these people? We all know about the one who shot his hunting partner in the face, but how about the tavern owner who once married one of his slaves and then sold her at auction when she tried to leave him? Or the one whose President went to his death regretting that he hadn't had his Vice President hanged? Or the one who was too frequently inebriated to serve out the whole of his term? Over more than 200 years, the American voters have sent a platoon of rogues, cowards, drunks, featherweights, doddering geriatrics, bigots, and atrocious spellers to Washington D.C. to sit one bullet, cerebral hemorrhage, or case of pneumonia away from the highest office in the land. Veeps tells the sordid, head-scratching, perversely-entertaining stories of these men we've chosen to ride shotgun in the biggest rig in democracy, without ever seriously considering the possibility that they might have to take the wheel.</em></p>",

In this debut issue, see how Igor came under the employ of the inept Dr. Glickenstein, much to the loveable hunchbacked assistant's dismay. Then, laugh your way through Igor's first failed evil science fair experiment as he befriends the demented lab rabbit, Scamper. And finally, Carl Cristall, Malaria's top-rated TV talk show host, profiles another famous evil scientist on his program. This can only end in utter chaos.</em></p>",

Once the Christians have floated bodily into the sky, life goes on pretty much as usual for the immoral majority... except that magic works, if you're willing to risk demonic mutations. CNN reports that Mr. Christ and Mr. Bush are on a speaking tour of the red states. And an angelic army appears to have been deployed to mop up the sinners. But through it all, outsiders Raven and Mummy face the possibility of a bigger problem than the end of the world: the end of their relationship.</em></p><p><em>In the tradition of The Book of Revelations, Therefore Repent!, courtesy of novelist Jim Munroe (Flyboy Action Figure Comes With Gasmask) and acclaimed artist Salgood Sam (Sea of Red) is a lurid, dark fantasy tale. By taking the apocryphal scripture as literal truth — as the American powers-that-be claim to do — the story also explores the political and spiritual ramifications of God abandoning humanity.</em></p>",

The cast seemed to appear fully formed by the end of the 1990s, and ready for their \"close up.\" Every success story has its humble — or arrogant and mean-spirited — beginnings, and now Fantagraphics Books is tickled pink to present <strong>Mean</strong>, collecting Weissman's early, self-published, unpublished, and otherwise rare \"Yikes\" comics. Enjoy your favorite characters' awkward, embarrassing first appearances; watch them stumble from their early, crude glory into their mature sadistic and masochistic selves. Li'l Bloody and the Pullapart Boy steal candy, X-Ray Spence answers his fan mail, and Kid Medusa falls in love (twice!). Early critical attention, while overwhelmingly positive, often questioned what Weissman \"was on\" when he came up with these odd tales of young friendship. Read <strong>Mean</strong> and guess for yourself.</em></p>",

In book 1, Jimmy and Vanessa uncover the mystery behind a fall-out shelter in the backyard. In book 2, tragedy strikes both families, and the two kids struggle with understanding their fathers. The story marks the transitions we go through with how we perceive our parents -- first as idealized heroes, then as the enemy, and later in life, to see them for who they are.</em></p>",

Following the “A is for … ” format, Gaiman’s text takes the form of 13 tight, evocative rhyming couplets, hand-lettered by Grimly. Page turns divide each couplet, moving the action forward and building the sense of mystery. The illustrations do double duty, telling the children’s story and filling each letter’s page with suitably ghastly, nominal matter. There’s some disturbing stuff on display (the sewer walls are lined with children bound in chains, straitjackets, and rusty manacles), but the character of the pictures, spiky and knobby and childlike, and a palette of beiges, accented by muted pastels, mitigates the creepiness. In the end, Gaiman and Grimly have combined forces to produce an acrid, gothic confection that bubbles with vitriol and wit.</em></p>",

(also known in the East Coast underground music scene as Kites) is perhaps the most anticipated graphic novel debut of the year. Coming out of the fabled Providence, Rhode Island, art and noise scene, Powr Mastrs is an intense fantasy story projected to run to 10 volumes. In it, C.F. narrates the story of a tribe of mystical warriors whose power relations are constantly in flux. As power shifts, so do physical and psychological identities. In this first volume, we are introduced to the central characters and the complex geographies in which they wander. Overflowing with graphic ideas, from the intricately designed costumes each character wears to C.F.'s exacting architectural detail, Powr Mastrs is rendered in a distinctive pencil line that has already attracted much attention in sources like the groundbreaking comics anthology, Kramers Ergot.</em></p>",

According to Cleburne's proposal all African Americans who served the Confederacy as soldiers would receive their freedom upon enlistment. This was a revolutionary concept for its day and sent Cleburne's life spiraling down a perilous road. Set during the critical year of 1864, and culminating in the bloody Battle of Franklin, Cleburne is a tale of unbeatable courage in the face of racism, conspiracy and war.</p>",

This book is available in two horrific editions with all-new covers by Jacen Burrows - softcover or a special hardcover edition limited to just 750 copies.</em></p><h4>Release Dates</h4><ul><li>Softcover - 12/5/2007</li><li>Limited Edition Hardcover - 12/12/2007</li></ul>",

Wormwood is the anti-Christ, his dad is Satan, and his demonic powers help him fit right into New York. His best friend is Jesus, a black mentally-challenged man that just isn't performing many miracles these days. The pesky Armageddon is coming up, and it doesn't look like Pope Jacko is going to be any help in stopping it. Ennis drags the whole world into the gutter with his trademark razor-sharp dialogue, biting wit, and the stunning art of Jacen Burrows, all in full-color.</em></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The hardcover edition was limited to 750 copies.</p>",

Now, Byrne delivers the series 40 years after it would have debuted, recounting the adventures of interstellar agent Gary Seven and his Earth-born assistant as they covertly confront threats to the past so that they can save Star Trek's future.

Originally released in 1953, Get Lost delivered three groundbreaking, laugh-filled issues before Bill Gaines sued the magazine's distributor, shutting down production of the magazine. Even though Gaines lost the lawsuit, Andru and Esposito never produced more Get Lost. Hermes Press' historic reprint collects all three issues of the magazine on heavy coated matte paper together with an introductory essay by noted pop-culture historian Ron Goulart, an interview with Mike Esposito, and tons of documentary material in one volume. For this archival edition Hermes Press has painstakingly reconstructed Get Lost's artwork using the original black-and-white line art and recoloring it from scratch. Mike Esposito says it \"looks better than the original.\" MAD's most noteworthy competitor is a treasure to behold for fans of Alfred E. Newman as well as comic book collectors, fans, and anyone looking for a good laugh.</em></p>",

This is the world of New York City in the Roaring Twenties. Known for its sinister and treacherous underworld, there's a new power waking up the city that never sleeps. His name... John \"The Hand\" Smith. An outcast and an orphan, Smith has a massive right hand nearly twice as large as his left, and when push comes to shove, you'd pity anyone that gets in its way. When a rumble at the docks lands Smith on the local mob boss's payroll, it could be the break he's been waiting for. Along with his quick-witted best friend Bootsy and the martial arts femme fatale Ring-A-Ling, Smith and his crew are taking a big bite outta the Big Apple. But with the gangs wanting him dead and the boss's girl wanting him in her bed, has Smith bitten off more than he can chew?

            "description": "<p><em>This fourth installment in Michel Rabagliati's semi-autobiographical series finds Paul settling comfortably into adult life, occasional twinges of anxiety aside. His graphic design business has taken off, his partner Lucie is pregnant, it's mid-July and time to leave behind the city to go fishing. Long lazy days stretch out while Paul's thoughts wander from the colorful characters at the fish-and-game camp to the lurking depths of childhood, a Holden Caulfield-esque adolescence, and the encounters that have shaped his sense of family thus far. But the golden glow soon lifts off his vacation, with the realization that the lake isn't as idyllic as it would seem, and neither is pregnancy.</em></p><p><em>Elegant composition and spare, condensed drawing crystallize emotion and atmosphere in this wistful and engaging account of everyday hopes and hardships, told with a keen and playful sense of iconic detail. Even the mundane holds beauty and meaning in this compassionate story of expectation, disappointment and wonder.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>One of the true cornerstones of Western literature comes to the Marvel Illustrated line! The ancient world is embroiled in a mighty clash of armies: Greek vs. Trojan. Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, has betrayed her husband - the Greek, Menelaus - and fled to Troy with Trojan prince, Paris. The Greeks have sailed to Troy to bring her back - and crush all that stand in their way. This is the first chapter in the saga that virtually defines the word epic. It is a tale of gods and men, heroism and betrayal. From the lips of Homer to the pages of Marvel Illustrated.</em></p><p><em>Collecting MARVEL ILLUSTRATED: THE ILIAD #1-8.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The <strong>Star Wars</strong> saga continues! <strong>The Force Unleashed: Art of the Game</strong> chronicles the four-year development of the anxiously awaited, action-packed video game (releasing April 2008) developed by LucasArts from conception to completion. The book reveals innovative game design concept and images, three-dimensional renders, and behind-the-scenes photos. <strong>The Force Unleashed</strong> game casts players as Darth Vader's \"Secret Apprentice\" and promises to unveil new revelations about the <strong>Star Wars</strong> galaxy. The expansive story, created under direction from George Lucas, is set during the unexplored era between <strong>Star Wars</strong> Episode III: <strong>Revenge of the Sith</strong> and<strong> Star Wars</strong> Episode IV: <strong>A New Hope</strong>. The game re-imagines the scope and scale of the Force by taking full advantage of new technologies that will be seen and experienced for the first time, such as Digital Molecular Matter (DMM) by Pixelux Entertainment and euphoria by NaturalMotion Ltd., paired with the powerful Havok Physics (TM) system. These new technologies create gameplay only possible on the new generation of consiles. DMM incorporates the physical properties of objects in the environment so that every element reacts exactly as it should--wood breaks like wood, glass shatters like glass, Felucian plants bend in their unique way, and more. Meanwhile, as a revolutionary behavioral-simulation engine, euphoria enables interactive characters to move, act, and even think like actual human beings, adapting their behavior and resulting in a different response every single time. Well before its release, <strong>The Force Unleashed</strong> game is already buzzing on blogs and gamer websites, at gamer conferences, and among <strong>Star Wars</strong> fans. LucasArts is fully backing the promotion of the game to the tens of millions of <strong>Star Wars</strong> fans around the world.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>A graphic biography of the most iconic revolutionary figure of the twentieth century</em></p><p><em>Since his death in 1967, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara has become a universally known revolutionary icon and political figure whose image is among the most recognizable in the world. This dramatic and extensively researched book breathes new life into his story, portraying his struggle through the medium of the underground political comic — one of the most prominent countercultural art forms since the 1960s. Spain Rodriguez's powerful artwork illuminates Che's life and the experiences that shaped him, from his motorcycle journey through Latin America, his rise to prominence as a leader in Fidel Castro's revolutionary movement, his travels in Africa, his involvement in the insurgency that led to his death in Bolivia, and his extraordinary legacy.</em></p>",

Dual revelations rock the rag-tag fleet as a routine Viper patrol puts them on the edge of a bizarre scene - Cylon Raiders attacking one of their own Basestars! As the Cylon Basestar crashes into an ocean-covered world, Adama and Starbuck discover a bizarre creature that appears to be a Cylon Centurion engulfed by diseased flesh. The Cylons are sick and the apocalypse has begun! Grillo-Maruach is joined by Battlestar artist Carlos Rafael, along with colourist Carlos Lopez for this special comic book event, collected here for the first time! All four issues of the series are collected here along with a special cover gallery featuring the works of Jim Starlin, Michael Golden, Pat Lee, Carlos Rafael and Stephen Sadowski.</em></p>",

Caught up in the chaos are two lovers: the Master, a writer broken by criticisms of his novel about Pontius Pilate, and Margarita, for whom the Devil has his own plans.</em></p><p><em>Initially banned by the very bureaucracy it criticised, Bulgakov's satirical novel comes to life in this new adaptation. Mixing absurdity and erudition, it depicts fantastical events with a macabre humour, contrasting mischief and murder with humility and love.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>\"O beware, my Lord, of jealousy – it is the green-eyed monster…\" Iago's treacherous warning sets in train Othello's terrible descent into a hell of suspicion. Deceived by Iago into blindly believing his virtuous wife Desdemona unfaithful, darkness shrouds Othello's noble soul. And, as in all great thrillers, murder walks by night... In this fantastical manga version of Shakespeare's famous tragedy, the action begins amidst the carnival atmosphere of a re-imagined and otherworldly Venice. While masks may hide some characters' true motives, Othello's terrifying emotions are dramatically revealed. Othello is part of Manga Shakespeare, a series of graphic novel adaptations of William Shakespeare's plays. Drawing inspiration from trendsetting Japan and using Shakespeare's original texts, this series – adapted by Richard Appignanesi and illustrated by leading manga artists – brings to life the great Bard's words for students, Shakespeare enthusiasts and manga fans.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is probably the most original murder mystery ever written. It is also one of the first. Set in the oppressive summer of a St Petersburg heatwave, this is the story of Raskolnikov, an impoverished student who brutally murders a miserly old pawnbroker simply because he can. And so we enter the delirious mind and world of a killer – an intellectual misfit, alienated from his family and friends, cut off from a corrupt society \"as if with scissors\", and tormented by a \"Great Idea\" that turns into a cat-and-mouse nightmare with the police. Boldly and vividly updated by adaptor David Zane Mairowitz and artist Alain Korkos to a modern St Petersburg peopled by the grotesques of the 'Gas-Putin' generation, this upside-down whodunit traces the path of a man above suspicion who ends up informing on himself. But can he find redemption? When Robert Louis Stevenson finished reading Crime and Punishment, he said the experience was \"like having an illness\"; then he started writing a new story about a Scottish doctor called Jekyll…</em></p>",
