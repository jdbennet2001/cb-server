All the evidence points to the Hulk as the killer—but {CLASSIFIED}!</i></p><p><i>Join us for a brand--new story and a brand-new team who loves the Hulk as much as you do!</i></p><p>In Dimitri, Russia, Doc Samson and She-Hulk investigate the murder of the Abomination. Whoever got the drop on him was faster and stronger. They showed no mercy and gave him a severe beating. After the Abomination was down, the killer shot him several times with a gun.</p><p>Thunderbolt Ross asks since when has the Hulk used a gun. Maria Hill wonders how it is even possible that the Hulk did it. Iron Man points out that it's only a theory. Samson points out that with all the gamma radiation around, it doesn't seem like it could be anyone else. The giant footprints also point to the Hulk. Although the footprints have turned the ground to glass with all the radiation given off.</p><p>When Samson suggests they exhume the body to further investigate, they are interrupted by the new Winter Guard. Even though they were invited there by the Russian government, they don't care. S.H.I.E.L.D. was invited yet Samson, She-Hulk, and Ross are not agents.

Meet Peter Parker, “Midtown High’s only professional wallflower,” a hapless young nerd suddenly gifted with great power…no strings attached! Happy at home with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, but plagued by the bullies and mean girls of high school, see what Peter does when the bite of a radioactive spider gives him the strength to take the things he wants. Fame? Money? Fast cars? Girls? This dweeb’s up to his pencilneck in 'em! Surely things can’t suddenly be this easy… It’s a side of Spider-Man’s early life you’ve barely glimpsed, written by David Lapham (Stray Bullets TERROR, INC.) with art by Tony Harris (Ex Machina)! <br /></em> <br />Spider-Man stands in a wrestling ring, holding Crusher Hogan on his backside with one hand, the crowd cheering, looking on amazed. As the onlookers cheer, he thinks of how good his life is, so much better than what it used to be. </p> <p>Peter reflects back on how things were before. In the school halls, Flash Thompson gives Peter a wedgie that looks like it would sting for weeks. Lousy timing comes into play when Peter spots Liz Allen looking towards him. Despite the fact that Liz and Flash are dating everyone says they've been fighting. Peter thinks of asking her out, but he just doesn't have the nerve.  </p><p>At home, Uncle Ben tells Peter that he got him a car. Peter is thrilled until he lays eyes on his not-so-sweet ride. To say the car would need \"a little work\" would be an understatement. The kid already has enough problems at school, he can only imagine the horrors that will await him when he shows up driving a piece of junk.  </p><p>During a visit to a science exhibit, an experiment on radioactivity is being conducted. As the experiment begins, a spider slides down on a web between the path of radioactive rays. The spider bites Peter and it hurts unlike any other spider bite. He thinks of how he got sick and felt bad, and eventually got better. Man, did he get better.  </p><p>Not only did that spider bite transform Peter physically, but it transformed him mentally as well. With newfound confidence he runs along the lockers in the halls, taking Flash by surprise, who is so stunned, he can't even get a hit in, despite Peter taunting him with a freebie. Peter's excitement fades when he realizes that he's still stuck with a car no girl would probably caught sitting next to him in, dead or alive. A prize of $5,000 for anyone that can stay in the ring with Crush Hogan for three minutes could change all of that.  </p><p>Peter enters the wrestling contest, concealing his identity wearing a mask that looks pretty laughable. Even though he looks far from intimidating to Crusher Hogan, Peter easily wins the prize money. In awe at Peter's performance, Monty Caabash makes Peter an offer.  </p><p>Peter drives up to Liz's place, his car all fixed up. He things of knocking on the door to see if she'd like to take a drive but he starts having second thoughts. Peter's begins to feel a buzzing in his head when he's approached by Flash from behind. Flash asks Peter where he got his car. He tells him that he bought it but Flash doesn't believe him. Just then, Liz comes out and says that she didn't want to see Flash after what he did. Flash says that he came by with Peter. Before Flash can go on, Liz says hello to Peter. Peter is so surprised that she acknowledge him he can barely greet her back. Given new confidence, Peter challenges Flash to a race. Flash accepts the challenge.  </p><p>Flash takes the lead and Peter thinks of how he'll probably wind up killed for being so stupid. Peter feels the buzzing in his head just like he did before. He realizes that the buzzing in his head is a warning sign of just how far he can push himself. Peter floors it on the gas, making light of Flash before leaving him in the dust. There's a raccoon running across the street. Peter swerves at just the right moment and goes off to the side of the road, smashing up the right side of his car and damaging the windshield.  </p><p>When Peter comes home, Uncle Ben tries to console him but Peter acts upset to play things off. Even with his powers and new confidence, Peter still feels like a loser. He pulls out the EWO Extreme Wrestling card that Monty gave him and things of a way to change things.    </p>",

            "description": "<p><em>In 1987, Peter Parker followed Wolverine to Russia, who was on the trail of a friend working for the KGB. Realizing that the KGB would eventually kill his friend, Wolverine wanted to put her out of her misery. Peter tried to stop him, but accidentally killed the friend instead. Haunted by his actions, Peter fled home into the waiting arms of Mary Jane.</em></p><p><em>But WHAT IF…Peter never went home? WHAT IF…the Spider never came out of the cold?</em></p><p>A man by the name of Nebo is in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Nick Fury and the Black Widow stand before him. Fury is honored to be standing before this elusive man. He tells the Widow that Nebo trained an female operative named Alex. He makes killers. Nebo denies ever seeing her. Fury quickly points out that he already knows. Normally S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't concerned with his training since they usually end up in the C.I.A. That wasn't the case with Alex's sister, Charlemagne. She went on to work for the KGB. After she tired of that organization, she started killing them off. She hooked up with Wolverine and then Spider-Man got involved. Wolverine tried making Spider-Man go back home but Charlemagne tricked him into accidentally killing her, which is what she longed for. Spider-Man was messed up from causing her death. It's been a year and now Russian agents are dying again with claw marks and webbing left on their bodies. The story unfolds as to how Spider-Man was brought further into this world of espionage.</p><p>As Peter is about to board a plane back to New York, Logan shows him a picture of Alex. He figures helping her would be a way for Peter to redeem himself. The two of them set out to save Alex from some Russian agents. They soon find themselves faced with Fantasma and Crimson Dynamo. Spider-Man tries to stop Crimson Dynamo but his suit is too much. Finally Wolverine makes his way to his back and slices through the power cables of the suit. Not realizing that the suit is powered down, Spider-Man punches him and breaks his neck. Wolverine takes care of Fantasma with his claws. Spider-Man asks if everyone has to die. Wolverine says eventually yeah, but Alex doesn't have to right now.</p><p>After their escape, it seemed that Spider-Man figured if he could keep Alex alive, it would make up for everyone that had to die. He begins training with Nebo and soon expands the abilities of his spider-senses. Nebo learns that he can't even think of attacking Spider-Man without him realizing it. Peter and Alex started growing closer with all the time they spent together. Things didn't let up as the Russian operatives still wanted her dead.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to track money being sent back to Peter's Aunt. Nick asks where the rest of the money they made went. Nebo tells them that with Spider-Man and Wolverine's influence, a lot went to charities and some went to help mutants. The three of them began a mission of doing \"good.\" Nick still doesn't see how all this has escalated the return of the Cold War. It turns out Spider-Man was tired of being on the defensive when it came to Alex's safety.</p><p>Fury tells Nebo he's lucky they grabbed him when they did. The next mission they were to go on has been revealed to be an ambush against them by the old Soviets. Inside a shack, Alex isn't finding much information from the computers there. Wolverine wonders where Nebo is. Spider-Man says he'll show up later. Wolverine starts getting anxious and Spider-Man asks them to get on the floor for a second. The place is under attack. Wolverine asks how they were able to get a drop on them without it tipping off Spider-Man's senses. Spider-Man now stands before a dude with two blades. Webbing is useless as he can easily slice them. Spider-Man surprises him by revealing a gun built into his web-shooters.</p><p>The fun's not over as they sense they are surrounded by snipers. Spider-Man tells the two of them to just stay alive for one more minute. Then a helicarrier arrives. S.H.I.E.L.D. orders the Russians to drop their weapons. A man tells Fury that this doesn't concern them. He tells Fury that they just want Alex dead for state security. Fury offers him something better and reveals that the man with them is the Rook. They decide to hand over Nebo to stop the Cold War. Fury says only if they let the three go. Wolverine is impressed that Peter set this all up. As Nebo is being taken away, he has one thing to say to Peter, he has now become his greatest student.</p><p>Fury decides to let them go too. He says he may even be stupid enough to hire them at some point in the future. Spider-Man hands a old beaten letter to MJ. He says it's too dangerous for him to even put an address on it. It turns out the letter is a goodbye to his old life.</p>",

But after the shocking events of “Messiah Complex,” Cyclops realizes that some enemies need to be dealt with permanently… and the X-Men can never know about it. Enter WOLVERINE, WARPATH, X-23 and WOLFSBANE…X-FORCE.</p><p>At Angel's Colorado Rocky Mountain retreat, Wolverine is visited by Cyclops and Wolfsbane. Cyclops tells him that seventeen hours ago, the leader of the Purifiers, Reverend Matthew Risman, turned himself in to S.H.I.E.L.D. It turns out the Purifiers had a mole inside and they ended up killing sixteen S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. This is the first time they killed humans. The plan was to steal something deadly that could be used against mutants. Cyclops wants Wolverine to re-form X-Force and put a stop to them, permanently. He's tired of sitting back watching mutants die on their doorstep. When Wolverine says he's impressed and asks what Emma thinks about this, Scott replies that she doesn't know about it.</p><p>At Camp Verde, Warpath is preparing a burial for Caliban. He regrets that he died trying to save him. He swears a blood oath that the Purifiers will die for this.</p><p>Wolverine tells Scott that Warpath may be able to make the decision to be on X-Force but Laura doesn't. His whole reason to bring her to Xavier's was so she could learn to be a person. Scott tells him he already asked her. At that exact moment, X-23 is inside the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility checking out the scene. She sees the surveillance footage and gets Risman's scent. She radio's Cyclop and asks what her next move is. Wolverine decks Scott saying she's his responsibility and he should have asked him first. He also says that Rahne can't be in this either. Rahne insists that she needs answers.</p><p>The Purifiers are tracked to the North Dakota Church of William Stryker. Inside they have the body or Nimrod and Bastion. They join the body of Nimrod with the head of Bastion. When it is activated, it immediately detects mutants. Wolverine, X-23, and Warpath are outside.</p><p>It's a slash-fest inside. They soon discover that Risman has Rahne held captive. He tells them to stand down as he holds a gun to her head. Laura says he's bluffing. Before Wolverine can stop her, she makes a move. Seconds later, a gunshot is heard...</p>",

(WORLD WAR HULK) reunite for the best new book of the 21st century. Have you ever wanted to be a super hero? Dreamed of donning a mask and just heading outside to some kick-ass? Well, this is the book for you--the comic that starts where other super hero books draw the line. KICK-ASS is realistic super heroes taken to the next level. Miss out and you're an idiot!</em></p><p>Dave Lizewski lead a typical high school life. He wasn't popular or a geek or class clown. He was just another average student at his high school. He couldn't even strike up a conversation with the girl he liked. His mother died of an aneurysm when he was fourteen and he lived with his dad, who was still having problems coping with her death.</p><p>As an escape, Dave played a lot of video games and was really into comic books. He became so obsessed with comics that he decided that was the career he wanted for himself, even though superheroes didn't really exist in the world.</p><p>One night he decided to put on a costume. He spent the first few weeks walking around on rooftops getting used to the costume and enjoying the thrill of wearing it underneath his clothes. He spent time working out and trying to come up with a name.</p><p>One day he decided to go into action. Seeing some kids spray painting a wall, he felt this was his time. Having courage from wearing a mask and costume, he approached and insulted the three kids. A fight began. Things didn't go so well as Dave ended up getting stabbed.</p><p>Dave struggled to walk home. Crossing the road, he ends up getting hit by a car. He was left with two broken legs and a crushed spine.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>It's never a dull day, being a Magician. The mad mind of Warren Ellis is once again unleashed on combat magician William Gravel, this time on a full-color, on-going monthly series! Magic. Everyone thought that he was dead, including the Minor Seven, the secret enclave of Britain's Occult Detectives. But Combat Magician William Gravel is very much alive and looking for the answers to how and why his place in the Minor Seven was filled by another and what the secret society is doing with the Sigsand Manuscript, an ancient supernatural text of unparalleled power. In a quiet, country cottage, Gravel will find the first clues to the Sigsand's location and in the darkness of the cottage's basement, a disturbing, unnatural thing that slithered into our dimension by the power of the ancient tome... Brought here from somewhere that mortal man could not possibly comprehend. The kind of magic that can strip the skin from a screaming man's skull, or direct the path of a shrieking bullet through a maze of city streets, striking its target between the eyes with pin-point accuracy. This is not just magic... This is Combat Magic, wielded by Sergeant Major William Gravel, Warren Ellis' cult-hit sensation from the pages of STRANGE KISS and STRANGE KILLINGS, now in his own, ongoing, full-color monthly series! This issue is available with a regular cover by Mike Wolfer, a wraparound by Raulo Caceres, a special Signed Poster edition package with a color poster of the #0 cover signed by artist Mike Wolfer, and also a rare 1-in-15 Black Magic Edition featuring a new cover by Wolfer.</i></p>",

Nina Locke answers the door to find Sam Lesser and Al Grubb, who are concealing a pistol and hatchet respectively. Taking a break from painting the house, Tyler contemplates the other places he would like to be, with Rod Fess in Baja or with his cousin Orin. Kinsey comes to take Tyler and Bode back to work. At the same time Rendell enters the house to find the two assailants.</p><p>The story comes to the present in San Francisco with Tyler Locke standing over an urn at a memorial service. After the service Tyler sits alone as Rod and Orin try to comfort him. His uncle Duncan sits beside him, and Tyler recalls a conversation that his parents had about the family going to Keyhouse if his father died.</p><p>The story returns to flashback as the Locke children near the house. Suddenly a gun shot sounds from within. Tyler peers in a window at Sam holding a pistol. As Al and Sam argue about someone hearing the gunfire, there is a noise outside. Tyler has fallen over and now has full bucket of paint on his foot. Sam goes outside to find a trail of white footsteps leading into the cellar, he does not notice Kinsey and Bode cowering on the roof behind the chimney.</p><p>The story returns to the present with the Lockes entering Lovecraft, Massachusetts. The family finally arrives at Keyhouse.</p><p>Returning to the flashback, Sam follows the trail to find Tyler's shoe, as Tyler stands behind him, brick in hand. Sam turns and shoots, Tyler lunges and tackles Sam as he fires three more shots. With his back to the wall Tyler strikes Sam in the face with the brick. Sam fires again as Tyler hurls the brick into his face. Tyler takes Sam to the ground, knocks the gun away, and beats Sam unconscious with a brick. Gun in hand, Tyler enters the house by climbing a ladder from the cellar. Al is there to meet him and kicks Rendell's body into the cellar. Tyler tries to shoot Al, but there no more bullets. As Al comments on finding his hatchet, Nina uses it to strike him in the head, killing him.</p><p>In the present as Bode tries to retrieve a sword from the wall he notices something lying on the framing above a door. Bode knocks the object down to find that it is a key, and proceeds to use it on the door.</p><p>We now find that Sam is imprisoned. In his cell he talks to his sink of how he was promised a new home, a new face. Suddenly a face appears in the water and says that he has both and that soon he will be released from this place.</p><p>The story returns to Bode opening the door. As he steps through his body falls to the ground and a ghost of him continues forward. Looking down he realizes this and rushes back through the door. His dead body reanimates and he slams the door shut.</p>",

It’s a hard-hitting period-piece, set in the grimy early 70s, where crime, seduction and betrayal go hand-in-hand. And on top of this longer-than-usual length main story, CRIMINAL now features an expanded back-pages section, as well – with articles by Brubaker and other top crime writers, from novelists to screenwriters to comic writers. These noir articles have become a popular piece of the CRIMINAL package, and are something that can only be found in the comics, not in any collections. So please take this SECOND CHANCE IN HELL to find out what everyone’s been talking about!</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>It’s the return of the best-selling comic book series, inspired by Stephen King’s epic The Dark Tower! Gunslinger Roland Deschain has seen the death of his lover Susan Delgado. And the Big Coffin Hunters who burned her at the stake are now in pursuit of Roland and his ka-tet Cuthbert and Alain. The friends are forced to flee into the desert with the deadly posse in hot pursuit….and Roland is in a coma! Don’t miss this opening chapter starring the Gunslinger whose quest for the Dark Tower will shake the foundation of reality itself!</p><p>After battling in Eyebolt Canyon, in The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born, the young trio of Gunslingers must flee with haste and return home to Gilead.</p><p>However, before leaving, Roland stops in town to collect the remains of his fallen lover, Susan Delgado, from atop the Reap Night Bonfire. Suddenly, Roland yells, “It’s all your fault,” and shoots. Cuthbert, believing that Roland is shooting at Alain, tackles Roland to the ground but Alain recognizes Roland’s true target, the sphere known as Maerlyn’s Grapefruit; or rather, whoever may have been watching through it.</p><p>Unlacing the bag that contained the sphere, Alain peered in to survey the damage caused by Roland’s well-placed bullet.</p><p>To his bewilderment, the fragments of the shattered sphere had begun to re-form into an eyeball shaped creature. Alive and growing, the creature lashed out and attached itself to Roland’s face. Cuthbert and Alain struggled and finally removed it, the creature returning to its original form, but it was too late, Roland’s mind was already trapped inside Maerlyn’s Grapefruit. Alain tries to use his touch to release Roland but the spheres grasp is strong and trouble, in the form of the Hambry posse, is closing in fast. Picking up Roland’s body, the two Gunslingers run to their horses.</p><p>Gaining some distance by killing Clay Reynolds’ horse, Cuthbert and Alain move off onto a rocky path and follow it to a river. Cuthbert, in a prideful moment and against Alain’s warnings, jumps into the river in an attempt to ford it and is swept away in its strong current. Screaming for help and rushing towards a waterfall, Cuthbert is able to catch hold of a strong branch held out to him by Alain.</p><p>Meanwhile, unbeknownst to anyone, as the posse from Hambry follows the trio of Gunslingers, Sheemie follows the posse. However, being half-witted and troubled with guilt, Sheemie looses the posse’s trail and finds himself at an old run-down building with the sign, “Welcome to the Dogan,” across a fence. Unaware of the impending danger, Sheemie ducks under the fence, crosses to the building and climbs down its latter. Upon reaching the bottom, Sheemie finds a mummified corpse and, what with not being too bright, he spends the next twenty minutes trying to talk to it. Involved in his task at hand, Sheemie never even saw the robot in the corner until it was too late. “Sheemie wants to scream. But you know how sometimes you’re so damned scared that your throat closes up and no matter how much you want to, you can’t make a sound except a terrified squeak? It’s just like that.”</p><p>Additional Content: Welcome To The Dogan, Part I: The Ghostly Queen.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Cable is back with Baby on Board.</p><p>A new ongoing series spinning out of the decade’s biggest X-Men event! The future of mutantkind starts here!</p><p>“Messiah CompleX” changed the X-Men forever. But no one’s world has been rocked as hard as Cable, the time-traveling mutant from the future. He’s been charged with the one mission that could save all of mutantkind -- or, if he fails, Spin it swirling into extinction. And hot on his trail is a relentless enemy who won’t stop until blood is spilled. No matter where…or when…Cable runs. Brought to you by the dynamic team of Duane Swierczysnki (MOON KNIGHT ANNUAL) and Ariel Olivetti (PUNISHER WAR JOURNAL).</p><p>Don't miss \"Cable # 1\"</p><p>In New Jersey in the year 2043 A.D. Cable stands facing the New York City. He comes across a masked man carrying a gun asking for a toll. He tells him that nothing is free in Jersey. As he makes conversation, he notices two other armed men nearby watching them. He gathers by the amount of weaponry they have that they must be amateurs. He offers his knife as payment, The real intention was to be a distraction. He takes out the first man and tries using him as a shield but gets clipped by a sniper. He takes him out and the third man. He notes that things were too close and checks on the baby he's carrying on his chest. She looks up at him and is doing fine, except she needs a diaper change.</p><p>Cable and the baby have been traveling for five months. They've made their way from Scotland to here. He thinks how the baby cries a lot now and how she didn't so much in the beginning. He thinks back to when he liberated her from the hospital and fought against everyone to \"save\" her. He knows the baby will be the one to save them all someday. Until that day comes, he has vowed to watch over her.</p><p>The two of them go out to find something to eat. He covers her up as he approaches an old diner. Inside, someone is wearing a watch with an X symbol on it. The person thinks that the time is approaching and he won't hesitate this time. He pulls out a gun and aims it at the door just as Cable walks in. Cable sees the gun too late. He turns to protect the baby and gets hit. The shot sends him flying through the window. As he lies on the ground, the man that shot him is announces to everyone that his name is Lucas Bishop and he is a cop. Looks like he got himself a new metallic arm, just like Cable.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Writer/creator Wayne Osborne and artist John Byrne present FX, an all-new, six-part series introducing a new hero for the ages. Struck down by a mysterious accident, Tom Talbot awakens to find that playing pretend has suddenly become all too real. He now has power limited only by his imagination-but will it be enough to stop the savage Silverback? Comic legend Byrne provides a cover and pencils and inks for the entire series.</i></p><p>Tom and Jack are best friends playing in the park. They have sticks and are pretending to be knights. Jack gets away and hides in a tree. As Tom searches for him a bright light appears and zaps him. Momentarily stunned, Tom is unable to dodge a blow by Jack and is hit in the head. He gets knocked out.</p><p>At the hospital, the doctor talks to Tom's parents. He says he should be fine and isn't sure why he hasn't woken up yet. Mr. Talbot is yelling unreasonably and his wife convinces him they should go down to the cafeteria for a bit. As they leave, Jack asks if he can see Tom. After a scolding by Mr. Talbot, he goes in and sits next to Tom. He talks to him and finally Tom wakes up.</p><p>A few days later, the boys are outside the apartment despite Talbot's \"orders\" that he stay in bed. They begin playing and talk about blasting any bad guys that might come upon them. Tom pretends to have a bazooka and suddenly a yellow constructed one appears on his shoulder. He accidentally blows up a garbage dumpster. The boys take off to hide in the park.</p><p>Not knowing what's going on, Tom decides to try something else. He holds out his hand and pretends to have a blaster. Saying \"ZZZT\" he shoots a tree down. Jack insists Tom is a superhero now and tells him to try something bigger. Tom thinks then imagines a rocket. He takes off but becomes shocked and loses his concentration. Tom begins falling but conjures up an aircraft at the last moment. After he catches his breath, he tries several more types of vehicles.</p><p>The next day, Tom shows Jack the costume he made. He wears a hooded sweatshirt with iron-on letters \"F X,\" a mask, gloves and camouflage pants. He sticks them in his book bag.</p><p>At school, Tom runs into the girl he has a crush on, Raye. He asks if he can borrow her English notes since he's missed some school. Ace, the school bully, shoves Tom into a wall for \"playing out of [his] league.\" Angry, Tom manages to momentarily restrain himself until they walk away. He thinks up a bowling ball and knocks Ace down. Raye yells at Ace and asks if he simply can't walk and talk at the same time. She tells him she wonders why she's going out with him at times.</p><p>On a field trip to the zoo, the boys head over to get a look at Silverback. An announcement goes over the speakers asking all patrons to not make sudden movements or loud noises. Silverback, a huge gorilla, is being transported. He is chained and cuffed and followed by several armored guards. As they prepare to move him into the back of an armored truck, he breaks free. The boys are thrilled by this.</p><p>Dressed as FX, Tom gets Silverback's attention by jumping on him in the shape of a big lion. Thinking he needs to be careful not to hurt Silverback, Tom finds this won't be as easy as he thought. Silverback yells out \"Free!\" and plows through the guards. One notes that their tranqs aren't working and he feels that they were set up.</p><p>Jack checks on FX as Raye comes up and asks if he knows him. Jack plays off not knowing him when Silverback grabs the \"pretty\" and walks away. FX flies after him. He makes machine guns to take him out. Tom now finds himself falling again. He apparently can only create one item at a time.</p><p>Having Silverback's attention, FX is now in his sites. He says he's going to hurt him since he was hurt. Taking a beating and begging Silverback to stop, he tries one last thing. He pictures a cybernetic-type arm and delivers a forceful blow that knocks out Silverback.</p><p>That evening the news reports the heroic deed of a new Super Hero named FX. A package arrives for Tom. He opens it to find a new professional looking costume. Jack remarks that now he can get rid of his cheap-o one. Tom is more concerned by the fact that this means someone knows about him. Jack finds a card with an address. Tom says he'll check it out later. Putting the costume on, he takes off flying over the city.</p><p>Elsewhere, FX is being watched by a mysterious hooded figure with a skull face...</p>",

His grandfather's house is part of his inheritance, and he plans to sell it as soon as he can. Even though the locals think the house is haunted--something Gus immediately dismisses--a slick man named Mr. Snide promptly appears with his \"associates\" and makes an offer. But when Gus declines to sign over the house right then and there, Snide reveals that his arrangement with the mayor will seal the deal soon enough!</p><p>Left to explore the place, Gus experiences a series of very odd events. How did his folded clothes end up in knots? Who on earth would drill a hole in a coffee cup? Certainly not ghosts, but for a former fighter pilot's abandoned old home, it sure is clean . . .</p><p>When the house's tiny residents decide to take extreme measures, Gus will meet the gremlins up close and personal-just like his grandfather, who first discovered them sixty years ago!</p>",

Before he was recruited into StormWatch, Jack Hawksmoor was a solitary urban hero, misanthropic and alone. While preventing a massive robot attack on the Golden Gate Bridge, Hawksmoor gets unexpected assistance from a woman he has more in common with than he realizes, then later stumbles upon a locked-room murder mystery. On top of all this, his city-born powers have been acting up — and he has a gumshoe's suspicion that all this may be connected.</p><p>In the city Kiev located in the Ukraine a Slavic god is attacking the capital city. Jack Hawksmoor noticed it before even the Carrier picked it up and now the whole of The Authority has come to deal with it. The team approaches it and can hear it talking but The Engineer can’t translate what it’s saying. The Doctor then says that no one can because it comes from a time when language and culture were inextricably linked. Swift flies by and makes that comment that she can read the date on the quarter from two miles away but looking at the giant god is giving her a headache. Apollo notices that it seems to be shifting in and out of this plane of existence and Midnighter gripes that there will be nothing to hit. Just then the enormous deity raises his hand and something happens that sends half the city back into the eight century. Jenny Quarx is standing on a nearby building but is unable to help the team because the god seems to be affecting her physically just by being there. The Engineer sees what the god did to the city and sends Jack to check for causalities.</p><p>Down below Jack sprints through the city and notes only a few injuries. He thinks to himself that he can feel every hear beat in three square miles but the loudest is the city’s itself and it’s racing. Jack finds a man half buried beneath fallen cinderblocks and asks the blocks to dissolve off the man. Nothing changes and Jack asks Kiev if it can hear him. When he gets no response he tells Jenny that the city isn’t responding to him and after he manually removes the cinder blocks he goes to see what happened to the part of the city that got taken away. As he runs he feels as if something is blocking the city from hearing him. He keeps going and when he steps onto the grass of the part of the city that’s in the past his brain is affected and he drops to the ground.</p><p>Up in the sky Apollo drops Midnighter so he can circle the god and superheat the moisture in the air which will hopefully break up the storm the thing seems to be connected to and hurt it somehow. He doesn’t get very far though because the god sees him and strikes him down with a lightning bolt. Back on the ground Jack is awake but crippled from the waist down. He tries to tell a building in the city to catch Apollo but it doesn’t respond and when the solar powered superhero crashes debris flies everywhere. Jack tries to protect some civilians and as everything fades to black he remembers the last time a city didn’t listen to him.</p><p>It’s 1994 in California and Jack Hawksmoor is leaping over to a giant robot that looks like it’s attacking the Golden Gate Bridge. In midair Jack smells what the thing is made of, normal metals and something more exotic. He bounds from the bridge and increases his density hoping to hit the robot with enough force to damage it or knock it over but instead he just ricochets off towards the bridge again and crashes onto the hood of a woman’s car. Jack gets up and has a brief word with the woman. The sight of her seems to stumble him and her perfume makes his head go light. Once he gathers his wits he jumps on a cable on the bridge and reassess the situation. He now knows that he’s not hard enough to hurt the robot so he looks for something he can. He calls to the ruins of the quake of 1906 that are at the bottom of the bay and has them form a fist. Before he can use it to smash the robot though, the thing spins around and blasts away the fist. Then it turns its guns on Jack and fires. Jack jumps out of the way and onto the robots gun arm but the cables he was holding onto are shot in half. When Jack lands on the robot he feels the heat from the gun and it burns away parts of the legs of his favorite suit just by being near it. He changes tactics and has the ruins in the bay spin to cause a giant wave. Before the wave hits he tells everyone on the bridge to get into their cars and moments later the wave knocks the robot into the bridge and fills it with seawater. Jack jumps back onto the robot and starts punching his way into it to find its pilot. Inside the robot is what appears to be a blue man in an old English outfit. The pilot doesn’t surrender so Jack rips off one of its enormous shoulder guns and threatens him some more. At that moment the strain of having caught the robot and taking the huge wave causes the base of the bridge to crack. Jack orders it to increase its density, fix itself and not break again. Jack sees more damage though and realizes that he needs to end things quickly so he can give the bridge more attention. He calls the ruins once again and has them hold the robot’s legs and then tells one of the bridge’s cables to snap. When the cable breaks it whips out and cuts off the robot’s head. The rest of the machine sags but doesn’t fall and Jack starts ripping into it. From another point on the robot that Jack can’t see, the pilot escapes onto the bridge and makes a run for it. It seems like he’ll escape when from out of nowhere the girl whose car Jack landed on appears and decks the pilot. Jack drops down onto the bridge and asks her where she learned to throw a punch like that. She says she does Tae Bo but Jack is looking her over again and feels like there’s something off about her. He asks her if she’s completely human and she says no. Jack turns to the bridge for some quick repairs and she tells him that she tried out for Stormwatch but got cut in the second round. Jack hears the police coming and prepares to leave. As he jumps away she tells him her name is Juliet and he apologizes about her car. Jack thinks to himself that Juliet will be trouble so he decides to forget all about her.</p><p>Later that night Jack is flipping through the city and thinking to himself. He never sleeps but there’s a part of his brain that’s never really awake, it just resonates in a frequency above consciousness. It’s the closest he comes to dreaming and that’s where the city speaks to him. He keeps moving through the city and thinks more about his abilities. He can smell every dog park in the city, radio transmissions crawl into his head from all over America, he knows the dates on the newspapers burning in the trash, he lives on pollution and his heart has been replaced with a magnet for trouble. Right then he feels a pull and goes to check it out. Two older teens have cornered a young girl and when one pulls a knife Jack drops the ladder of an apartment’s emergency stairs on his head. He grabs the other one by the collar and drags him up on the roof. He’s about to tie him to something when he gets another alert. Instead he threatens the thug and throws him off the building, purposely breaking his leg.</p><p>Jack skips over to Pacific Heights and goes to house where he knows something bad just happened even though the city won’t tell him what. Jack smells something burnt but knows it wasn’t a gun. He finds he body of a man in the kitchen and can tell he died around an hour ago and he finds the source of the burn smell to be the hole in the man’s chest. Jack can’t feel anything else though. The rest of the place gives him static and the TV and windows won’t show him what happened. He can tell things about the house, but doesn’t know anything else about the murder. He finds a door that he doesn’t already know what lies behind it and goes inside. In the room he finds lots of blueprints for San Francisco going back to at least 1897. He says that looking at city blue prints always makes him feel like looking at a sister naked. It freaks him out. Suddenly he hears a key in the lock of the front door. The fact that he didn’t feel the person coming tells Jack that whoever it is, is being sheltered by the same informational black hole as the mans killer and so Jack thinks the person is probably connected to the murder. Jack hides behind the door and after the person calls inside for “Ben”, in walks Juliet.</p>",

The shape-shifting alien race known as the Skrulls has secretly infiltrated every super-powered organization on Earth with one goal...full-scale invasion! In this DOUBLE-SIZED first issue, page after page unveils reveal after reveal and shocking moment after shocking moment! Brian Bendis and Leinil Francis Yu leap off the pages of mega-hit New Avengers and deliver a story that will change the Marvel Universe forever. THE MARVEL UNIVERSE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!!!!!!!</i></p><p>Iron Man shows the dead Elektra Skrull to Mr. Fantastic and Hank Pym, saying that they are the smartest guys on the planet. He fills them in on what's been going on and even says that he can't even be sure if they are who they say they are.</p><p>On the Earth orbiting headquarters of S.W.O.R.D., Commander Dugan pays them a visit. While there, a red alert sounds off signaling the arrival of an alien spacecraft heading directly towards Earth. Agent Brand recognizes it as a Skrull ship. It crashes in the Savage Land. Brand calls Stark.</p><p>Back in Stark's lab, he tells Richards and Pym that this is a new type of Skrull, completely undetectable. They prepare to examine the body to discover how it could have been undetectable when he receives the call and leaves.</p><p>Iron Man tries assembling the Mighty Avengers. The only one there is Spider-Woman. He tells her about the crash and says to gather everyone to the quinjet on the roof. As Jarvis goes about his duties, Spider-Woman makes a call to Luke Cage. She tells him to get a head start to the Savage Land since she trusts him more than she trusts Stark. Luke asks the others if they're ready to piss off everyone. They are.</p><p>Arriving at the Avengers Tower rooftop, the Secret Avengers find the Black Widow there. Spider-Man webs her up while Ronin throws his nun-chucks at her, knocking her out. They proceed to steal the quinjet.</p><p>When Iron Man and the others arrive a few minutes later, Stark isn't too happy. They still cannot make a safe landing in the Savage Land as a huge dinosaur takes a bit out of the quinjet. On their way to the Skrull crashsite, they pass by the base they had their first battle. The place is a smoldering wreck. They don't bother checking what happened there since that's not what they came for.</p><p>They find the crashed Skrull ship. Wolverine can't smell anything since it's sealed shut. They debate whether or not to open it since it could either contain an army of Skrull soldiers or could contain prisoners with answers. Before they can do anything, the other Avengers arrive.</p><p>Luke says he's going to open it. Iron Man raises his hand but Luke tells him his suit can't hurt him. As soon as the door is pried open, Dugan says, \"He loves you...\" A bomb destroys the S.W.O.R.D. headquarters. Jarvis pulls out a disc and uploads an alien virus. The virus compromises Iron Man's suit. He falls to the ground seemingly in pain. The S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier has lost complete power and is falling towards the city. The virus spreads throughout all of Stark's facilities. The superhuman prison, the Raft loses complete power and the prisoners are free from their cells. The same happens at the Cube and Noh-Varr, a.k.a. Marvel Boy is free. At Thunderbolt Mountain Norman Osborn's computer starts to fizzle and an explosion knocks them all out. Songbird looks up and sees Captain Marvel arrive. At the Baxter Building, a Skrull posing as a tourist changes into Sue Storm and manages to gain access to the private elevator. She walks past Johnny, Franklin and Valeria and heads into Reed's lab. Compromising the portal to the Negative Zone, \"she\" simply says \"He loves you...\" as a big chunk of the Baxter Building is ripped into the Negative Zone.</p><p>Back in the Savage Land, the Mighty Avengers try tending to Tony Stark. He's having a seizure. They discuss what to do when their attention is drawn to the Skrull ship. Emerging from the ship is a band of Earth heroes including Spider-Man, Beast, Thor, Luke Cage, Jean Grey, Invisible Woman, Iron Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and others. The Wolverine from the ship says he knows who he is and asks who they (the Avengers) are supposed to be.</p><p>In Earth's orbit, Agent Brand tries calling the helicarrier. Their escape-globs only have about ten minutes left of oxygen. Not getting a response, she sees an armada of Skrull ships heading their way.</p><p>In Stark's lab, Reed thinks he has discovered how the Skrulls were able to go undetected. He's about to inform Pym, who holds an alien gun to him, saying he already knows how. He shoots Reed, transforms into a Skrull and says, \"He even loves you.\"</p>",

            "description": "<i>In the wake of Messiah CompleX, there are no X-Men and young mutants Rockslide, Blindfold and Dust are alone and directionless. Until the day Cyclops recruits them to hunt the new incarnation of the Brotherhood – and kill them. Joined by a pair of new recruits, the young X-Men learn a hard truth about the world post-Messiah CompleX: sometimes old allies make for deadly enemies.</i><br/><br/> <p>The story Begins with a dream with the Young X-men fighting Donald Pierce. Wolf Cub and Rockslide are just rambling on about not calling Wolf Cub by his name. Then they tell Dust to rip off his skin and she does. Now, his metal part of him is showing. Blindfold is walking to towards the battlefield with Greymalkin. Blindfold is worried and she says and I quote: \"I've seen this before. Pierce is going to kill--NO...\". We are now shown Pierce slashing someone with his metal claws and a Young X-men is dead. We are not shown which one it is though. Blindfold awakes in her aunt home (Which is shown to be in Prospect Plains, New jersey)and it is shown that it was her dream. We are now taken to Erfurt, Germany to meet the future Young X-men member, Wolf Cub.</p> <p>For some odd reason it seems Wolf Cub is acting more like Wolverine by Calling Maximus Lobo \"Bub\", who is now depowered thanks to M-day. Maximus asks Wolf Cub, \"What do you want from me......Mr. Gleason?\". Wolf Cub responds by saying \"Revenge\". Right when Wolf Cub is about to kill Maximus, Cyclops stops him. Cyclops says that if Wolf Cub wants to hurt someday, that he should come with Cyclops and he'll point him at the right target. Our next member is Dust. Who is protecting a city in Bakwa, Afghanistan from some normal bad guys. One of them challenges her and she shows him that she is not playing around by ripping off the skin from his hand. The people of the city cheer for her and some guy name Zabul (Who looks like a general) comes up to her and says thanks, but also asks her where she is heading. Dust isn't sure and this is where Cyclops comes in and says \"Westchester's lovely this time of year.\".</p> <p>Now, Blindfold is at the ruins of the mansion, but unknown to her, someone is watching her from a far. It seems to be Greymalkin. Next member is Ink and he is at LA Jolla, California. In a Tattoo store that is called, INK.INC. In the store he is getting a tattoo on his hand. While this happens, two officers come in and says that Ink (His name is Eric Gitter by the way) Heisted a Woman's car. They start saying the police motto when they are about to arrest him and he just continues on talking to the tattoo guy. They are finally finished and the tattoo on Ink hand is a Radiation symbol. He says that he wants to test it out and sticks his hand on the officer and the cop goes down puking. Ink is then arrested by the other cop. Now in jail, a cop comes toward Ink and unlocks the bars keeping him inside. The cop is then revealed to be Cyclops. The next member is Rockslide. But, Blindfold seemed to beat Cyclops to it and she is already there talking to him in a coffee restaurant. She tells him about the new team of X-men that he is going to be part of the new group. Cyclops come forth and says that he's been here for about 15 minutes and they hadn't noticed.</p> <p>Cyclops then says that he had hope Rockslide had a better sense of his surrounding. And then says: \"What if I was an enemy?\". Rockslide then says \"What if? I'm like indestructible, bro.\" Cyclops smiles and on the next page Rockslide is shown to be hit by an optic blast and he hit through the window. Cyclops says that he wants Rockslide to be on his team. Rockslide asks about Blindfold and Cyclops says \"Not part of the plan. I'm sorry Ms. Aldine.\" Rockslide then defends her and says: \"Her and me or no me, man.\" With all the Young X-men (Except Greymalkin)members at the danger cave, Cyclops explains how they are the last generation of mutants and who their new enemy is. The New Brother-Hood of Mutants. The leader is Lord Imperial(Sunspot) of the hellfire club. Cyclops actives a hologram projector and Cannonball, Magma, Moonstar and Lord Imperial are shown. Cyclops explains that his former teammates have joined him.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>A new team of Titans is born in the extra-sized first issue of a new ongoing monthly by Judd Winick (GREEN LANTERN, GREEN ARROW, OUTSIDERS), Ian Churchill and Norm Rapmund (SUPERGIRL, TEEN TITANS EAST SPECIAL)! Someone or something is continuing its attack on anyone who's ever been a Titan, including Nightwing, Starfire, Donna Troy, Beast Boy and Raven.</em></p><p><em>You won't want to miss this new startling chapter in Titans history that may forge a new team from the ashes of old, dead friends.</em></p><p>Leaping across the Gotham skyline during the day, Nightwing is on his way to one of the 12 safehouses Batman has peppered all across the city, musing that even though Gotham is a terrible city, he still loves it. As he begins to head to take a nap, his instincts kick in and he narrowly escapes being caught in an explosion. Dick manages to slow his fall using a batarang and grabbing a US flag and is still stunned and in disbelief that someone found out about the safehouses. He lands in an dark ally where he is surrounded by a variety of masked ninjas, no longer surprised.</p><p>At the home of the Animal Man in San Diego, Starfire flies around the backyard happily stark naked holding a towel towards the pool. She thinks about how nice the Bakers have been to her as of late but she still appreciates having the house alone to herself, able to go about her business naked, human prudishness still confusing her. She simply can't grasp why a culture preoccupied with sex are put off by nudity and assumes that it's only the United States that has this problem. She begins to sunbathe to rejuvenate her powers even further when Buddy Baker's son, Cliff, walks in from his soccer game. Kory is midly surprised that he is home early and promises to cover up when she takes notices that Cliff is freaking out about something behind her. After looking backward, Kory gets up to her knees and covers her chest, with a scream.</p><p>At James Madison High School, Raven is walking down the hallways with two girl classmates. Raven cynically and blatantly refuses to help them cheat on a test. When questioned, she gives them a list, insulting them both at the same time. They reach the stairs and the two girls who claim to be Raven's friends, tell her that everyone thinks she is a female dog. Raven admits that she is okay with that and again insults them. When one of the girls is going to tell Raven off, Raven senses another presence and turns to see a demonic fire-breathing warthog, telling the other girls to run.</p><p>In Washington, D.C. at along the National Mall, Red Arrow is riding to the Hall on his motorcycle and is called, yet again, by the nanny watching his daughter, Lian. Shocked upon learning what Lian did this time, Roy asks to talk to her on the phone. He begins to reprimands her for putting a waffle in the DVD player but is then almost speared when bony spikes erupt from the ground all around him randomly, obviously trying to do him harm.</p><p>In Prague, Czech Republic at the headquarters of the Doom Patrol, Beast Boy is woken up from his sleep and is very upset. As leader of the Doom Patrol, he gave the orders that they would let him sleep for one hour unless the mansion was on fire or Darkseid attacked the Earth. Talking on the phone with an unknown, Gar is about to vent but noticing lava raining down around him, looks up and yells an obscenity. He morphs into a flying squirrel to escape his room.</p><p>Seemingly in outer space but actually in the Multiverse, Donna Troy kindly explains to her partner, Kyle Rayner, in a force bubble that as much as she would like to go back to Earth they have to grin and bear it and get to the bottom of things. Kyle protests saying they volunteered to go the Multiverse, so theorhetically they can un-volunteer themselves or at least take a break. Kyle notices something is wrong and gasps, alerting Donna. Donna spins around to see a dimensional gateway open up with red little tendrils and tentacles trying to reel them in. Donna quietly admits that going home is a good idea which Kyle replies sarcastically as he struggles to resist.</p><p>In Keystone City in the home of The Flash, a tired Flash accepts his wife's invite for dinner and tells her to give him a minute to shower. Wally asks what's for dinner hoping that it's not pasta salad. He feels something odd touch his body and looks down to see some sort of red material crawl up his feet that eventually tries to cover his whole body.</p><p>Just outside Titans Tower in the San Francisco Bay, Robin organizes a training session some time after assisting the other heroes with the Sinestro Corps. and defeating their evil future counterparts. The others, especially Kid Devil and Ravager complain but Robin thinks that they need to learn some team maneuvers. He is cut off when a giant monster of Earth attacks them that makes Ravager's day.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in Gotham, Nightwing continues to fight the ninjas and despite some bleeding cuts on his face is winning. With the customary playful superhero banter, he asks them who they are and why are they doing this. He tries to throw a lady ninja by her head but only her mask comes off to reveal a demon with decaying eyes and tongue and incredibly sharp teeth. Nightwing slays her by throwing a sword through her head, literally adding insult to injury. The last ninja demon is taken out by Batman. Nightwing claims he could've taken him out but Batman admits that he is right but he was trying to save some time. He reveals that his teammates have been trying to reach him but they couldn't get in touch with him so they called Batman. Nightwing tells Batman that he doesn't have teammates anymore to which Batman replies that something has happened and the someone who is responsible thinks differently and that it's only begun.</p><p>Back on Titans Island in New York, Power Boy, badly burnt, is still hanging on a tree, speared through the chest. One of the former Teen Titans ask why is Power Boy is still on the tree to which another explains that they wanted to preserve the scene until they got there and the former Titan then announces that he needs to be off the tree and covered since they're here. Somebody asks about Vic who is put in a rejuvenation chamber, the lower half of his body gone, unconscious and stable. Hawk and Dove are stable too. Son of Vulcan, Lagoon Boy and Anima are comatose while Little Barda is critical. And Power Boy is dead.</p><p>The Titans except for Kyle gather around the crime scene where the slaughter of the new Titans East team was. Wally asks who did this. Dick asks him if he means who is trying to eliminate everyone who was a Teen Titan. Donna adds that it is someone with a really big reach, Kory adding vicious to Donna's statement. Gar comments that this someone has to be cunning too. He admits that he almost bought it, revealing that it was very real. Roy adds that it was supernatural since it couldn't been scientific or related to metahumans. Dick asks Raven if it is who he thinks it is. Raven replies with a yes and that Trigon has returned.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Carlos LaMuerto, a.k.a. Black Tarantula, is finally doing something good with his life. Well, at least it ain’t all bad. Lying low after getting out of prison and wiping out an entire gang, Carlos has become a low-key Robin Hood -- cleaning up the neighborhood he used to run as a gang lord. But he’s about to discover that leaving his past behind isn’t as simple as a change of attitude…as ghosts from his former life haunt him, Carlos turns to his friend/adversary, Matt Murdock.</em></p><p><em>Now Black Tarantula and Daredevil must work together to save the streets of Hell’s Kitchen from a powerful new gang from Carlos’ homeland.</em></p><p><em>SPOILERS</em></p><p>Alleged Recent Unregistered Activity:</p><p>• Daredevil crashed the Hood and Fear's meet and engaged Fear in an extremely violent conflict. Fear was easily bested physically, but there is no cure for Milla Donovan's conditionof madness inflicted by Fear. While Fear was locked away in Ryker's, Milla was committed to a long-term care facility in an effort to find some way to reverse the effects of Cranston's toxins.</p><p>• Carlos LaMuerto, a.k.a. the Black Tarantula, was once the latest supervillain/crime boss in a long line of supervillain/crime bosses. After run-ins with Spider-Man and Daredevil that eventually left him in prison, LaMuerto turned his life around and went to work for Dakota North (on a recommendation from Matt Murdock) after his release. It wasn't long before he took a more \"active\" role in crime-fighting, adopting his Black Tarantula persona again, only now as a vigilante.</p><p>Current Activity</p><p>• In a move reminiscent of Daredevil's now-legendary \"Kingpin\" incident, Black Tarantula has banned drugs in his neighborhood and takes the fight to some schoolyard dealers that leaves them in traction.</p><p>• The next morning, LaMuerto spots his estranged wife and son on a crowded street, but loses them amidst the chaos. Later that evening he gets a call from his son who is being held hostage. Walking into the obvious trap, LaMuerto finds himself at his odds with his own Argentinean gang from years ago, led by his cousin Luis.</p><p>• Luis has come to steal the Black Tarantula birthright and return it to \"greatness\" by once again flooding the streets with drugs and generally being a supervillain/crime boss. Before Luis can perform the necessary ritual, LaMuerto escapes his captors and flees to the doorstep of Matt Murdock.</p><p>• Three days later, Black Tarantula and Daredevil move on Luis's pier. LaMuerto finds his \"family\" only to discover they're actually innocents drugged and forced to pose as his family as bait. In the ensuing battle, Daredevil makes short work of most of Luis's goons, and LaMuerto (after surviving an explosion and severe burns) kills his cousin.</p><p>• Knowing there will be more men coming to steal his power and destroy his streets, LaMuerot strikes a deal with Daredevil. In exchange for the Devil's silence, LaMuerto will keep a low profile and wait for the other shoe to drop in this particular piece of madness in hopes of putting a stop to it once and for all.</p><p>A Regular Robin Hood—Though his methods are brutal, LaMuerto is indeed makes a profound impact on his community, and perhaps more importantly, finds peace within himself after a lifetime of misery and corruption.</p><p>The Family Business—At one time, the Black Tarantula was believed to be immortal. We know now that the mantle of Black Tarantula and its powers are a legacy passed down from father to son through ritual and sacrifice. Displeased with his cousin's decision to wash his hands of his criminal past, Luis LaMuerto has come to New York to restore honor to the mantle.</p><p>From the Ashes—After discovering that his \"family\" was not as it seemed, the Black Tarantula literally walks out of the fires of hell to extract vengeance upon his murderous cousin. One has to wonder if Daredevil sees the irony in this general situation.</p><p>A Deal with the Devil—Daredevil is typically known for a rigid adherence to the law, sometimes regardless of the consequences or situation. Here, however, faced with the very real threat of a secondary force set to bring chaos to the streets, he’s forced to strike a deal with LaMuerto, despite the fact that he just murdered a man. Desperate times and all that.</p>",

Well, if his name happens to be Tony Stark, it’s a situation that calls for some R &amp; R in the casinos of sin city! Mix in a beautiful archaeologist and the fifty-foot dragon statue she discovered, and a plague of lizards descending on Las Vegas, and it’s a recipe for the sort of armored adventure that’s a perfect chaser after an evening at the movies!</em></p><p>On the banks of the rising Yangtze, a man and woman are walking through some old ruins. The woman is there to observe an archeological find the man is showing her. As they enter a temple, the woman notes two statues of lions, called Shishi, are inside the temple instead of outside. The man suggests the Lions of Fo may have been meant to protect the outside world from the spirits within. He then tells the woman that a price has not yet been set on the object he is about to show her. They arrive in a massive cavern and in it is a massive golden dragon statue.</p><p>On an airplane somewhere over the Mediterranean, a woman is asking Tony Stark why he isn't flying in one of his own planes. When he tells her this is his plane, she says she meant one of his private planes. As he asks what her name is, a man stands up with a bomb strapped to his chest and commands that everyone stay seated. As he moves across the plane, Tony leaves his seat and goes into a bathroom stall. The bomber begins yelling at a woman holding a crying child, and Iron Man appears right behind him. He grabs the bomber and flys right out of the top of the plane. The suicide bomber blows himself up, killing only himself and leaving Iron Man's armor steaming. Iron Man gets back on to the airplane and trys to calm everyone down, but the passengers are angry at what he did and tell him to go back to America. As he leaves the plane, he comments to himself, \"I need a vacation.\"</p><p>In Las Vegas, Tony approaches to woman in bathing suits by the pool to accompany him to his suite. The giant golden dragon statue is being assembled outside of a new casino. As its head is attached to the rest of its body, nobody seems to notice it's eyes beginning to glow. Suddenly thousands of lizards from the surrounding desert begin rushing into Las Vegas.</p><p>In his suite, the two women are asking Stark if they can meet his bodyguard, Iron Man. The people of Las Vegas began freaking out as thousands of lizards swarm all over the city. Tony gets a call from Pepper Potts while in bed with the two women from the pool. When he comes down from his room, he sees what is going on in the streets.</p><p>A news reporter on the scene comments on city services being on high alert. A plague of reptiles has descended upon Las Vegas, and the mayor is urging people to remain calm. The reporter also notes that all hotels are at maximum capacity due to the grand opening of the strip's largest resort... the Golden Dragon Casino.</p>",

HOUSE OF MYSTERY focuses on five characters trapped in a supernatural bar, trying to solve the mystery of how and why they're imprisoned there. Each one has a terrible past they'd like to forget, and with no books, newspapers or TV allowed in the House, they face an eternity of boredom. But stories become the new currency, and fortunately, the House attracts only the finest storytellers.</i>  <i>In addition to the ongoing trials and struggles of the five unfortunate souls trapped within the HOUSE OF MYSTERY, illustrated by superstar artist Luca Rossi, each issue in the first storyline also includes a short tale, as told by one of the customers, written by Willingham and illustrated by a host of fine guest artists, including two-time Eisner Award nominee Ross Campbell (WATERBABY, Wet Moon), SANDMAN fan favorite and multiple Eisner winner Jill Thompson, and classic horror artist Bernie Wrightson, whose first published work was in House of Mystery #179. This series is topped off with ethereal, jaw-dropping covers from Sam Weber (The New Yorker, The New York Times, Time Magazine)and a stunning variant cover by Wrightson on the debut issue.</i><br /><br />While taking tea with his brother Abel, Cain's House of Mystery disappears from the Dreaming. Years later, Fig Keele is seen running from a mysterious pair of ethereal beings. She escapes into a bar: the ground floor of the House of Mystery, where food and drinks are purchased with stories. <br /><br /><h4>The Hollows</h4> <br />Hungry Sally's story of romance and betrothal, along with a \"difficult\" pregnancy that tore her apart.",

Can they find out what the Skrulls are after before it’s too late?</em></p><p><strong><em>SPOILERS</em></strong></p><p>A task force to combat the weird and wild across Great Britain was put together with the mutant Pete Wisdom as its leader. The fought angry fairies, giants, dragons, and army of Rippers (as in \"Jack The...\") and even H.G. Wells War of the Worlds martians...basically, sh— got crazy (go check out Captain Britain and MI 13 scribe Paul Cornell's Marvel Max Wisdom for the whole rundown. You won't be sorry, 'cause it was supremely awesome!).</p><p>And while all that is really handy to know, all you really need to know to begin this series is that one member of Wisdom's team is a known Skrull who's served in MI 13 for years, and usually shape-shifts to look like John Lennon...</p><p>Things are going just as poorly for the heroes on the other side of the pond as the Skrull John Lennon finds himself chained in an MI 13 holding cell. The Joint Intelligence Committee Chair comes down to see why he hasn't been executed, gets yelled at angrily by John about how he killed the other three Skrull Beatles.</p><p>The soldiers guarding John have received conflicting orders about killing the Skrull and when the Joint Chair steps up to pop a cap in his Skrully Beatle ass, Pete Wisdom makes his entrance...</p><p>After offing the bad Skrull and saving the good one, Wisdom informs John that the British forces aren't doing so well as the scene cuts to Captain Britain fighting a Champions-themed Super Skrull.</p><p>Cap lays the hurt down on the Skrull before the armada moves off and he's summoned to a meeting to discuss an operative against the Skrulls.</p><p>Below Captain Britain's sky battle, a young doctor named Faiza Hussain is yammering on and on about how she loves British superheroes (who doesn't, right?!) when a Skrull-piloted robot appears behind her ready to do some zapping. Luckily, she's rescued in a timely manner by none other than...</p><p>Saving accomplished, the Black Knight chats with Faiza. She gets a bit starstruck, he gets a bit flippant (hey, it's how he keeps the Ebony Blade in check!) before heading off to slice more Skrulls. Meanwhile, Captain Britain, Pete Wisdom and the Skrull John Lennon are being addressed by the Prime Minister who explains that all British superheroes now work for MI 13 (kinda like Bond works for MI 6, but these blokes have way more super powers so they work for MI 13). The group is discussing the Skrulls' movements when Captain Britain points out they're heading for the Siege Perilous: the gateway to Otherworld! To Avalon (Yes! That Avalon from Arthurian Legend!)! Where Cap first got his powers! Skrull John points out these extremist Skrulls are all about the wanting and Wisdom points out that what Britain has more of than anything else is magic...which is exactly what the Skrulls are after. The Prime Minister tells the three that they'll head off the Skrulls accompanied by another British hero because if the Skrulls get Avalon's magic, they could rule the world. The other hero, well, we'll let this spread speak for itself with her introduction...</p><p>On the way to intercept the Skrulls, Wisdom and Captain Britain are chatting about chain of command for their group, when Brian reveals his goal for a new direction in life...</p><p>Pete reveals he's been hearing voices about a hero he thinks are about Cap, and Cap's so glad to hear that one of their lot may be receiving visions that he's even more ready to follow Wisdom's lead—as the P.M. put him in charge of the group.</p><p>Back on the war torn streets, Faiza's aiding some inured civilians when a Skrull laser pops out of the ground. Black Knight dispatches quickly, but not quickly enough to save faiza who's been fried.</p><p>Back at the Seige Perilous, the MI 13 heroes arrive to a Skrull welcoming commitee and decide it's time to put a little English on it...</p><p>Skrulls dispatched, the group realizes that the green meanies didn't want to capture the magic, they want to destroy! Spitfire and Cap speed Wisdom and John to safety, before Cap heads back to intercept the Skrull missile, but doesn't look like he quite pulls it off...</p>",

Aware that some of the Earth's most advanced technology and weaponry is housed in the Baxter Building, the Skrulls have neutralized the building--by transporting it and its inhabitants straight to the Negative Zone! With one member of the Fantastic Four M.I.A. and another \"replaced,\" it's up to the remaining family members--not to mention Franklin and Val—to get back to our dimension, Skrulls or no Skrulls. But are any of our heroes who they think they are?</p><p>In Canada, Sue Richards is on a lecture tour. She calls home to check on how the kids are doing. Johnny says they're fine but Reed's disappeared somewhere with a look of determination. As she arrives in her hotel room, she surprisingly finds Reed waiting for her on her bed. He says he's there to be more romantic. Sue jokingly asks him who he is and what has he done with her husband. Reed then turns into a Skrull and grabs her with what appears to be invisible powers. The Skrull tells here that there is an invisible force-field pressing on her cerebellum. She struggles to ask where Reed is. The Skrull says he's already fallen as will the rest of her family and the world. She struggles against the Skrull and passes out.</p><p>Later at the Baxter Building, it seems that Sue has returned and walks past Johnny and the kids. A Skrull is impersonating Sue and is on a mission. The Skrull heads to Reed's lab in order to send Reed's technology away to the Negative Zone so that it can't be used against them.</p><p>Johnny tries to see what Sue's done while Ben grabs the kids. Johnny enters the lab just as the portal is swallowing everything in front of it. \"Sue\" looks at him as says, \"Forgive me, Johnny.\"</p><p>In the living room, Ben opens the curtains to find they are no longer in Manhattan but appear to be in the Negative Zone. Soon giant bug like creatures begin attack the glass, causing it to crack. Ben grabs the kids again just as they begin breaking through.</p><p>Johnny begins to regain consciousness and Sue is there by his side. Seeing her, he flames on immediately. She asks him to flame down and tells him they are in the middle of a Skrull invasion. She tells him that every team has been infiltrated. Reed sent her to secure the Baxter Building. He asks her why she was so sneaky about it. She tells him that they may have already been compromised and insinuates that Ben is an imposter.</p><p>Meanwhile Ben is in the kitchen and secures the kids in a cabinet. He tells Franklin to watch his sister. Closing the door, he tells them not to come out until he says so. Behind him is a swarm of the alien insects.</p><p>Johnny stands in front of his sister thinking over what she's saying. She asks him to say something. When he says he's thinking, she points out that that isn't his area of expertise. He asks her what her favorite movie is. Sue rolls her eyes but Johnny insists she answer. She answers wrong so Johnny flames on again. He asks her why she brought them there. She points out it was a trap and again mentions his lack of intelligence. Johnny starts thinking about the way she's been talking to him and saying his name. The Skrull reverts and reveals that she is...Lyja, Johnny's ex (that posed as Alicia waaaaay back and married him).</p>",

And what happened to the original team, Professor X, and Magneto after over 30 years of conflict, victories, and tragedies?

The winner of this poll was GeNext -- a story about who the children of the X-Men would’ve been, had the characters been aging in real time. Claremont’s health problems delayed the launch of the miniseries, but after two years the project has finally come out. Was it worth the wait?</p><p>Well, yes and no. The story itself is, so far, little more than the premise suggests -- a cast of second and third generation X-Men. If that doesn’t excite you, then you might as well put the book down immediately. If you’re the sort of person who read through the whole of “X-Men: The End” and loves “New Exiles”’ reliance on continuity minutiae, you’ll be well at home here. Everyone else, well, you’d better hope the novelty of seeing Colossus’ grandson is enough.</p><p>In fairness, it’s some of Claremont’s better recent work. With a fresh cast to introduce, Claremont actually turns in a cast of fairly engaging kids with immediately distinct personalities. Reading it, you’re transported back to the early days of the (original) “New Mutants”, and I say that in a positive way. There’s a training session, then a scrape in a bar where someone’s forced to use their powers, and there’s some soap opera inter-character drama. It’s a classic, old-school Claremont formula -- the problem is that there’s no suggestion of what the plot’s going to be when I pick up the next issue. We have scenes, but no story.</p><p>Drawing the series is Patrick Scherberger, a name I instantly recognize as being the winner of CBR’s very first Comic Book Idol competition. Nice to see he’s still around. His designs for the kids’ uniforms are really great, looking futuristic yet in a way that’s both fashionable and practical. He draws action in a nice expressive way that echoes a slightly more restrained Humberto Ramos. Some of the backgrounds are a little under-rendered -- only the few pages set in the club have any real detail, where the rest of the issue is pretty samey, but it’s not so jarring it ruins the issue, just a definite area for improvement.</p><p>I can definitely see this turning out to be a fairly entertaining little series, as long as you’re the kind of person the book is aimed at. The quality is such that if the level is maintained, I can see these characters being popular enough to warrant guest-starring in \"New Exiles\" before long, so anyone reading that title might want to take a look. Ultimately, the book’s biggest flaw is its central premise. If the idea of Chris Claremont writing a five issue \"What If: X-Men\" series makes you think it’s worth buying, then this is exactly what you want. If not, it’s unlikely to win you over.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The origin of fan-favorite X-Man Colossus is finally revealed, brought to you by Chris Yost (New X-Men, Messiah Complex) and Trevor Hairsine (X-Men: Deadly Genesis). Deep in the wastes of Siberia, young Piotr Rasputin discovers his mutant abilities -- and becomes the newest target of the ruthless KGB! Guest-starring Professor Xavier.</i></p><h2>Synopsis</h2><p>Our story opens with Piotr talking with his brother Mikhail, as Mikhail prepares to leave for the space program; Piotr doesn’t want him to go, but Mikhail insists that he’s doing it, not just for Russia, but for him to, to make a better world. He says that, whatever happens, he’ll always be watching over him: “Just look to the stars, and know that I am looking back.”</p><p>Three months later, as young Piotr treks home, he sees a military jeep parked in front of his house, and excitedly exclaims that his brother has returned; however, he finds some military officers presenting his crying parents with a medal. Piotr starts crying and runs away. One of the men sees him running and follows (the man is later identified as Alexander Vazhin, a friend of Mikhail’s, so we’ll go with that from the start).</p><p>Piotr runs into the snowy field, and then kneels, yelling that his brother was supposed to come back; he smashes the Earth with his fists, which have just turned metal, resulting in a huge impact that kicks up snow, earth, and stone, and shreds his clothes. Piotr weakly stares at his metal skin, and then passes out in the middle of the little green clearing he’s created. Alexander sees him.</p><p>Back at home, Ma and Pa Rasputin try to convince Piotr that his brother had a gift, and had to leave. Piotr gets angry, and transforms again.</p><p>In Moscow, at the headquarters of the Federal Security Service, Alexander (who works there, it seems) talks with his superiors and basically lies through his teeth about what happened with Piotr. However, his superiors aren’t buying it, and, after he leaves, they order surveillance on both Piotr and Alexander.</p><p>Alexander visits the F.S.S. archives, and pulls up a New York Times headline from May 5th, [year conveniently obscured], “Mutant Attack at Cape Citadel?” with a photo that’s a partial from X-Men #1’s cover.</p><p>One year later, Piotr holds his newborn baby sister Illyana in his arms and promises that he will watch over her, no matter what.</p><p>“Time passes”; little Illyana runs up to her brother at the farm and insists that he paint another picture of her (conceited little bitch); Mr. Dubenko, an FSS agent posing as a farmhand, watches all this from afar, and complains that he’s been hanging out on a Siberian farm for four years with nothing happening.</p><p>In Moscow, Alexander is at a bar, and answers a cell-phone call; the voice says they need to have a private conversation, and that Alex shouldn’t be alarmed. Alex looks around and finds himself sitting on a bar stool in an otherwise completely white space; Professor X wheels up, and says he believes Alex has been trying to contact him. Professor X explains that they’re on the astral plane; Alex says that Mikhail was his best friend, and they promised to look after each others’ families if anything happened to them. He knows what Piotr is, and believes that if the Russian government finds out their first inclination will be to make him into a weapon, when he’s really an artist and poet. Professor X says he’ll be in touch, and “by the way, they’ve thrown your body outside. The barkeep assumes you’ve passed out.” Alex wakes up lying in an alley against a dumpster.</p><p>Two years later, Dubenko is still pretending to be a farmhand, but catches a glimpse of Piotr transforming and lifting a tractor to please Illyana (“Piotr! Shiny! Come on!!”). He radios the FSS; Alex sees the transmission, and picks up his phone to call Xavier; suddenly, Professor X cuts in psychically and tells him not to be alarmed when three FSS agents appear and arrest him for treason, which they do.</p><p>At the farm, a bunch of commandos arrive to abduct Piotr; long (well-drawn) fight scene, he wins, including, impressively, leaping into the air and punching a helicopter to the ground. He finds one of the commandos is Dubenko, and Dubenko tells him that the Russians will never leave him or his family alone. Suddenly, Alex appears and shoots Dubenko with a tranq. Alex says that, as of tonight, the Russian government no longer has any interest in the Rasputin family, as, thanks the ‘patronage’ of an unseen “guardian angel”, no one will remember what happened tonight and Alex has been promoted to Director of Intelligence.</p><p>“Time passes”, and we get a redo of the Giant-Sized X-Men #1 scene where Piotr saves Illyana from a tractor. He looks up and sees Professor X and Alex standing nearby; Alex introduces the Prof, who explains that he needs Piotr to join his X-Men. Alex angrily says that the point of all this was to prevent Piotr from becoming a weapon; Professor X says that Piotr already is a weapon, “but I need him to become a hero”. Prof says that dark times are coming, and while the Russians won’t be coming for Colossus for the time being, others will, as mutants are power and will always be pursued; further, that Illyana may also be a mutant, and Prof wants Piotr to help him create a world “where she need not live in fear.”</p><p>Piotr has a chat with his dad, and Pa says that Mikhail knew the answer to the question, and so does Piotr: they belong to the world, and must do what they have to. Piotr, in metal form, looks in on his sleeping sister, and vows that he does this to make a better world for her, and that he will always be watching.</p><p>We cut to Westchester, where Professor X and Colossus (now in his familiar uniform; “In all my life I’ve never seen such clothing as this.”) enter the study, where Wolverine, Storm, Thunderbird, Banshee, Nightcrawler, and Sunfire are waiting “Welcome, Colossus...to the X-Men.”)</p>",

A senior at St. Joseph's Prep, he's smart, tall, handsome, and rich; a star both on the field and in the classroom. All the girls want to date him, all the guys want to be him. There's just one problem…Warren's changing. Something's happening to his body–humps have started to grow under his shoulder blades, and they're getting bigger and more painful every day. See the never-before-told origin of one of the X-Men’s five founding members, and his first encounter with an unsolvable, unrelenting evil…the Hunter. Written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (SENSATIONAL SPIDER-MAN), with groundbreaking art by Adam Pollina (X-FORCE), who returns with a vengeance to the X-Men!</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>With bloodsports banned in the UK, a group of overfed Brit Aristos have relocated to the Louisiana forests. Their aim? To pit themselves (aided only by a vast pack of slavering hounds and their own copious wealth) against a truly worthy foe: a single, terrified fox. Sadly for them, there’s more than one furry little critter in the woods tonight…Writer Simon Spurrier (GUTSVILLE, SILVER SURFER: IN THY NAME) and superstar artist Ben Oliver (ULTIMATE X-MEN, GHOST RIDER ANNUAL) present a brandy-swigging one-shot huntfest: 1-part ethical dilemma, 2-parts nationalistic cliché, 659 parts insane slice’n’dice-o-rama. Snikt! Also, includes a special back-up story written by Fear Agents' Rick Remender and Jerome Opena!</em></p><h4>Story 1</h4><ul><li><p>Louisiana, the woods: Hunting dogs and a hunter on a vehicle are in search for their prey. Wolverine hides in the shadows, claws drawn. A flashback to two days earlier, New Orleans: Logan gets into a bar fight. A young man offers him a ride and takes Logan to a camp out of town. Logan isn't happy to stay in this hippie commune, but he accepts their welcome. They want him to aid in fighting English hunters, enjoying the sport of killing innocent foxes. Logan refuses.</p></li><li><p>Present: Wolverine is tracked by the dogs, but foils them and shows he's smarter. The night before: Logan is sick of the hippies talking about the hunters. Their leader says he'll change his mind in the next morning. The aristocrats prepare for the game as the hippies play nice and offer them food. One of the hunters use Logan to get on his horse and another insults his nationality. He's ready to help the hippies.</p></li><li><p>Present: The dogs find Wolverine and it's a brutal fight. He manages to escape their grip. The hunter finds him too, but his shots are missed. Eight hours earlier: Wolverine explains he's not against hunting for a reason – survival and food for example – but the aristocrats have no good excuse for killing the foxes. He ambushes the hunters and ruins their game. One of them sees Logan and is fascinated.</p></li><li><p>Present: Wolverine attacks his hunter, but the latter shoots poison darts at him – and hits a soft spot. Seven hours earlier: The plan goes on and Logan wears a fox disguise, scaring the aristocrats. It's enough to make them leave Louisiana. The hippies celebrate and the guy who brought Logan in gives him a \"Moonshine drink\". Logan leaves the place and go to find drinks.</p></li><li><p>Present: Wolverine is dizzy due to the sedative the hunter shot at him. He finds himself back in the hippie camp. Two hours earlier: Logan sits in a diner and drinks. One of the aristocrats introduces himself and says that he was looking for a real hunt, a man who is really ready for a fight. He confesses that he did a research on Wolverine and planned everything, starting from the brawl in the bar and the hippie offering him a ride. The same hippie who gave marked him with the \"Moonshine.\"</p></li><li><p>Present: Wolverine pukes on the hippie who works for his hunter. The hunting dogs are in the camp too and they found the marked prey – the hippie. Ninety minutes ago: The aristocrat still tries to convince Logan to participate in the game, revealing his high-tech suit and hounds. When all fails, he threatens Logan with a tranquilizer gun.</p></li><li><p>Now: The dogs feast on the hippie as Wolverine sits on a tree and throws on them a Molotov bomb, burning the hounds. One hour ago: Logan is eventually convinced and agrees to play. He covers himself in the blood and smell of dead foxes left in the woods by the hunters, ready to play as the prey. Now: The hunter gets to the camp and finds his dead dogs. Wolverine jumps on him from above with drawn claws, ready for a fair fight.</p></li></ul><h4>Story 2</h4><ul><li><p>Bangkok, Thailand: Logan sits in the garden of a monastery, thinking about his dear ones who died because of the bad people he dealt with. He acknowledges his wrong side, the one that gets people killed. Now he tries to find a way to keep it caged.</p></li><li><p>A monk named Klahan thanks Logan for cleaning the place from drugs and prostitution, all without violence. Logan says that only violence will truly scare the criminals, but the monk accepts that no good can exist without evil.</p></li><li><p>A young woman runs after Logan and thanks him for what he did, but he gives credit to the monks. There is an immediate click between the two and the lady offers Logan a dinner at her place.</p></li><li><p>The woman, Dao, tells Logan that she was brought from Thailand and told she would work as a dancer, but made her a prostitute. She says no man would like to be with her after that, but Logan is not such a man. They kiss and go to bed, but Logan stops and says he can't do this because he is trying to become a better man. He leaves Dao's apartment.</p></li><li><p>Logan gets to the monastery as it rains. He senses that something bad happened: The criminals came back and massacred the monks. Klahan is the last one remained, barely alive and tortured by the villains. Logan is now ready to take care of them his way: Slashing and breaking bones. The last one was supposed to remain alive and take Logan to his boss, but his tattoo was enough to give him what he needed. Klahan dies in Logan's harms, disappointed that Logan gave in to his inner beast.</p></li><li><p>Dao is in her apartment, getting the news that her men were killed. Wolverine breaks into her house, representing Logan's dark side. He kills the crime boss and leaves the place with no remorse.</p></li></ul>",

I don't know. Marv gave himself up to the Skrulls and said he wanted to rejoin the Invasion. Then, next second, he is after the Thunderbolts. The only thing that links this is when Marv was watching the Thunderbolts on TV and saying they are an abomination.</li><li>Agent Brand floats in space, and recounts her first time on S.W.O.R.D. and dealing with Skrulls. Then she bumps into a Skrull batle ship and she looks like she can get into a vent. Pretty Meh</li><li>Wonder Man now is trapped with Beast from the Shuttle, and they discuss their past friendship and mistrust because of their situation. Then they separate. Pretty Muh.</li><li>Noh-Varr in The Cube has the Warden doped up on nanobots in Noh-Varr 's spittle, so Warden can report to Maria Hill. All the prisoners are getting a docile making wavelength from a program rescued from MB's ship computer until the Skrull virus breaks the wave transmission and it all goes to hell. A Skrull is the cause and MB destroys him while MB goes about forming his army. Interesting development.</li><li>The Agents of Atlas story is the most stunning. The Skrulls captured Namora and dehydrate her like Namor, but Gorilla Man and M-11 rescue her, take the Skrull General captive, and Marvel Boy, Bob Grayson, dissects him, and beheads him, in preparation for the counter attack of the humans. The General is commenting the whole time and eventually realizes these Agents are doing the self same thing the Skrulls were doing. I could just shout. But this is the only story not cross-referenced to another issue in Secret Invasion.</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p>(Tarnax VII, many months ago) <br/> In the far reaches of the Skrull Empire, plans are afoot. Chrell and Fremin are chatting. Fremin doesn't understand what they are doing there. Would the Empire really give these warlords the next Super-Skrull to resolve a border dispute? He is soft. Chrell replies that the child shows promise, and can be hardened. He asks him to come along as their guest has arrived. Fremin is surprised to find that the guest is Queen Veranke. She informs Commander Chrell that she has need of him. Fremin is surprised. He thinks this is insane. He cannot listen to her. He cannot <em>trust</em> her. Chrell, without a word, takes out his weapon and shoots Fremin dead. He informs Veranke that Fremin was a close friend and an excellent instructor, but he was not a believer. Queen Veranke then entrusts Chrell with two tasks for the glory ahead. She needs an army trained, and when the day comes, she needs the Prince eliminated. He is too dangerous to live. Chrell replies that when the day comes, he will end his blasphemous life himself.<br/><br/> </p><p>(Earth, present) <br/> It is a bright day and the runaways are in New York City, with Molly showing Klara the sites, such as the Empire State Building, the Baxter Building and a rooftop where they once beat up a guy. Times Square is only four blocks away. Xavin finds this unacceptable. Nico explains that it's called hiding in plain sight. It's only for a few hours so that Klara can say goodbye to her home. Then they will return to Los Angeles and drop off the radar. Chase stops at a hot dog vendor and Karolina is appalled. They brought Klara from the past to save her, not <em>poison</em> her. Chase asks what <em>she's</em> going to feed her. Tofurkey? That freaks him out and he's <em>from</em> this century. Klara talks to Molly. She feels that the clothes people wear seem awfully... sinful. Should Nico not cover her shoulders?</p> <p>Xavin is still complaining. She says that in the Skrull language, hiding in plain sight also means 'begging to get caught.' They shouldn't even have to be running. They shouldn't have to hide. \"Here it comes,\" sighs Victor. Xavin adds that New York City is where they <em>should</em> be. Is this city not home to Earth's superhumans? And yet, they are fugitives. They are treated like criminals when they should be the <em>rulers</em> of this world. Everyone, including Karolina, stops and looks at Xavin. She blushes and nervously admits that it sounded bad. What she meant was, they should be more like leaders, like the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. Karolina places a hand on her shoulder and figures she should quit while she's ahead. \"Or maybe stop thinking in general,\" adds Victor.</p> <p>Klara is looking skywards, and Molly reminds her that Chase said she shouldn't do that. She looks like a hick tourist. Klara keeps her eyes aimed high, replying that she is sorry, but she doesn't think she will ever become accustomed to the wonders of their world. Molly says sure she will. She wouldn't believe the things she has gotten used to, like vampires and giants. As she speaks, a shadow crosses them and Molly turns to look up. \"Whoa!\" she exclaims as she sees a Skrull invasion force approaching.</p> <p>Numerous Skrulls along with their equipment descend from the skies. \"It's raining Xavins,\" jokes Molly, not realizing the seriousness of the situation. \"Um, sweetie,\" says Karolina, as Xavin tries to figure out what's going on. The Skrulls land and Nico tells Xavin to snap out of it. What is this? she asks. Xavin's eyes glow and she turns to them before creating a flat forcefield which hurls them all away from danger, but which also knocks them out.</p> <p>(several blocks away) <br/> In Times Square, the Young Avengers swing bravely into action. The Vision, Speed, Wiccan, Hawkeye, Patriot and Hulkling charge towards Times Square with Eli calling the shots. He orders them to spread out and protect the civilians. Tommy reckons they're a little outgunned, but Eli says they will hold the invaders until help arrives. A Skrull picks up a New York Transit bus and Speed turns to the Vision. He thought the Skrulls couldn't do powers. He thought it was only the Super-Skrull guy and he only had the FF's bag of tricks. The Vision replies that it would appear they were wrong. Billy asks Teddy if this is about him. Have the Skrulls come back for him? Teddy has no idea. He doesn't know <em>what</em> to do. Watching from afar, a Skrull spots Hulkling and thinks it's a potential match. \"Inform the commander.\"</p> <p>(meanwhile) <br/> The runaways are slowly recovering from the concussive effects of Xavin's forcefield. Nico and Victor come round first and they see two Skrulls talking to Xavin. Unfortunately, they are speaking Skrullian so they have no idea what is being said. Victor needs a little more time to fully reboot. The others are still unconscious. He asks Nico if she has any ideas. Nico reckons she's already done a teleportation spell, but she's still got a spell that will stop Xavin's heart - assuming she's got one. She asks him to wait for her signal.</p> <p>Xavin shouts at the two new arrivals, and they decide to leave for the time being. Xavin then turns and sees her friends sprawled across the ground. She checks on Karolina who emits a groan, and uses her Invisible Woman powers to place each of her friends inside small capsules with which she can move them. Xavin looks extremely unhappy at what's going on. She takes the runaways over the stranded cars and away from danger, but, not realizing this, Nico casts a spell. \"Pop,\" she utters, and the capsules explode, dropping each of the runaways to the ground. As soon as Nico lands, she tells Victor to hit Xavin with everything he's got. He asks about the others, but Nico tells him that if they don't take Xavin down now, it won't matter. Xavin sees the kids fall and creates invisible cushions to protect them, but Victor takes the opportunity to use wreckage around them to wrap Xavin up in slithers of metal.</p> <p>Xavin insists that she was taking them to the Leapfrog. She's trying to <strong>save</strong> them. Nico asks what makes her believe her less. She attacking them, or her extended family playing 'space invaders' in Times Square. She asks Victor to squeeze, and the metal tightens around Xavin's Skrull body. She tells them that they have to trust her, but Victor replies that the team isn't big on trust. All she is, is another Skrull, just like the invaders. Xavin assures him that he's wrong. She isn't like them. The Skrull Empire has attempted invasions of Earth before. Her own parents did so, but this is different. These Skrulls are religious extremists. They believe in a prophecy that Earth belongs to them, and that their god has promised it to them. They think it is their by right. They will kill everyone that stands in their way... human or Skrull, she continues. They should forget everything she has said about standing up and fighting, and about her calling them cowards. They must get away. They have to <em>run</em>.</p> <p>Xavin adds that because these Skrulls see every human as a sin against their god, and they won't hesitate to kill them all, even the children like Molly and Klara. Nico turns and looks at her still-unconscious friends. \"This invasion...\" she begins. Xavin cuts her off. She informs Nico that if it has come to this, then the invasion is over. They have <em>won</em>. Now it's just a matter of cleaning up. She begs Nico, and asks her to remember her battle cry. Nico says, \"Try not to die,\" and quickly wises up. She asks Victor to grab everyone and get them outta there. She knows that Karolina will hate her for this, but Xavin tells her that at least she will be alive.</p> <p>(elsewhere) <br/> Hulkling thinks that, because he is half-Skrull, he can talk to them. He rushes over to a group of Skrulls and introduces himself to his 'brothers of the Empire' as Hulkling, the son of Princess Anelle. He tells them that they have to stop this. They all turn on him and blast him from all directions. Teddy screams in pain as he takes everything they've got. Nearby, Hawkeye think that this is insane. Where are the <em>Avengers</em>?</p> <p>From afar, Chrell is watching footage on a large screen with X'iv, and he pauses the image to ask for a genetic match on Hulkling. The computer is unable to identify Teddy due to the subject's form being in flux. This is due to the energy attack from the other Skrulls. Chrell tells it to extrapolate, and the computer states that there is a 57% match probability. Chrell is convinced that it is Dorrek and feels that it's fortunate that they attacked so quickly that they didn't recognize him. He can't believe that the prophesised savior of the Skrull Empire is living amongst them, and an <em>Avenger</em> no less. Chrell thinks that if news of his presence spread through their armada, it could instil confusion, and then doubt. Doubt is the enemy of faith. X'iV informs him that more heroes are coming. On Earth, the Initiative charge into action led by Gauntlet. Chrell doesn't think it matters. Their victory is promised to them.</p> <p>(New York City) <br/> The runaways have retreated to the Leapfrog which is cloaked atop a tall building. Nico looks after Karolina who is still unconscious. She hopes Karolina won't hate her for this. The Leapfrog's systems come online and he warns Nico and Victor that he has detected multiple spacecraft. Vic already knows, and he takes the 'Frog high into the air. Vic is feeling torn. He doesn't think this is right, but Nico asks him to trust her. It's her decision, and it might have been wrong, but their luck is only going to last so long, and this is too big. Vic replies that Xavin was going to help. He should have stayed with her. As Nico assures him that she needs him there, two extremely large Skrulls appear right in front of the Leapfrog; both ready to attack.</p> <p>On the ground, the heroes are struggling. Stature is battered to the ground, and Speed is concerned for Wiccan who can't seem to pull it together. Billy wants to find Teddy, but Speed tries to get through to him that they're going to <em>die</em> there.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Xavin has wriggled free of her shackles and flamed on. She lands on a building overlooking the action in semi-invisible mode. Xavin then looks over and sees a couple of Skrull ships coming in to land. This is band news, she feels. They're all going to die. She has to help. She then notices what the commotion is about. \"Oh no, no please... not him,\" she gasps. Two Skrulls step out onto the street. One of them is Chrell. He tells the other that he knows his orders. If their target talks, he will lie. He is a deceiver and a betrayer. He should treat him like the Kree he is. Xavin looks at the forlorn figure lying before them. \"Dorrek.\"</p> <p>Xavin acts quickly. He rockets in and causes an explosion between Teddy and the Skrulls. By the time the smoke dissipates, Chrell sees a hole in the ground and no sign of Dorrek. Xavin has taken him into the sewers beneath New York. As she drags him along as quickly as she can, she tries to wake him up. He finally wakes up, though he is still groggy. \"Billy... have to stop them...\" he whispers. Xavin agrees, but first he has to survive. That will actually require being conscious. \"They're coming, do you hear me?\" she warns. Xavin turns to see the tunnel behind them light up in flame. They are soon bundled over by a blast and sent sprawling into the water. Dorrek falls unconscious again, and by the time Xavin regains her facilities, she finds three Skrulls standing over them. Their leader says, \"Die sinners.\"</p>",

To end the onslaught of unprecedented cold and snow, the Ice Giant's Daughter demands that the gods of Asgard instruct the dwarves to forge for her their finest trinket.

Outraged, and perhaps a bit jealous, Odin takes the necklace from her. Even more indignant than Odin, Enchantress curses Midgard with a plague of the risen dead which only Thor can stop, piloting a Blood Colossus forged by Midgardian mortals.</div>",

The first newuniversal one-shot expands the mythos of this world, thanks to writer KIERON GILLEN (Phonogram), hand-picked by newuniversal’s Warren Ellis, and the brilliant art of GREG SCOTT shows us the world, like it never was…in 1959.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p>Trapped in a future she never made, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1447\" href=\"/layla-miller/4005-1447/\"> Layla Miller </a>finds herself smack in the middle of the Summers rebellion that was responsible for the eventual liberation of mutants from the camps. The only question is, will she survive it? <br /><br />Issue description:<br /><br />Layla has been waiting for the right moment to escape, and it happens when a piece of space debris falls from the sky over some guards. In Manhattan, she sees a mutant girl called <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57054\" href=\"/linqon/4005-57054/\"> Linqon </a>escaping from the police using her energy powers. She witness an mutant rights protest and makes two boys join the protest. With the help of a guy named Dwayne, she makes her way to Atlantic City . There she meets <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57040\" href=\"/ruby-summers/4005-57040/\"> Ruby Summers</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\"> Cyclops</a>'s daughter, who possess a black optic blast and an organic ruby form. She leads Layla to Cyclops, who now is an old man with cyborg parts. Cyclops attacks Layla and accuses her of being a monster for not using her knowledge to help mutant-kind. She tells him that she was aware of the bad things that happened to them and even to her, but she had to do them anyways. Cyclops forgives her and gives her new clothes. Layla then talks to Ruby and convinces her to follow the path of the X-Men and free mutant-kind. Ruby agrees and goes to New York, where she, Dwayne and Linqon rebel against the human oppressors with the help of other pro-mutant humans. This event went on to be known as the \"<a data-ref-id=\"4060-57538\" href=\"/summers-rebellion/4060-57538/\"> Summers Rebellion</a>\". <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />  ****Spoilers!!****<br /> <br /><strong>Full Summary <br /></strong>.</p>80 years in the future, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1447\" href=\"/layla-miller/4005-1447/\"> Layla </a>is in the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56868\" href=\"/mutant-containment-center-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/4020-56868/\"> internment camp</a> located in Sheepshead Bay that she and the dupe of Madrox were in, in the <a data-ref-id=\"4045-48995\" href=\"/messiah-complex/4045-48995/\"> Messiah Complex </a>arc. She is standing in the middle of a large X she had drawn in the dirt, facing one of the walls. She’s been in the same position for eight days, and the guards have dubbed her “The Statue”. They have a bet running on how long she’s going to stay that way. One guard is determined not to lose the hundred dollars riding on it and goes to make her go inside. She goes on about space junk and the guards ask what her point is. “We’re due,” she tells him, just before he is struck by a large metal, circular object. As she climbs over the junk to escape, she points out the irony that the program that used to monitor space junk was shut down to fund the camps.<br /> <br />In Atlantic City, an old man is sitting on a bench at the beach. A bright red hand is placed on his shoulder, asking her father to go inside. He replies that he knows “she” is coming today. She reminds him that he has been saying that every day for the past twenty years. He agrees, but looks a photo, regardless. It’s a young girl, with blonde hair covering her right eye.<br /> <br />Layla is walking through downtown Manhattan. She stops in front of a wig shot, looking in the window. A homeless man is sitting in front of the shop, and he asks what the ‘M’ is for. 'Miller' she tells him. She then breaks the glass window and takes a blonde wig. The man freaks out, asking if she’s nuts, now the police will come. She replies that that is what she’s counting on and so is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57054\" href=\"/linqon/4005-57054/\"> Linqon</a>. Just then, a blue haired girl is running down the street, being chased by two police cursers demanding her surrender. Someone walking behind Layla throws a lit cigarette on the ground, and Linqon runs up to Layla. Layla assures her that everything will be fine, just as the cars that were pursuing Linqon crash into one that was arriving because of Layla breaking into the store. Gasoline leaks from the cars onto the cigarette on the ground and the cars ignite. Linqon takes advantage of it and takes off.<br /> <br /><a data-ref-id=\"4005-71344\" href=\"/dwayne/4005-71344/\"> Dwayne</a>, a blonde car thief, sees this and becomes interested in how Layla was able to do it. He follows her to a mutant rights protest and watches as she approaches two guys who are talking about how the camps don’t affect them. She engages them in conversation and convinces them that the government is about to implement a program that will hold anyone with mutants in their bloodline going back ten generations in captivity for observation indefinitely. This changes their minds and they join in the protest. Dwayne steps out of the shadows, she Layla tells him she knows his name and that he’s a car thief. Even more impressed, he agrees to give her a ride from Manhattan to Atlantic City. When he asks her what’s in Atlantic City, her response is just as enigmatic; “Once I’m there? Me.” However, he does just that.<br /> <br />When they arrive in Atlantic City, Dwayne is trying to convince Layla that there is absolutely nothing there and hasn’t been for ten years. She asks him if she really believes that, then why did he drive here there? He says he didn’t know he had a choice. She reminds him that everyone has choices, then corrects herself and admits, except her. He asks her what she means, and she tells him that because she knows what everyone’s going to do, she doesn’t have the right to make her own decisions. Dwayne tells Layla he has no idea what she’s talking about, then admits that he drove her because he really had nothing better to do. His explanation is cut short, however, as they are attacked by a blast of energy that hits the ground directly in front of Dwayne. The <a data-ref-id=\"4005-57040\" href=\"/ruby-summers/4005-57040/\"> woman </a>from before appears and tells them to get lost, then freezes. “Wait... you?”<br />“I get that a lot.” is her response. “You’re his daughter.” The woman tells Layla that ‘he’ is waiting for her. Layla goes off and Ruby helps Dwayne stand. He introduces himself and she tells him her name. He asks if it’s just a coincidence, and Ruby says it was Layla who told her parents to name her that.<br /> <br />When Layla sees <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\"> Cyclops</a>, she runs towards him, elated to see a truly familiar presence, only to be slapped away. He proceeds to call her a monster and blame her for everything that has happened to him. When he demands that she look at what has become of him, both his left arm and leg are robotic as well as a metal plate over his left eye. This finally gives her a chance to respond and she breaks down in tears. She reminds him that she did know what was going to happen, and that includes knowing what was going to happen to her. She did everything knowing what was going to happen. She used to have terrible nightmares about what they would do to her in the camp, but she did it anyways because she knew it had to happen. “You think if I had the power to make things not happen, I wouldn’t have used it to save myself? <strong><em>You think I wanted this?</em></strong>” She pounds on his chest, calling him names and begging him to kill her if that’s what he wants. She doesn’t care how, but she wants him to kill her because she’s just so tired of knowing. Scott realises how wrong he was about her and he kneels down and holds her as she sobs promising her that everything will be okay.<br /> <br />Later, Ruby marvelling at the situation of taking the picture of Layla that her father has been caring for decades. After it’s done, Scott asks Layla if she knows how she’s going to get back. She says no, and he’s surprised. He offers to tell her, but she says no. It’s safer to assume that if she doesn’t know something, it’s for a reason. Scott then tells her that he’s got clothing set aside for her.<br /> <br />After changing, they’re in a ruined casino and Layla’s asking Ruby how long they’ve been hiding in Atlantic City. Ruby informs her they’ve been there for years. Cyclops is mostly using power cells for energy and as long as Ruby stays in her ruby form, she doesn’t require food. When Layla inquires about what would happen if she switched to her human form, the Summers woman admits that she doesn’t know. She’s been in that form for so many years that if she were to go back, she may age almost seventy years is seconds. In need for a change of subject, Layla brings up Linqon. She tells Ruby she’s a new mutant in New York, helpless and afraid. Ruby doesn’t understand the point. “She needs your help. Because things are about to change. It’s your time.” Ruby walks away from her, but Layla follows her, insistent. She reminds the older woman about her father’s dream, and Ruby admits that yes, she heard the story, but she also heard about all the mutants who died because of it, the ’norms’ who rejoiced in their deaths and that the ones who didn’t die ended up in camps. Layla reminds her that she experienced it firsthand, but normal people are starting to come around and that by helping Linqon, it will start the revolution. Ruby begins to challenge that, but Cyclops interrupts, Dwayne beside him, and says that they have nothing to lose because they aren’t really living as it is. Ruby smiles and says she did know that, but she wasn’t sure he did. “Layla... to hell with getting the apple cart rolling. Let’s kick the damn thing over.”<br /> <br />In the city, the President is giving a speech over television screens in the street. He is saying that they don’t know how the plans for ‘Operation Purity’ became public before they were ready to implement it, but because it has, they are not going to deny it. The people must trust in their elected leaders to make the tough decisions, testing centers are being set up and all citizens will be required to submit for genetic testing. “And for those who believe that they are exempt from the law... Incentive will be provided.” As he gives the threat, Sentinels rise on either side of the main screen. A man with a megaphone is yelling that their country has gone insane. The President is still going on about how the testing is being done out of love. “War is peace. Hatred is acceptance.” Ruby can’t take anymore of the speech. She shoots one Sentinel through the head before yelling “And <strong><em>up</em></strong> is down! And <strong><em>down </em></strong>is where <strong><em>you</em></strong> are going!” Linqon looks up from the crowd to see Ruby and Dwayne on a rooftop. She introduces herself. She says she is a mutant and she knows most of them are not. But it’s time they stand together and say that it’s enough. It is time to rebel.<br /> <br />As the battle rages, civilians and Ruby’s team against Sentinels and the police force, Layla walks right through the thick of it writing in her diary. The stuff that is happening around her will be known as the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-57538\" href=\"/summers-rebellion/4060-57538/\"> Summers’ Rebellion</a>. What will happen next, she’s still not really sure of and that’s unsettling. It makes her too much like everybody else and she doesn’t want to be like everyone else. Right now she’s having a good time being Layla Miller and knowing stuff.  <p><br /></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>To save the woman he loves, the greatest hero of all time becomes the pawn of ultra-dimensional forces when a wounded emissary from a world of doomed super gods comes to Earth on the eve of the Final Crisis. His mission: recruit Superman's help against an epic, reality-spanning menace that originated in the Crisis on Infinite Earths!</em></p><p>The issue starts with Superman being blasted by what looks to be a Monitor, who is chipping away at Superman’s \"cosmic armor\". We follow Superman back in time to see Clark Kent sitting next to Lois Lane's hospital bed saying that he'll do anything to save her. The Monitor Zillo Valla shows up and stops time, saying that if Superman helps her, she will save Lois' life. Superman follows her to her ship, where it is being attacked by another ship. Superman realizes that Zillo Valla has recruited Supermen of other universes to help in her mission: Ultraman from the Anti-Matter Earth, Captain Marvel of Earth-5, Overman of Earth-10, and Captain Allen Adam, the \"Quantum Superman\" (and a Doctor Manhattan look-alike), of Earth-4. The enemy ship takes damage from Ultraman and crash lands on Earth-51, part of the \"graveyard universe\", named that after the fight between Superman-Prime and Monarch destroyed most of the universe. The Monitor's ship then lands in Limbo, where the Supermen are greeted by Merryman. Superman and Captain Marvel make their way to the Library of Limbo to see the one book that Merryman tells them is there.</p><p>When they get to the Library, they see that the book is a book with an infinite number of pages, all occupying the same space. Superman and Captain Marvel realize that if they can get the book to the ship, the ship will be able to process all of the infinite number of stories and would figure a way to fix itself. When they try to pick up the book, it starts to tell them a story about the Monitors.</p><p>The story says that there was one Monitor who was as large as the void itself, but a flaw was found in it. To contain this flaw, the Monitor creates the Multiverse to contain it, but it didn’t foresee the birth of complex life within the Multiverse. So the Monitor sends out a probe, possibly the original Monitor from <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>, to investigate the abnormality within the flaw. It witnesses the events of the original Crisis and encounters the concept of \"stories\" and feels threatened by the existence of \"stories\", realizing that it has no defense against it. The Monitor seals the flaw, and all that seems to remain is a statue of Superman, dubbed \"a vast, uncanny form\". After eons of the form standing idle, the race of Monitors develops around it. They determine, after a few eons, that the form must be some sort of weapon that will help them against some ultimate enemy. Meanwhile, as blood falls from the sky, presumably from the Bleed, the Eater of Life, called Mandrakk, senses his freedom.</p><p>There is suddenly a burst of lightning as Superman and Marvel are blasted back from the book and Marvel is transformed back into Billy Baston, who can't remember who he is or his magic word. Superman makes his way back to the ship, telling Captain Adam that he’ll need his help to get the book. Demanding answers, Superman rips off Zillo Valla's door, only to see her sucking out the blood, vampire-style, of Overman. It turns out that she needs to drain \"life\" from Overman in order to power her ship. Valla tells Superman that the destroyer from earlier is considered Mandrakk's nanotechnology and the he has found them. Captain Adam tells Superman to come outside; the sky has just shattered. The sky has turned red, Ultraman is holding the infinite book and saying that evil wins, and a ship bearing, what looks like, Brainiac’s symbol appears in the sky.</p>",

            "description": "<p>(somewhere in the Milky Way, two days ago)</p><p>A Majesdanian space ship flies through space with four Majesdanians on board; deHalle, vaDanti, vaRikk and the General. They are survivors of Majesdane's destruction, and they blame Karolina Dean for that disaster. The Majesdanians pick up Karolina's signal on Earth, and they decide to travel there. The fiesty deHalle marks her revenge.</p><p>(Earth, present, on the outskirts of Los Angeles)</p><p>The runaways return to the City of Angels after their run-in with the Kingpin, the Punisher and some Skrulls in New York City. Chase listens to his his favorite DJ, Val Rhymin on KZIT. Victor and Xavin aren't sure of where to go, but Nico suggests they ask the Leapfrog where to go - the Leapfrog, being the Pride's ships, would know all their locations. The Leapfrog informs them that there is a place in Malibu that is unbreached, but the alarms are still active. Xavin, curious, asks who lived in Malibu; Chase replies that he did as a kid, but he assumed his parents had sold the place.</p><p>(later, at night)</p><p>The Leapfrog lands off the Pacific coast; the Runaways don't want to directly land on the Malibu house due to fear of setting off alarms. Xavin creates a watertight forcefield bubble for them to travel in, and Chase tells Old Lace that they'll be back for her when the coast is clear. Klara loves the excitement, though Chase would have preferred to land on the roof - there is a perfect spot for the Leapfrog.</p><p>Soon, they are on the beach, and Karolina welcomes Vic to Malibu. They walk up to the house and check the place out. It's a lot more desirable than their previous two hostels. Victor and Karolina decide to hack into the alarm system while Chase and Xavin check the front door. Nico and Klara go off to break into windows, but Molly attempts to break into the home on her own - being the strongest on the team.</p><p>Although Xavin manages to use her Mr. Fantastic arm into unlocking the door from the inside, she alerts a horde of security daemons that attack all the runaways; Karolina is grabbed by a prehistoric bird-like daemon, while Victor is attacked by a gorilla-like daemon with a slingshot. From the inside, Chase attempts to turn off a daemon by pressing a switch on the back of its head, but Molly arrives in time to smash it into the wall, breaking the daemon and the wall in the process. Karolina, becoming fed up of being carried around explodes the robot carrying her and wonders why they ever arrived at the house in Malibu.</p><p>Once the drama is over, the kids start getting rid of the evidence; Xavin shape-shifts into the form of handsome young man and informs the neighbors that they just moved in. Klara learns more about television and YouTube. Nico urges Chase to get a job; Chase, meanwhile, discovers the Stein's garage - there is a motorbike, a camper van and a VW bus.</p><p>(the next day, at the mall)</p><p>Molly, Nico, Karolina and Klara arrive at the base of the mall - Chase is applying for a job, at KZIT radio station hosted by his idol, Val Rhymin. Although Karolina is appalled Chase is applying for a job hosted by \"sexist pigs\", Nico doesn't care where he works so long as he works.</p><p>At the top of the mall, Val Rhymin is on air, slouched in his chair, while Chase watches through the public window. Val spots him and jokes to his listeners that it looks like one of the monkeys has escaped from the zoo to \"sip at the font of knowledge\". Val continues his speech about overthrowing the government... this angers the station manager, Bob, who warns Val not to say those things on the radio. The two enter a heated argument, resulting in Bob telling Val he's fired. Val turns away from Bob... but it is at this moment where Bob clutches his chest - he's going into a heart attack, but Val is utterly calm and pretends not to notice.</p><p>Chase does not notice Bob suffering, so he tells Val he idolises him and wants to work with him. Outside the office, Val notices (from the corner of his eye) a pained Bob disappearing over the balcony... he smiles at Chase and tells him his luck may be in. He thinks an opening's just come up.</p><p>As Bob falls towards his death, from below Klara, Molly, Nico and Karolina and the other shoppers look up after hearing a scream. Klara wastes no time springing into action. Calling out, \"Grow!\" the mall plantlife shoots up creating a jungle, catching Bob safely. While Klara helps Bob land and tells the plants to lie down, the other Runaways praise her and the four of them leave before the cops show up.</p><p>(later, at the Malibu home)</p><p>Victor finishes washing the Leapfrog in its new location. Molly, Klara, Nico and Karolina arrive, informing Xavin about their experience - just this moment, Chase arrives and asks why they left him alone at the mall. Nico, however, dodges the question and asks Chase why he let Bob fall from the balcony. Chase, angry with Nico, begins to have an arguement before Victor shuts him up... he hears something. Karolina's energies erupt as a blindling flash of light comes through the window... bursting through the wall, the Majesdanians have arrived for revenge.</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>Characters making their first appearance in the series include Chase's new boss, Val Rhymin and the Majesdanians, deHalle, vaDanti, vaRikk and the General. The General isn't named until issue #6 (January 2009) as vaDrann.Val's boss, Bob appears, but he also dies the next issue.</p><p>The VW bus makes its first appearance this issue, but it will later return as a regular means of transport for Chase in issue #6 (January 2009).</p><p>In this issue, Xavin briefly shape-shifts into movie director Kevin Smith. The FCC and YouTube are also referenced. Val Rhymin plays a song by Led Zeppelin.</p>",

Travelling deep into the dark belly of the sea, the men of the good ship, Voyager, are about to see things that defy description, that supersede their wildest imagination -- things that men aren’t meant to see.

Broussard’s work is laid bare in this unique collection of the first three issues of this new volume.<br/><br/>Jackie Estacado, the current wielder of The Darkness power, joins forces with a brilliant scientist, who teaches the former Mob boss how to turn his curse into a blessing. Together, the duo overthrow a small South American country and turn its people into addicts of Nightfall, a synthetic drug made from The Darkness. But what Jackie doesn’t know is that the professor has a sinister, ulterior motive that will turn The Darkness powers against him, and he’ll be lucky if he gets out of this alive!<br/><br/>Even if you’ve read these issues before you’ll appreciate how Broussard, under Marc Silvestri’s guidance, has matured into a talented penciler in his own right.</p>",

In a touching tale of death and acceptance originally presented in X-MEN UNLIMITED #13, the X-Man Colossus continues to mourn the loss of his beloved sister, the teleporting mutant mystic known as Magik. Meanwhile, in a story from NEW X-MEN #37, Magik’s origin is explored — and her former master, the demon-lord Belasco returns! Fighting his way through hostile terrain and vicious demon hordes, Belasco will stop at nothing to wrest control of Limbo. But the evil sorceress standing in his way bears a striking resemblance to his former protégé. And finally, from X-MEN: DIVIDED WE STAND #2, Magik has indeed returned — but she’s trapped in Limbo, a slave to Belasco!

They surround it and shoot it but it is revealed that Deadpool is behind the mask. He quickly takes care of the Skrulls but more of them are already arriving. A cannon from a ship blasts the suit but it is empty. They wonder where Deadpool is before realizing that he is on top of the ship. A Super Skrull is sent out to kill him but he is able to blow up the ship. Then he easily takes care of the Super Skrull but allows himself to be captured and taken to the leader. The issue ends with Deadpool saying, \"Ready for duty sir!\"</p>",

Not only is he an X-Man who’s very familiar with the future, he’s also a highly-trained soldier who knows how to cover his tracks and leave dozens of down-and-dirty traps in his wake.

But he wouldn’t be the hard-boiled hero he was if he didn’t go sniffing after trouble. Hero? Randall stopped the laugh in his throat. Drowned it in a slug of bourbon. Randall’s no hero. 1920s Los Angeles just ain’t the time or the place for a guy like that. Ain’t the time or place for the Immortal Iron Fist. Orson Randall’s just trying to figure the angle. And if he has to unload his .45s to do it, so much the better. Orson Randall’s just in it for the skirt.<br /><br /><br />Summary;<br /><br />Orson retells the story of how he met the one woman who still leaves his lips burning. He had come to meet with a man named George...when she walked in. Her name was Galatea an her voice enchanted him, she knew what she wanted an she wanted him. Soon after taking her home she left, an Orson went to go an see what had happen to George. Finding George dead on the floor of his house, police burst into the house seeing him the murderer he breaks past the police. Knowing she had something to do with him being set up he went looking, following leads to a man named Simmon he searches his office finding pictures of the woman an other personas one of them being a Darlene she had used. Soon Simmon himself came his men at his cue began to beat Orson yet he was able to escape their grasp after a few blows an with his own tricks escaped. After escaping Orson donning his Ironfist persona an mask made his way back to Galatea apartment only to find three woman saying their Galatea? The three women powers enchanted him again an almost took him over until a woman in red came to his rescue (Corny yeah) it was Darlene. As soon as they were in the free they were again surrounded by men in hooded cloaks under the leadership of one man...Simmon. Simmons cult followed an worshiped Baba Fu, the woman behind Ironfist Galatea was to be Baba Fu's vessal for this world. Doing as she is told Darlene puts Ironfist under her thrall an he is tossed around the room an beaten by the followers.  But soon Ironfist took out the two things they had forgotten...his two .45s.  The firefight began an soon an explosion erupted within the mansion, finding Darlene he wraps his arms around her only to feel the cold embrace of a knife in his back. Darlene tells him she wanted to be their queen an that all he was doing was stopping that, as Ironfist attempts at swaying her from her decision telling her that they killed her father the floor gives way an Ironfist tries to grab for Darlene but she falls to a firey grave. <br /><br />After the incident Ironfist sits again in a coffeeshop contemplating how he could not save Darlene while the three women swoon over him telling him to put the mask back on. Grateful for him saving them from Simmon they never left his side.</p>",

But when the Demi-Gods pushed the mighty Giants into oblivion, they became the lords of the planet. Nevertheless, mere humans were not the appropriate companion for the demi-gods and they built Asgard as a haven for all that was blessed. When the Giants were aware of this, they knew it was the moment for payback and what could be sweeter than use Thor himself as their pawn of revenge.<br /><br />As Asgard fell, dark creatures began invading the human Empire. Even with the help of Thor, now calling himself the Stormbringer, the Empire was impotent to stop its demise caused by the dark horde led by Master Mayhem. Now, Leviticus Cross stands as the last remaining bastion of the Empire, but a growing fear against superhuman beings is spreading among its inhabitants unaware the maybe these rejects from society are the only hope for mankind.</i>",

That's right, the next chapter of the MZ saga is a non-stop in-continuity gorefest with major implications for at least one Marvel hero! When the super-undead stumble into the MU from the Man-Thing's Nexus of All Realities, all of Florida is quarantined against the zombie plague. Time is quickly running out for a cure, so the Initiative sends a most unlikely group of heroes into the Zombieverse on a desperate mission to find the one item they need before the whole MU is consumed!</i></p><h3><strong>Summary:</strong></h3><p>The Command consisting of Aquarian, Conquistador, Jennifer Kale, and Siege are prowling Citrusville Florida at the Swamp Monster Tour grounds. They got reports of zombies in the area including one in a costume. The Command stumbles at the zombie area and all of a sudden a zombie bits Siege in the face. The other Zombies then tear Conquistador's body apart. All of a sudden the zombie version of Deadpool pops out, injuring Jennifer Kale's arms to prevent her from using magic and bites Aquarian on the neck. Jennifer Kale turns on a giant propeller and signals to Aquarian, whom then blasts Deadpool into it which slices him in many pieces. After that Aquarian shields himself as he puts himself into suspended animation to try to purge the infection. The zombie Siege then tries to eat Jennifer Kale but Siege's mechanical body turns on him and destroys his head.</p><p>Elsewhere a zombie leaves the swamp only to be killed by Man-Thing.</p><p>At A.R.M.O.R. Morbius has become the head scientist. He gets a message from zombie Deadpool and claims that Deadpool lead the Command to the swamp as a trap and that Deadpool or the virus as entered the real world and wants to spread the zombie virus to super humans in order to spread faster. At this point Morbius is trying to find a cure for the zombie virus that came from the zombie dimension which Deadpool escaped from, but he needs blood from a non-bitten person from that dimension to make the cure work.</p><p>A.R.M.O.R. director Charles Little Sky then gets Machine Man and Jocasta(who haven't seen each other since they defeated Ulton with the Thing), and both of them transport to the zombie dimension to get the blood they need.</p><p>Morbius then goes into a hidden room in the lab. In the lab is the real Morbius beaten up, bound, and being injected with an anticoagulant. The other Morbius turns out to be the zombie version of Morbius who is undercover.</p>",

            "description": "<p>WHAT IS THE SECRET REASON WOLVERINE JOINED THE X-MEN?</p><p>The X-Men event of the fall begins in this one-shot! For years, Logan has been a man without a past, whose memories existed only as conflicting fragments. And Charles Xavier has been a master of his own mind and others. Now the tables are turned, and as WOLVERINE struggles to rescue his son, DAKEN, from the evil and darkness that have consumed him, PROFESSOR X comes face-to-face with the most terrifying secret of all!</p><p>Beginning here and continuing in the pages of X-MEN LEGACY and WOLVERINE: ORIGINS this month and next, ORIGINAL SIN is sure to turn your expectations on their head!</p><p>Also featuring a reprint of \"First Night\" by Chris Claremont and John Bolton, originally published in Classic X-Men #1</p><h4>SPOILERS</h4><h4>Chapter 1</h4><p>The issue starts with Wolverine remembering back when he was first asked to join the X-men, and that he was the only one of the new group that actually knew why he was there. Back to the present Logan meets up with an old friend who is hiding from the Chinese Government, he asks of the man known as Tso Ren Wu to keep an eye on his son Daken and make sure he stays calm. And that if Logan doesn`t return to take him off the grid.</p><p>Soon Wolverine makes his way back to the mansion and finds Emma and Scott, smelling the scent of Charles, Wolverine becomes enraged. He screams at Scott that they, both, should have told Logan that Charles was still around in the land of the living. He attacks Scott and Emma breaks them up, Logan states that Scott is still letting his women fight for him. A statement that causes another short argument, before Emma breaks it up again, she puts her hands on Logan, only for him, to swat her away like a fly calling her by White Queen. She asks \"This is how its going to be?\" And Logan continues to walk saying \"No...its just the way it is.\" Walking out of the hanger bay.</p><p>Back in Tokyo Wolverine makes his way through the city, while Tso and Daken are kept in the dark from other eyes from a distraction by Tso's men.</p><p>Miss Sinister sits in a diner/bar watching Wolverine.</p><h4>Chapter 2</h4><p>As he walks the streets he can smell Charles and soon runs into him. Charles was waiting for Logan an sipping on a glass of coffee, Logan sits down an stares at Charles.</p><p>In another part of Tokyo, Daken is with Tso and a woman, he attempts to leave, but the woman stops him from doing so. But, soon apologies for her brash behavior, as he looks out the window he gets a pounding headache as someone speaks to him within his mind its Miss Sinister. She calls him to the roof, he asks her what she is doing and she tells him \"Looking for you.\" that he is a hard man to find. Not believing her nor knowing who she is he tries to dismiss her telling her he is waiting for a friend to which she responds \"Logan is no friend of yours.\" that he was the one who did this to him. He doesn't believe her and that Logan was the man to help him out of the \"cave\" he was in. Leaving Miss sinister on the roof she says that he will burn.</p><p>Back with Logan an Charles, Logan begins to tell more about Daken and that he is his son. Charles is amazed that Logan has a son. Then as the discussion continues Logan asks for Charles to wipe Dakens mind of all the brainwashing and all the mess in his mind. Charles barks back that he cant do that, that he has done it too often and its destroyed people. Logan wants Daken's mind wiped so that afterward he can choose to either be a killer or something better.</p><p>Charles still not wanting to do it says no that he WILL NOT do what Logan asks. Logan pops out his claws and \"I wasn't asking.\"</p><p>Above where Daken is staying two choppers sound off above it, and with a grin a pilot talking with Miss Sinister drops two napalms onto the home. The woman with Daken tries to warn him before the blast but is too late, and as the explosion erupts she is devoured in the flames. The choppers land and the men walk into the inferno looking for the remains of Daken only to fined a infuriated Daken and he ends both their lives at the ends of his claws. Miss Sinister walks in, Daken screams at her if she was the one to do it. She nods telling him yes that it was to show him what he truly is and if it makes him sad that he should stay an cry about it , but if it reminds him of old times that he should come an play with her.</p><p>Logan asks Charles what he sees? Referring to the reflection in his claws. Charles says his claws in a sarcastic remark, and Logan asks again. Charles finally replies \"I see me\" he asks Logan if hes trying to show him something about himself. Logan says no that hes showing him the truth, that the professor made him. Broke him into little pieces and put him back together from those pieces. Charles doesn't understand stating that the memories were always there that they were there the first time they met. Logan tells him to read his mind, and Charles says no. Logan chuckles saying \"You afraid to find out the truth the whole story that. That that day they first met he let him in the door, knowing full well I was sent to kill you.\"</p><p>Too be Continued.</p>",

The hard parts of life are love and hope. From a touching relationship between Jonathan and his aging great aunt, to an inebriated evening with an amorous, octogenarian dwarf, to the devastating aftermath of 9/11, Ames's first original graphic novel, with gritty, poignant art by Dean Haspiel (THE QUITTER), tells a story at once hilarious, excruciating, bizarre and universal, about how our lives fall to pieces and the enduring human struggle to put things back together again.</i><i><br/></i> <br/>Hardcover Release Date: October 01, 2008 <br/>Softcover Release Date: September 16, 2009",

            "description": "<i>\"New Krypton\" part 3! At last! The true origin of the Guardian of Metropolis is revealed! Following directly on from last month's SUPERMAN'S PAL, JIMMY OLSEN SPECIAL #1, we learn the fantastic and sometimes terrible past of one of DC's most mysterious heroes. How did the first clone of the Golden Age Guardian come into existence at the hands of the Cadmus Project? We'll also introduce a mysterious young girl the Guardian has sworn to protect – even at the expense of the Cadmus Project, and, if need be, his very life</i>! <br /> <br />The comic begins when Jimmy Olsen shows up at Jim Harper's (The Guardian) home to ask him questions about Cadmus.Harper starts the story from the very beginning.As people know Cadmus had been creating all types of different creatures but the one that Harper had found was wearing a Legion of Superheroes ring and that's when he got suspicious.The book then drifts into the effects of being a clone of the real Jim Harper as he takes Jimmy back through his origin.When Harper looks further into the Cadmus project he not only finds out that Cadmus planned to destroy Superman but that they were making monstrous clones from the same DNA that he was spawned from.To preserve his own humanity he destroyed the clones..burned them alive.From the depictions shown afterwards one is to assume that Harper's daughter whom we meet during Jimmy's exit is just a clone as well.At the conclusion of it all Jimmy is still proud to know Harper and to have spoke with him,he still views him as a great hero although he thinks his legacy was built on fabrication and as for Harper he plans to come face to face with his \"father's killer\" the Assassin Jonathan Drew..to gain some closure.",

Practically from out of nowhere, the mysterious masked killer known as Onomatopoeia returns and sets his sights – and sounds – against The Caped Crusader!</i></p><p>Readers will be granted access to several villains from the Batman rogues gallery - some you know well, such as the Joker - while others range from B-list to rare. Prepare for some disturbing imagery in this first issue of the three-parter. Smith takes this pool of villains and pits them against each other while all of them have the Batman and the police to also worry about.</p><p>The major plotline is that someone has taken the Joker's poison and cut down with other ingredients to create a new club drug called Chuckles. It's worse than Xstacy and is taking over the street scene. Needless to say than anyone utilizing Joker \"technology\" without his express approval is in more than trouble than a copyright lawsuit.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Long before his memories were restored, the X-Man known as Wolverine spent years seeking to unlock the mysteries of his past. Some of those memories were best left forgotten. Join Charles Xavier as he journeys deep into Wolverine's mind on a quest for answers that will shed new light on one of the darkest periods of Logan's life -- his days in the Weapon X program! It's a brand-new look at the horrifying history of Marvel's most prominent mutant! PLUS: Each issue features a 10-page back-up story featuring an important player from Wolverine's past! First up, an untold tale of Wolvie's arch-nemesis, the mutant madman known as Sabretooth!</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><h4>Part 1, Don't Look Back in Anger</h4><p>Logan approaches Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. In his mind he knows that he has found a place to call home. As he draws nearer, Kitty informs him that the Danger Room is prepped for a practice session. Wolverine bows out of practice in order to have a one-on-one session with Xavier. He muses about how everyone else knows who they are. He, on the other hand, is still searching. Sitting down with Professor Xavier, the two discuss the next possible solution to figuring out where Wolverine came from. Xavier has tried everything. He does have an idea, though. He'd like Wolverine to accompany him into Wolverine's own mind, a dangerous idea, since Xavier will need total trust and cooperation, something hard to come by with someone as capricious as Wolverine is.</p><p>Xavier begins the experiment. Once in Wolverine's mind, the two men find themselves trapped in a cubic, stone room. Xavier explains that the walls have been erected by Wolverine himself. Not one to be held back by barriers, Wolverine attempts to rip the walls down. The stone is easy enough, but there is a tougher barrier immediately behind it. Xavier explains that Wolverine's mind isn't so easy to navigate. Wolverine's subconscious must have some things it wants to keep hidden. Wolverine exerts all he has and finally rips through the outer wall. He and Xavier step through the hole to find shards, fragments, of Wolverine's memories: fighting the Hulk, running with wolves, and hanging out with Captain America, among others. Wolverine is stumped, sure that some of the memories must be false since some look to be from ages in the past. Xavier hypothesizes that Wolverine must be older than originally thought, something aided by Wolverine's healing factor. Wolverine can't place many of the memories. Sabretooth steps from the recesses of Wolverine's mind and offers to help.</p><p>The two battle, but when Wolverine goes for the kill, he learns that Sabretooth really is just a figment of his mind. Sabretooth then relates a simple story in which he and Wolverine had been on the same team years back. Memories flood and Wolverine sees his abduction at the hands of some goons. He asks where he was taken and Sabretooth shows a large penitentiary-like place. Sabretooth refuses to enter; he's had his fill with the place. Wolverine and Xavier enter and see Wolverine's body in the Weapon X tanks. This story continues in the next issue.</p><h4>The Recruit</h4><p>Sabretooth approaches an old cabin in the Canadian wilderness. He crumples up an invitation and tries to shake the feeling that he is about to be drafted into some cause. In the cabin, Sabretooth is greeted by a shadowed, bald man. The stranger acknowledges that Sabretooth has a reputation for tracking, a point that led to inviting him in the first place. The stranger then comments on Sabretooth's past, like when he went rogue on a Team X mission or about his father abusing him. The stranger then explains that Sabretooth's many gifts have prepared him for the stranger's program. Sabretooth refuses to think he can do anything worthwhile, but the stranger simply says it is in Sabretooth's hands to prove the world wrong about who he's become. The program, says the stranger, is to help find people. The stranger slides a folder marked \"Classified: Weapon X,\" and explains that Sabretooth knows the person to be located first. Opening the file, Sabretooth sees Wolverine's face and gets angry. He charges the stranger but freezes in mid-stride. The stranger turns out to be Xavier. He wheels himself out of harm's way and puts into Sabretooth's mind that the meeting had never happened. When Sabretooth awakens, he feels as if he's just woken from a bad dream. He leaves, mulling over a though Xavier left in his mind: a war is coming.</p>",

In Asgard, though…no one can quite remember WHAT happened to him. How did he live? How did he die? And why does everyone in Asgard remember it differently? There's trickery at hand so vile even Loki joins Thor in trying to unravel it. Some comics are giant-sized. Some are king-sized. Only THIS comic can be called GOD-SIZED! By Matt Fraction (THOR: AGES OF THUNDER) and a roster of all-star artists including Doug Braithwaite (SECRET INVASION: THOR), Dan Brereton (IMMORTAL IRON FIST ANNUAL) and Marko Djurdjevic (THOR #7-8)!</i></p><p>The tale of Skurge the Executioner is known to all in Asgard, as is how Skurge died single-handedly defending the Asgardians from the forces of Hela. Thor encounters Balder who is musing over the details of the tale. The two gods realize that their recollection of the life of Skurge was vastly different. Thor immediately senses Loki's trickery. Upon interrogating Loki, Thor realizes that her recollection of the tale is different than either of theirs.</p><p>The three embark for Hel to determine what actually happened to Skurge. There they find exactly how deep the trickery runs as even Hela herself finds that her memory of Skurge has been tampered with. Upon exiting Hel the three find that they are mysteriously riding horses where they weren't before, and their attire has changed as well (Loki is back to being a man). After battling the dark elves and then a frost giant (and going through another transformation) they find themselves at Yggdrasil, the world tree. Enchantress is at the base of the Yggdrasil, stricken with grief and trying to reform Skurge from the roots of the world tree itself. The changes in their memories had been caused by Enchantress tampering with the very essence of the nine worlds and threatening the existence of all.</p><p>Through Loki's trickery, Thor is able to defeat the Enchantress and destroy the still-forming body of Skurge in the world tree, saving all worlds.</p>",

A Marvel Comics mainstay since 1964, Daredevil got a new lease on life in a landmark 1979-1983 run by writer-penciler Frank Miller and inker-penciler Klaus Janson, whose daring reinvention of the character quickly made Miller one of the biggest and most influential stars in the comic-book industry. Miller put his own stamp on established cast members such as reporter Ben Urich, femme fatale Black Widow, mad assassin Bullseye, the saw-fisted Gladiator, and monstrous crime boss Kingpin. Miller also introduced Daredevil's mysterious mentor Stick, deadly ninja foes the Hand, and Matt's long-lost love Elektra, a beautiful assassin who would become one of Marvel's most memorable characters. Mixing traditional super-heroics with mysterious martial artistry, doomed romance, and dark personal drama, Miller's character-defining DD run is collected across three titanic trade paperbacks! Collecting Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #27-28, and Daredevil #158-161 and #163-172</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>It's the Ultimate Monster versus the Ultimate Machine in Ultimate Human! All Bruce Banner wanted was a cure. All Tony Stark wanted to do was help. But in typical Ultimate Universe style, human failings and political intrigue get in the way, leading to a primal battle between humanity and technology as the two titanic Ultimates square off in a ferocious test of opposing strengths. It's a battle between the Hulk, the most awesome emblem of brute force in existence, and Iron Man, whose keenly enhanced physiology represents the bleeding edge of science and technology. And in any such battle, expect massive collateral damage! As the political intrigue and long-buried secrets are slowly revealed in writer Warren Ellis' own inimitable way, expect to be shocked, surprised and overcome with the kind of seat-of-your-pants, comic-reading glee that is a hallmark of the Ultimate reading experience. Marking artist Cary Nord's triumphant return to Marvel, ULTIMATE HUMAN is the next key chapter in the ongoing Ultimate saga!</i></p><p><i>Collecting ULTIMATE HUMAN #1-4.</i></p><p>Reprint ISBN 978-0-7851-2015-5<i><br /></i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>THE ACCLAIMED 2008 DEBUT, BACK IN PRINT IN A 2010 SOFTCOVER!</i></p><p><i><b>Abandoned Cars</b> is Tim Lane’s first collection of graphic short stories, noir-ish narratives that are united by their exploration of the great American mythological drama by way of the desperate and haunted characters that populate its pages. Lane’s characters exist on the margins of society—alienated, floating in the void between hope and despair, confused but introspective. Some of them are experiencing the aftermath of an existential car crash—those surreal moments after a car accident, when time slows down and you’re trying to determine what just happened and how badly you’re hurt. Others have gone off the deep end, or were never anywhere but the deep end. Some are ridiculous, others dignified in their efforts to struggle to make sense of, and cope with, the absurdities, outrages, ghosts, and poisons in their lives.</i></p><p><i>The writing is straightforward, the stories mainstream but told in a pulpy idiom with an existential edge, often in the first person, reminiscent of David Goodis’s or Jim Thompson’s prose or of films like <b>Pick-Up on South Street or Out of the Past</b>. Visually, Lane’s drawing is in a realistic mode, reminiscent of Charles Burns, that heightens the tension in stories that veer between naturalism on the one hand and the comical, nightmarish, and hallucinatory on the other. Here, American culture is a thrift store and the characters are thrift store junkies living among the clutter. It’s an America depicted as a subdued and haunted Coney Island, made up of lost characters—boozing, brawling, haplessly shooting themselves in the face, and hopping freight trains in search of Elvis.</i></p><p><i><b>Abandoned Cars</b> is an impressive debut of a major young American cartoonist.</i></p>",

Set in the present time, <b>The Last Musketeer</b> stars the by-now centuries old musketeer Athos, who has been reduced to a suavely dressed but useless near-panhandler trading on his now almost extinct fame. All this changes when one day the Martians attack Earth. Suddenly there is a need for swashes to be buckled, and Athos leaps back into the fray with a vengeance. <b>The Last Musketeer</b> is a vintage sci-fi adventure with a unique twist from an internationally acclaimed cartoonist.</i></p><p>Jason's fourth full-color album may feature his loopiest premise yet.</p>",

It traces the artist''s evolution from a MAD-comics obsessed boy in Rego Park, Queens, to a neurotic adult examining the effect of his parents'' memories of Auschwitz on his own son.<br /><br /> The second part presents a facsimile of <em>Breakdowns</em>, the long-sought after collection of the artist''s comics of the 1970s, the book that triggers these memories. <em>Breakdowns</em> established the mode of formally sophisticated comics that transformed the medium, and includes the prototype of <em>Maus</em>, cubist experiments, an essay on humor, and the definitive genre-twisting pulp story \"Ace Hole-Midget Detective.\"<br /><br /> Pulling all this together is an illustrated essay that looks back at the sixties as the artist pushes sixty, and explains the obsessions that brought these works into being. Poignant, funny, complex, and innovative, <em>Breakdowns</em> alters the terms of what can be accomplished in a memoir</i>",

In the glittering ballrooms where the privileged gather, he moves with cool elegance. But in the desolate alleys where the undead feed, he preys with murderous intent. Immortality is his, but love never will be–only an eternity of loneliness, filled with the blood of innocent victims.</i></p><p><i>But Jenny won’t be one of them. Something about this beautiful young woman stirs feelings in Giancarlo that he hasn’t known for centuries. For her, he will defy his dark brethren and fight to be mortal again. But he is a marked man. Ghoulish murders plaguing the city have made him the target of a relentless homicide cop. And a far more dangerous enemy–one of unspeakable brutality and bloodlust–hovers even closer...determined to annihilate Giancarlo and his last chance for salvation.</i></p>",

Creature Feature is your chance to relive your youth or visit a joyous time of cinematic insanity done right for the first time. Welcome back to the 70s and 80s because the first Triple and a half Creature Feature of the new millennium is set to begin! This issue features three and a half scintillating tales of monsterous horror done right - over the top and gratuitous with a super-cool soundtrack. (Readers are responsible for providing their own tunes.) Grab a date, leave the kids at home, and stuff as many friends in your trunk as possible for out of this world terror in Abducted by Chris Yost, hot girls and feathery friends in Hooters by CB Cebulski, creepy crawlies in Why Did It Have To Be Spiders? by Andy Schmidt, and the first half of the rocktacular Rockenstein by Brian Smith, a tale so demented the drive-in is only willing to screen the first half of it lest they get shut down altogether for public indecency! </i>",

            "description": "<p><i>Ghost Talker's Daydream is a horror anime created by Saki Okuse and Sankichi Meguro. It tells the story of Misaki Saiki, a young woman with a troubled past, who is a professional dominatrix in one of Tokyo's most exclusive S&amp;M clubs. However, her real money is something she likes even less than being a dominatrix. Ever since childhood, Misaki has had the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, and that talent is put to use by the Livelihood Protection Agency, who pairs Misaki with Souichiro Kadotake, a martial artist who happens to be deathly afraid of ghosts. Using her gifts, Misaki is able to help troubled departed spirits resolve what is troubling them and allow them to move on to the afterlife. If all THAT isn't odd enough, Misaki is an albino AND a virgin.</i></p>",

All the stories  here have been recoloured or relettered to show them at their best.  Long before he discovered the Apple Mac, Hughes was collaborating with  Eisner Award-winner Grant Morrison on the classic British character Dan  Dare, producing a post-modern classic which sets an ageing, retired Dare  against a modern British landscape he no longer understands. Versatile  and unpredictable, Hughes makes full use of his clean graphic style on  The Science Service, written by John Freeman, and a looser, moody noir  palette on Raymond Chandler's Goldfish, here adapted by writer Tom  DeHaven. Really &amp; Truly, another Morrison collaboration, is a  high-octane psychedelic road-trip torn from the pages of cult comic  2000AD. As well as sketchbook pages, merchandise and rare strips - many  never seen before or out of print for over a decade - the book features  an introduction by comics guru Paul Gravett.</i></p>",

In fact, this book showcases three distinct styles: his earliest \"realistic\" drawing style (used to unsettling effect in some particularly creepy stories), an intermediate \"bighead\" cartoony style that still features humans (used for both humor and drama), and the \"funny-animal\" style he's now best known for.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The controversial cartoonist Rory Hayes was a self-taught dynamo of the underground comics revolution. Attracting equal parts derision and praise (the latter from the likes of R. Crumb and Bill Griffith), Hayes emerged as comics’ great primitive, drawing horror comics in a genuinely horrifying and hallucinatory manner (some have called him the Fletcher Hanks of the underground). He has influenced a generation of cartoonists, from <b>RAW</b> to Fort Thunder and back again.</i></p><p><i>This book, the first retrospective of Hayes’ career ever published, features the best of his underground comics output alongside paintings, covers, and artifacts rarely seen by human eyes — as well as astounding, previously unprinted comics from his teenage years and movie posters for his numerous homemade films. <b>The Art and Comix of Rory Hayes</b> also serves as a biography and critique with a memoir of growing up with Rory by his brother, the illustrator Geoffrey Hayes, and a career-spanning essay by Edwin Pouncey (a.k.a. Savage Pencil). Also included is a rare interview with Hayes himself.</i></p>",

This is the first comics adaptation of his popular story \"The Facts in the Case of the Departure of Miss Finch,\" which saw print only in the U.K. edition of Gaiman's award-winning work <b>Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions</b> and was recently interpreted for his <b>Speaking in Tongues</b> CD. <b>The Facts in the Case of the Departure of Miss Finch</b> is a \"mostly true story\" that combines the author's trademark magic realism with Zulli's sumptuous paintings, and has been newly rewritten for this hardcover. Join a group of friends, with the stern Miss Finch in tow, as they enter musty caverns for a subterranean circus spectacle called \"The Theatre of Night's Dreaming.\" Come inside, get out of the pounding rain, and witness this strange world of vampires, ringmasters, illusions, and the Cabinet of Wishes Fulfill'd.</i></p>",

A girl grown in a lab from the finest genetic material, she has been trained since her birth fifteen years ago to be the U.S. government’s ultimate espionage weapon. But now she is given an assignment that will test her abilities to the utmost — high school.</i></p><p><i>In order to uncover an evil plot, the government sends Luna to a prominent high school to pose as a student. Luna’s training has left her completely unprepared to handle the stresses and strains of ordinary teenage relationships — making friends, creating rivals, and having her first big crush on bad boy Jonah, the son of her arch-nemesis, Count Von Brucken! Making matters worse, Luna’s \"father\" is the overly warm-and-fuzzy Dr. Andy and her \"mother\" is the always business-like, unemotional Control.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em><strong>Fuzz &amp; Pluck: Splitsville</strong> tells the hilariously bizarre adventures of Pluck, an irritable and featherless rooster, and his best pal, the awkwardly unsocialized but lovable teddy bear known as Fuzz. These two usually inseparable and co-dependent misfits find themselves suddenly separated and alone. Pluck vows to establish his place in the world's pecking order by becoming a champion gladiator, while the more demure Fuzz finds himself a POW in a stuffed animal collection, only to escape and befriend a mercurial ferryman who recruits him for an impossible task. These absurdities pile on and eventually converge in a fatal collision course that reunites our heroes.</em></p><p><em><strong>Fuzz &amp; Pluck</strong> is an odd, and unusually original graphic novel, a \"funny animal\" comic that is surprisingly human. Rich with pathos, wit, farce, existentialism and drama, often cruel, always funny, this superficially ridiculous struggle for survival is an <strong>Alice in Wonderland</strong> for grown-ups that reaches absurdly delightful heights. As <strong>Simpsons</strong> creator Matt Groening says, \"This epic tale of a hapless li'l bear and his defeathered friend is why I love comics. All hail the peculiar Fuzz &amp; Pluck and their creator, Ted Stearn!\"</em></p><p><em>Ted Stearn is longtime storyboard artist for animation. <strong>Fuzz &amp; Pluck</strong> is the author's most personal work, showcasing his vivid imagination and meticulous draughtsmanship.</em></p>",

He clearly fashions himself a genius, writing with a faux-aristocratic air, and it is presumably his belief in his own genius that leads him to want to share his knowledge with the world. Each page features information such as \"It hardly needs mentioning that riding a pony is no intellectual triumph.... If riding a pony is so fantastic, why have I never read of any renowned pony-riding genius? It is because such a person does not exist, making it a foolish waste of time unworthy of attention.\" These pearls of wisdom are lettered in an elegant, almost obsessive fashion, entirely hand-crafted and bedecked with Ionic columns and fleurs-de-lis.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Harvey Kurtzman changed the face of American humor when he created the legendary <strong>MAD</strong> comic. As editor and chief writer from its inception in 1952, through its transformation into a slick magazine, and until he left <strong>MAD</strong> in 1956, he influenced an entire generation of cartoonists, comedians, and filmmakers. In 1962, he co-created the long-running <strong>Little Annie Fanny</strong> with his long-time artistic partner Will Elder for <strong>Playboy</strong>, which he continued to produce until his virtual retirement in 1988.</em></p><p><em>Between <strong>MAD</strong> and <strong>Annie Fanny</strong>, Kurtzman’s biographical summaries will note that he created and edited three other magazines, <strong>Trump</strong>, <strong>Humbug</strong>, and <strong>Help!</strong>, but, whereas his <strong>MAD</strong> and <strong>Annie Fanny</strong> are readily available in reprint form, his major satirical work in the interim period is virtually unknown. <strong>Humbug</strong>, which had poor distribution, may be the least known, but to those who treasure the rare original copies, it equals or even exceeds <strong>MAD</strong> in displaying Kurtzman’s creative genius. <strong>Humbug</strong> was unique in that it was actually published by the artists who created it: Kurtzman and his cohorts from <strong>MAD</strong> Will Elder, Jack Davis, and Al Jaffee, were joined by universally acclaimed cartoonist Arnold Roth. With no publisher above them to rein them in, this little band of creators produced some of the most trenchant and engaging satire of American culture ever to appear on American newsstands. At last, the entire run of 11 issues of <strong>Humbug</strong> is being reprinted in a deluxe format, much of it reproduced from the original art, allowing even owners of the original cheaply-printed issues to experience the full impact for the first time.</em></p>",

Bursting with full-color drawings, comics, and collages, autobiographical sections and gentle creative guidance, each page is an invigorating example of exactly what it is: \"The ordinary is extraordinary.\" Lynda Barry explores the depths of the inner and outer realms of creation and imagination, where play can be serious, monsters have purpose, and not knowing is an answer unto itself. How do objects summon memories? What do real images feel like? These types of questions permeate the pages of What It Is, with words attracting pictures and conjuring places through a pen that first and foremost keeps on moving.</em></p><p><em>Her insight and sincerity will tackle the most persistent of inhibitions, calling back every kid who quit drawing to again feel alive at the experiential level. Comprised of completely new material, this is her first Drawn &amp; Quarterly book.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Nominated for 2 Eisner Awards for best web comic, winner of an Expozine award, and hailed by Salon.com and the Montreal Mirror, Matthew Forsythe's Ojingogo is already highly anticipated. Exuding simplicity in design and narrative, Ojingogo is an illustrated, 'Jim Woodring-esque' dreamscape of abstracts and events. The otherworldly pantomime about a girl, her squid, and the creatures and calamities they experience together, is an intrinsically expressive and deeply rewarding journey. Drawing from Forsythe's Korean influences, Ojingogo is accessible for all ages, tossing aside traditional narrative conventions in favour of creating its own world, language and rules that anyone can find a home of their own in.</em></p>",

Like a Lynchian take on Alice in Wonderland, Jessica Farm opens with an exterior of what could be any Midwestern farmhouse: once inside, we track our titular heroine as she bounds out of bed on Christmas and goes about her morning routine, eventually breakfasting with her grandparents. The banality of the situation is subverted by a ratcheting sense of dread, however, as we discover that Jessica's increasingly nightmarish house is filled with creatures around every corner: some whimsical, some sexual, some despairing and some malevolent. Jessica Farmis an ambitious experiment in world-building: as conceived by Simmons, this book is the first volume of a life-spanning comics project in which he drew one page every month for the past seven years, starting in January 2000 — and will continue this project for 50 years in total, making up the story as he goes and releasing 96-page increments every 8 years until he amasses a 600-page body of work.</em></p>",

This is a \"snapshot\" of Houdini's life, centering on one of his most famous jumps. As Houdini prepares for a death-defying leap into the icy Charles River in Boston, biographer Jason Lutes and artist Nick Bertozzi reveal Houdini's life and influence: from the anti-Semitism Houdini fought all his life, to the adulation of the American public; from his hounding by the press, to his loving relationship with his wife Bess; from his egoism to his insecurity; from his public persona -- to the secret behind his most amazing trick! And it's all in graphic form, so it's fresh, original, and unlike anything previously published about this most fascinating of American showmen.</em></p>",

Who are these people? We all know about the one who shot his hunting partner in the face, but how about the tavern owner who once married one of his slaves and then sold her at auction when she tried to leave him? Or the one whose President went to his death regretting that he hadn't had his Vice President hanged? Or the one who was too frequently inebriated to serve out the whole of his term? Over more than 200 years, the American voters have sent a platoon of rogues, cowards, drunks, featherweights, doddering geriatrics, bigots, and atrocious spellers to Washington D.C. to sit one bullet, cerebral hemorrhage, or case of pneumonia away from the highest office in the land. Veeps tells the sordid, head-scratching, perversely-entertaining stories of these men we've chosen to ride shotgun in the biggest rig in democracy, without ever seriously considering the possibility that they might have to take the wheel.</em></p>",

Once the Christians have floated bodily into the sky, life goes on pretty much as usual for the immoral majority... except that magic works, if you're willing to risk demonic mutations. CNN reports that Mr. Christ and Mr. Bush are on a speaking tour of the red states. And an angelic army appears to have been deployed to mop up the sinners. But through it all, outsiders Raven and Mummy face the possibility of a bigger problem than the end of the world: the end of their relationship.</em></p><p><em>In the tradition of The Book of Revelations, Therefore Repent!, courtesy of novelist Jim Munroe (Flyboy Action Figure Comes With Gasmask) and acclaimed artist Salgood Sam (Sea of Red) is a lurid, dark fantasy tale. By taking the apocryphal scripture as literal truth — as the American powers-that-be claim to do — the story also explores the political and spiritual ramifications of God abandoning humanity.</em></p>",

Rue Silver's mother has disappeared . . . and her father has been arrested, suspected of killing her. But it's not as straightforward as that. Because Rue is a faerie, like her mother was. And her father didn't kill her mother -- instead, he broke a promise to Rue's faerie king grandfather, which caused Rue's mother to be flung back to the faerie world. Now Rue must go to save her -- and must also defeat a dark faerie that threatens our very mortal world.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Our journey begins on the title page, as two Victorian children and pet gazelle slip away from their father, treasure map in hand, and embark on an alphabetical path through a sewer populated with every sort of ghoul, only to emerge safe at home at the end. Following the “A is for … ” format, Gaiman’s text takes the form of 13 tight, evocative rhyming couplets, hand-lettered by Grimly. Page turns divide each couplet, moving the action forward and building the sense of mystery. The illustrations do double duty, telling the children’s story and filling each letter’s page with suitably ghastly, nominal matter. There’s some disturbing stuff on display (the sewer walls are lined with children bound in chains, straitjackets, and rusty manacles), but the character of the pictures, spiky and knobby and childlike, and a palette of beiges, accented by muted pastels, mitigates the creepiness. In the end, Gaiman and Grimly have combined forces to produce an acrid, gothic confection that bubbles with vitriol and wit.</em></p>",

Now, the sadistic sorcerer makes a play for power that will once again bring these two famous heroes together - but will it be as friends or foes? Writer Michael Avon Oeming (OMEGA FLIGHT, Red Sonja) and Mel Rubi (Red Sonja) - plus cover artist Michael Turner (CIVIL WAR) - answer the eternal question: What's better in a fight, the proportional strength and speed of a spider, or cold, hard steel and a chain-mail bikini?

They're just ordinary exchange students from a far-off land, here to learn about our culture - except their home is a mysterious city on the moon, and they each possess fabulous, exotic abilities and appearances. The product of experiments on humanity by an alien culture millennia ago, the Inhumans are a race governed by the laws of genetics. Here as nowhere else, diversity and individuality are prized beyond compare. The Inhumans have flourished in isolation from humanity within their kingdom of Attilan on the surface of the moon, but what happens when their king decides to send some of his subjects to Earth to learn about humans? Will they be able to integrate into human culture? More important, will they even try?</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>IDW's Star Trek: Second Stage continues, as comics icon John Byrne unveils the first-ever Star Trek series of his decades-spanning career! The 1968 TV episode \"Assignment Earth\" had been the Season Two finale for the original Star Trek series, and was intended by Gene Roddenberry as the pilot for a spin-off series that never came to pass. Now, Byrne delivers the series 40 years after it would have debuted, recounting the adventures of interstellar agent Gary Seven and his Earth-born assistant as they covertly confront threats to the past so that they can save Star Trek's future. Byrne writes and draws the series, which steps one year forward with each installment, beginning with 1968, the year that the spin-off series would have appeared.</em></p>",

When a classmate's boyfriend kills himself because he was rumoured to be gay, the school goes into mourning overdrive, each clique trying to find something to hold on to and something to believe in. It's a weird time to fall in love, but that's high school, and that's what happens to Skim when she starts to meet in secret with her neo-hippie English teacher, Ms. Archer. But when Ms. Archer abruptly leaves, Skim struggles to cope with her confusion and isolation, armed with her trusty journal and a desire to shed old friendships while cautiously approaching new ones.</em></p><p><em>Depression, love, sexual identity, crushes, manipulative peers --teen life in all its dramatic complexities is explored in this touching, pitch-perfect, literary graphic masterpiece.

            "description": "<p><em>Love Harvey Kurtzman's original MAD? Then you will have to have Ross Andru and Mike Esposito's historic satire and parody magazine, Get Lost. Originally released in 1953, Get Lost delivered three groundbreaking, laugh-filled issues before Bill Gaines sued the magazine's distributor, shutting down production of the magazine. Even though Gaines lost the lawsuit, Andru and Esposito never produced more Get Lost. Hermes Press' historic reprint collects all three issues of the magazine on heavy coated matte paper together with an introductory essay by noted pop-culture historian Ron Goulart, an interview with Mike Esposito, and tons of documentary material in one volume. For this archival edition Hermes Press has painstakingly reconstructed Get Lost's artwork using the original black-and-white line art and recoloring it from scratch. Mike Esposito says it \"looks better than the original.\" MAD's most noteworthy competitor is a treasure to behold for fans of Alfred E. Newman as well as comic book collectors, fans, and anyone looking for a good laugh.</em></p>",

This is the world of New York City in the Roaring Twenties. Known for its sinister and treacherous underworld, there's a new power waking up the city that never sleeps. His name... John \"The Hand\" Smith. An outcast and an orphan, Smith has a massive right hand nearly twice as large as his left, and when push comes to shove, you'd pity anyone that gets in its way. When a rumble at the docks lands Smith on the local mob boss's payroll, it could be the break he's been waiting for. Along with his quick-witted best friend Bootsy and the martial arts femme fatale Ring-A-Ling, Smith and his crew are taking a big bite outta the Big Apple. But with the gangs wanting him dead and the boss's girl wanting him in her bed, has Smith bitten off more than he can chew? Read the acclaimed comic book series of which Variety writes: \"If you like Martin Scorsese's films, this is the comic for you.\"</em></p><p><em>Created by filmmaker and actor Edward Burns (Saving Private Ryan, Brothers McMullen, 27 Dresses).</em></p><p><em>Collects Ed Burns: Dock Walloper #1-5</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>This fourth installment in Michel Rabagliati's semi-autobiographical series finds Paul settling comfortably into adult life, occasional twinges of anxiety aside. His graphic design business has taken off, his partner Lucie is pregnant, it's mid-July and time to leave behind the city to go fishing. Long lazy days stretch out while Paul's thoughts wander from the colorful characters at the fish-and-game camp to the lurking depths of childhood, a Holden Caulfield-esque adolescence, and the encounters that have shaped his sense of family thus far. But the golden glow soon lifts off his vacation, with the realization that the lake isn't as idyllic as it would seem, and neither is pregnancy.</em></p><p><em>Elegant composition and spare, condensed drawing crystallize emotion and atmosphere in this wistful and engaging account of everyday hopes and hardships, told with a keen and playful sense of iconic detail. Even the mundane holds beauty and meaning in this compassionate story of expectation, disappointment and wonder.</em></p>",

The ancient world is embroiled in a mighty clash of armies: Greek vs. Trojan. Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, has betrayed her husband - the Greek, Menelaus - and fled to Troy with Trojan prince, Paris. The Greeks have sailed to Troy to bring her back - and crush all that stand in their way. This is the first chapter in the saga that virtually defines the word epic. It is a tale of gods and men, heroism and betrayal. From the lips of Homer to the pages of Marvel Illustrated.</em></p><p><em>Collecting MARVEL ILLUSTRATED: THE ILIAD #1-8.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The <strong>Star Wars</strong> saga continues! <strong>The Force Unleashed: Art of the Game</strong> chronicles the four-year development of the anxiously awaited, action-packed video game (releasing April 2008) developed by LucasArts from conception to completion. The book reveals innovative game design concept and images, three-dimensional renders, and behind-the-scenes photos. <strong>The Force Unleashed</strong> game casts players as Darth Vader's \"Secret Apprentice\" and promises to unveil new revelations about the <strong>Star Wars</strong> galaxy. The expansive story, created under direction from George Lucas, is set during the unexplored era between <strong>Star Wars</strong> Episode III: <strong>Revenge of the Sith</strong> and<strong> Star Wars</strong> Episode IV: <strong>A New Hope</strong>. The game re-imagines the scope and scale of the Force by taking full advantage of new technologies that will be seen and experienced for the first time, such as Digital Molecular Matter (DMM) by Pixelux Entertainment and euphoria by NaturalMotion Ltd., paired with the powerful Havok Physics (TM) system. These new technologies create gameplay only possible on the new generation of consiles. DMM incorporates the physical properties of objects in the environment so that every element reacts exactly as it should--wood breaks like wood, glass shatters like glass, Felucian plants bend in their unique way, and more. Meanwhile, as a revolutionary behavioral-simulation engine, euphoria enables interactive characters to move, act, and even think like actual human beings, adapting their behavior and resulting in a different response every single time. Well before its release, <strong>The Force Unleashed</strong> game is already buzzing on blogs and gamer websites, at gamer conferences, and among <strong>Star Wars</strong> fans. LucasArts is fully backing the promotion of the game to the tens of millions of <strong>Star Wars</strong> fans around the world.</em></p>",

Spurred on by Lady Macbeth, his wife, he embarks on a killing spree of former friends and rivals, until a final confrontation when he realizes too late that the witches have deceived him. In this version of Shakespeare's tale of murder and the supernatural, samurai warriors have reclaimed a future post-nuclear world of mutants. Macbeth is part of Manga Shakespeare, a series of graphic novel adaptations of William Shakespeare's plays. Drawing inspiration from trend-setting Japan and using Shakespeare's original texts, this series – adapted by Richard Appignanesi and illustrated by leading manga artists – brings to life the great Bard's words for students, Shakespeare enthusiasts and manga fans.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is probably the most original murder mystery ever written. It is also one of the first. Set in the oppressive summer of a St Petersburg heatwave, this is the story of Raskolnikov, an impoverished student who brutally murders a miserly old pawnbroker simply because he can. And so we enter the delirious mind and world of a killer – an intellectual misfit, alienated from his family and friends, cut off from a corrupt society \"as if with scissors\", and tormented by a \"Great Idea\" that turns into a cat-and-mouse nightmare with the police. Boldly and vividly updated by adaptor David Zane Mairowitz and artist Alain Korkos to a modern St Petersburg peopled by the grotesques of the 'Gas-Putin' generation, this upside-down whodunit traces the path of a man above suspicion who ends up informing on himself. But can he find redemption? When Robert Louis Stevenson finished reading Crime and Punishment, he said the experience was \"like having an illness\"; then he started writing a new story about a Scottish doctor called Jekyll…</em></p>",
