As he asks for Captain Marvel to take his powers, Black Adam and Isis arrive.</p><p>Osiris blames Black Adam for Kahndaq's suffering and punches him.

His face is almost unrecognizable with his eye socket hanging out and face completely cut open along with his severed right arm and mutilated groan. He is awoken when his zombified daughter is about to be killed by his goons, and stops them just before passing out. Since the doc and Alice are now gone, their only hope to patch him up is the town drunk Bob, who was once a medic in the army. A week later The Governor finally wakes up from his pain induced coma to find that not only did Alice and the Doc escape with Martinez, but that Martinez himself, who was secretly sent to help the survivors escape so that he could find the location of the prison and return with the info, is now dead. With this information and Martinez's decapitated head, The Governor forms a meeting with the town and convinces the citizens of Woodbury that Rick and his group of survivors are dangerous murderers who killed Martinez and tortured The Governor, simply because they were savages. He also convinces them out of fear that it would be unwise not to attack the prison survivors before they themselves are attacked which the Woodbury citizens angrily agree to. The next day The Governor and his men find some of their soldiers shot and killed outside of a deserted gas station , with Bruce barely alive to inform them that it was indeed the prison survivors who attacked them. The Governor shoots Bruce in the head and realizes that his shooting hand, which is his right hand, is now gone. Now furious, The Governor orders his men to find the tracks of the outsiders and follow them. Gabe and another survivor are able to locate the prison and return to inform The Governor of the news, which The Governor reveals a plan to attack them when their defense are down again. Mean while back at the prison, Andrea is teaching a couple of the survivors how to fire properly with a rifle. When the weeks pass, The Governor arrives at the prison with his large fleet, that consists of a large number of vehicles filled with armed soldiers and a large tank, which he is on top of. He points angrily at the prison and screams \"Kill them all!\".</p>",

Hellion slams him telekinetically into the ceiling, and then checks on Surge. David hits him in the face, back and face, and then tells him that he hit him with three parts of the human body that are essentially unbreakable, and he better go see Elixir about his injuries. David leaves and tells Surge that they're through.</p> <p>On the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-54190\" href=\"/astral-plane/4020-54190/\" slug=\"astral-plane\">Astral Plane</a>, the Astonishing team share they're thoughts about the students, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\" href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" slug=\"kitty-pryde\">Shadowcat </a>saying that she's worried about Elixir.</p> <p>Back with the group, as everyone sleeps, we see <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40672\" href=\"/loa/4005-40672/\" slug=\"loa\">Loa </a>getting up. We see Dust, X-23 and Mercury having some sort of a slumber party, and Surge's room trashed, while David looks out a window.</p> <p>Loa goes to Elixir's room, and tells him that she's been thinking, and asks him if he wants to make-out. Elixir's skin suddenly turns gold again, and he says \"Sure?\"</p> <p>Cyclops tells the New X-Men that they might be the last generation of X-Men, and that if the X-Men are not there, Prodigy will fill in as a substitute teacher. He asks Surge if this is okay, and she says fine.</p> <p>Predator X is approaching the Institute, but turns and head somewhere else. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47984\" href=\"/matthew-risman/4005-47984/\" slug=\"matthew-risman\">Matthew Risman </a>shouts at the screen, but a Purifier tells him that maybe it's found a new target. Risman realises what this means, and tells the Purifiers that they have much more to do.</p> <p>There's a pin-up in the back of the issue to fill in for the missing <a data-ref-id=\"4045-43950\" href=\"/endangered-species/4045-43950/\" slug=\"endangered-species\">Endangered Species </a>tie-in. It was a pin-up by Bryan Hitch of Mercury, X-23 and Surge.</p>",
