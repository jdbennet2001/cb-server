            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Peter begins to follow the threads that could lead to his greatest nemesis. But that pales next to the shocking development of Flash Thompson, the fastest jock alive, going on a date with the mysterious and menacing Miss Arrow. A date that will lead to them all to the most shocking destination of all: A local bowling alley!</p><p>In a church, Miss Arrow, the school nurse at Midtown High, is talking to a shadowy figure of a huge spider.  It calls her Ero and reminds her that she must reproduce if she wants to survive.  She tells it that she's already decided on a host, Flash Thompson.  She says by this time tomorrow, he'll be her mate, then her sustenance.</p><p>Outside Aunt May's hospital room, where Mary Jane and an officer are, Spider-Man looks in.  He questions his recent actions of revealing his identity and blames himself for her condition.  He doesn't understand why he tries to always do the right thing but his loved ones always end up sufferring.<br /></p><p>Later at the apartment of Flash Thompson, Betty knocks on the door.  Peter answers in his Ben Reilly guise.  She recognizes from the bookstore at Deb Whitman's signing.  She also noticed that he disappeared when Spider-Man arrived to fight the Vulture.  She pushes her way in and Peter tries telling her that it's an illegal entry.  He slips and calls her by name when she hasn't introduced herself to him.  She asks him why would Flash have a picture of Ben, May, and little Peter Parker in his apartment.  Peter tries acting like he doesn't know as Betty starts crying.  She knows it's him.  She's sad for everything he's going through and with what happened to Aunt May.  She hugs him and tells him she's missed him.</p><p>Flash is getting a ride from a friend, Kelly \"Double K\" Kulick, that works at a garage (where he took his smashed up car from last issue).  He asks her to drop him off at the bowling alley.  He coaches the high school team and has set her up to join him.  Apparently she's a really good bowler and he wants her to knock down the kids' egos.  Reluctantly, she agrees.  As they walk inside, Miss Arrow is watching from above and is not too happy that he is with another female.</p><p>Peter and Betty talk.  He's surprised that she's not mad at him for \"lying\" to her all these years.  She says she just thinks how lonely he must have been keeping everything to himself.  She also says because in a way, she's never stopped loving him.  She then changes the subject to Nurse Arrow.  Peter tells her that maybe she isn't crazy when it comes to her.  He's begun to have his own suspicions.  He mentions all the spiders when he and Sandman discovered the principal was dead.  He also mentions a time when he and Flash were in his office.  She came in suddenly and he had to quickly hit his image inducer to change into Ben.  His spider-sense should have gone off but it didn't.  She was there to talk to Flash.  She said after seeing him with Betty, she was jealous and wanted to go out with him.  Betty tries looking online to see if there's any information about her such as being a spider trainer or something.  Peter says to do a search for \"Arrow\" and \"spider.\"  The \"goggle\" search engine gives the suggestion of \"spider\" \"ero\" which makes Peter remember when he was in Stark Tower.  After he lost his old body, pirate spiders of the Ero genus came and ate his skin.</p><p>At the bowling alley, Miss Arrow surprises Flash.  When Flash introduces her to his friend, Arrow greets her coldly.  She tells Flash she's ready to go much to Kelly's surprise.  Flash says he can't just leave his team but Arrow insists.  She even pushes Kelly over.  Arrow is becoming desparate now.  She grabs Flash by the neck and slams him against the wall saying she's going to give him the time of his life as sweat begins pouring off her face.<br /></p><p>Kelly comes from behind and hits Arrow in the shoulder with a bowling pin.  Everyone is surprised to see that the blow has revealed a swarm of spiders.  Arrow responds by spitting out even more from her mouth at Kelly.  Spider-Man arrives to knock Arrow away.  He tells everyone to leave and tries to spin a web at her.  She changes into a bunch of spiders and is able to escape.<br /></p><p>Outside in Kelly's tow truck, she and Flash are about to leave when they are lifted in the air by even more spiders.  Flash yells at Arrow to let Kelly go because she is not involved in this.  Arrow agrees and throws her out of the truck.  Spider-Man is able to catch and save her.  After setting her down, he heads towards the spiders saying she's not going to get away with him but it's too late.  Flash is already gone with her.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i> </i><i>Overview:<br /><br /></i>X-Factor deals with the fallout of the X-Cell explosion! <br />X-Factor reels as they try and piece their lives back together <br />as new relationships are forged and old ones crumble apart. Don’t miss this turning point issue! <br /><br /><b> </b><b>Issue Summary:</b><br /><br />Marveling at her outstretched arm, Fatale smiles that this… this is fantastic. Even her <i>arm</i> is healed! Nearby, Abyss uncoils his arms, as he had done so many times before he lost his powers. The Brimstone Dimension, he exclaims, he can feel it in every part of his body again! Agreeing, Reaper cautiously asks Abyss to keep <i>his</i> parts away from his parts. </p> <p>From behind the couch, Pietro leans over to the ear of Rictor, who is leaning back in the couch in apparent exhaustion. Calling him back to the here and now, he asks Rictor if he is all right and if he can keep going. Turning to Pietro, Rictor asks why… doesn’t he feel the Earth yet? He… he <i>almost</i> can… Like it’s <i>just</i> out of reach. Why? Because, Pietro replies, he’s still acting as a siphon, so his power is investing him incrementally, rather than all at once.  </p><p>When Pietro then suggests they continue, he notices that Rictor has lost consciousness. He then suggests to the others that they wait for a bit for him to recover. Then, he tells Marrow, they can move on to her… Interrupting, Callisto says no, even when he comes to. No. Sighing, Pietro asks Callisto when is she going to put aside her hatred? Her distrust? About ten minutes after she dies, she replies.  </p><p>Turning to Marrow, Callisto places her hands on her shoulders, pleading with her not to do it. It’s too easy. Marrow begins to protest, but Callisto presses, begging her. If she ever listened to her about anything, listen to this: <i>Pietro</i> isn’t the answer. She then asks her at least to wait to see if the powers stick with the others. Wait to see them in action. And how long should that be? Marrow asks back. Her question goes unanswered, as the ground begins to shake. She immediately asks if it is Rictor, but Pietro says that it is not. He’s still out. Perhaps a subliminal… Another theory is announced with a <i>Holy crap</i> by Elijah Cross, who stares wide-eyed out of the window. Asked what it is, Elijah asks if they know that movie – “<b>300</b>?” When he answers yeah, he says that it’s kinda like that.  </p><p>Out in the street, Elijah sees a horde of men marching toward their hideout. In truth, it is an army, comprised of Madrox duplicates. Each dupe bears a metal shield, with the letter “M.” Eyeing these from the window, Fatale asks if they are… They are! They’re <i>garbage can</i> lids. Still amazed by the site, Elijah remarks that he would have thought they’d be on their side, that they’d give a damn about the government trying to destroy their race. Guess he was wrong. That said, he calls upon Reaper… Abyss… Fatale… “Let’s <i>take</i> ‘em.”  </p><p>Seeing their foes approaching, the dupes all brandish their “shields” in a defensive position. Among their number is the prime Jamie Madrox, who marvels at this rare moment of unity among his dupes. Nothing focuses them like death, and these guys poisoned one of his dupes. That, and they could have <i>killed</i> Theresa. That demands payback.  </p><p>As the X-Cell approaches, Madrox tells his dupe to be ready. When the dupe replies that he was born ready, his progenitor reminds him that he was born about ninety-seconds ago. Whatever, he replies. At the head of the X-Cell, Elijah Cross yells to Madrox that he brought this on <i>himself</i>. They could have been friends. To this, Monet appears in the air above the army of Madri, rejoining that they’ve got <i>enough</i> friends.  </p><p>Joining her is Rahne, not in her half-wolf form but in full body of a wolf, fangs bared. As she engages Reaper, Madrox silently notes that Rahne isn’t exactly a happy camper. She got dumped down a sewer and came back to headquarters reeking of sewage, demanding a shower and swearing revenge. As she sidesteps Reaper’s blades and then sinks her fangs into his throat, he notes that she never takes on her full wolf-form, as she doesn’t like what it does to her. But, from her actions this time… she doesn’t seem to care.  </p><p>Back in the clinic, Pietro watches the battle below. Foolishness, he opines. Such foolishness. What do they hope to accomplish by this? “A distraction,” answers Layla, appearing much to the group’s surprise. “So I could basically walk in the back door.”  </p><p>Regarding the young girl, Callisto asks who this is, to which Pietro answers, adding that she professes to “know things.” <i>Stuff</i>, Layla corrects. She knows <i>stuff</i>. Don’t mangle her catch-phrase. Smirking slightly, Marrow asks back what kind of “stuff” does she know? In response, Layla states that she knows the government didn’t take their powers away. Pietro knows it too, she adds. He’s just using them because he’s… y’know… <i>evil</i>. And he thinks that all that matters is power.  </p><p>It is, Pietro replies, unapologetically. It is his gift… a gift he chooses to share with his bretheren. And she, Layla, for all her talk, remains – in person – a mere girl. Helpless. <i>Powerless</i>. Actually, she counters, she has the greatest power of all. Incredulous, Pietro inquires what <i>that</i> might be? Knowledge, she replies, producing a cassette recorder. And, like him, she explains, she’s willing to share.  </p><p>Pressing play, she explains that the first voice is Siryn, the second Quicksilver. “He may be a slimeball. He may be a totally evil monster,” Siryn says. “You know I can hear you, right?” follows Pietro’s voice. Siryn’s voice then say, “But he didn’t pretend to be our friend, and he didn’t lie to us. Can you say the same.” As Pietro stammers in horror, the next voice, Wolverine’s according to Layla, says, “Everybody lies. Get over it.” The next voice, according to Layla, is all Cyclops.  </p><p>Before Cyclops’ voice is heard, Pietro – three of them – lunge toward Layla, but all two are intercepted by Marrow, who tackles them, while Callisto kicks the third in the groin. “We couldn’t let people know the truth,” Cyclops says. “It would’ve caused a worldwide panic. If everyone knew that a single mutant could create the world in her own image… obliterate powers with a few words... humans would have wanted to destroy any remaining mutant…”  </p><p>As Cyclops finishes, another Quicksilver appears and gets close enough to the player to touch it, but is then waylaid by Marrow, who knife’s him in the shoulder. Grabbing his costume top with one hand while threatening him with the knife stained by his blood in the other, Marrow demands to know from Pietro who it <i>was</i>. Who’s the <i>she</i> responsible for this? Unfortunately for Marrow, the Quicksilver she was threatening disappears before her eyes.  </p><p>Seeing Marrow’s confusion, Layla explains that that was a <i>future</i> Quicksilver. The “current” one is the one that Callisto kicked in the privates. In answer to her question, she asks that Marrow think about it: what mutant “she” would Pietro be the <i>most</i> willing to <i>cover</i> for? Immediately guessing the answer from the clue, Marrow proclaims, “The Witch! The <i>Scarlet Witch</i>! She…” Before Callisto’s warning can do so, another Quicksilver appears behind Marrow, quickly grabbing her knife from her hands, shoves it through Marrow’s lower torso from behind, the point emerging right under her ribcage.  </p><p>Outside, Reaper is triumphant, tossing Rahne’s wolf-form aside. His reactivated neurotoxins in his skin have paralyzed her, he tells the others. And cutting her damned <i>head</i> off will stop her for good! However, before he can deal a killing stroke, Reaper is accosted by Guido, who grabs his arm in a vice grip. Telling him to “step aside,” Guido tosses Reaper into the air, announcing that he’s looking for the blork who chucked him into the East River. He’s got a complaint to register!  </p><p>Nearby, Elijah Cross barrels through the army of Madri, using his power of extra mass to become an unstoppable force. As he does so, Elijah calls Madrox a traitor. He and his whole crew! A <i>traitor</i> to mutantkind. The blow comes harder to Madrox than normally, he thinks, hvin pretty much hit his capacity for dupes, making Cross’ impacts not create any more. Now he knows how a rack of bowling pins feels.  </p><p>Standing alone amid a mass of “bowled” Madri, Elijah Cross revels. Arms wide, he proclaims that they’re the <i>good guys</i> there. That’s why people like Callisto and Marrow joined up! They should all be working together to build a future!  </p><p>Listening to the young Elijah preach his gospel, Madrox thinks how he makes it sound so positive. A <i>future</i>. Hard to know if mutants even have a future anymore. But all of that is secondary to the fact… that he could swear he smells something <i>burning</i>.  </p><p>Nearby, Monet sidesteps the ethereal tendrils of Abyss, making her way ever closer. Finally making it to within arm’s reach, he clocks him with a right cross, knocking him to the ground. Her target down, she asks where Rictor. Is he in there with Quicksilver?  </p><p>For an answer, Monet receives a blow which comes out of nowhere. Not able to see her new antagonist, Monet immediately surmises her identity. Telling her that that’s cute, real cute, she tells Fatale that that’s got to be her. Bending light so that she’s invisible. <i>Funny</i> thing… when you’re fighting a <i>telepath</i> with accelerated hearing… <i>invisibility</i> isn’t worth a <i>damn</i>! In demonstration, Monet kicks out, connecting squarely with the abdomen of Fatale, who involuntarily becomes visible once again.  </p><p>Before Monet can press her advantage, Abyss reenters the fray, his tendril this time wrapping around Monet’s arms and dragging her toward him. Dragging her ever closer, so powerfully that Monet’s boots make grooves in the asphalt, Abyss tells her that he’s almost sorry he has to do this. The Brimstone dimension is within him… it is nowhere she’ll want to spend time. If one she could have shared their vision… could have seen what is to come, as mutantkind achieves <i>greatness</i> once again… Interrupting his prognostication, three Madri appear and simultaneously ram their garbage can shields on Abyss. As they knock him out, one tells him to put a lid on it.  </p><p>It is at this point that the screaming starts, drawing everyone’s attention. It is followed by the smell… the aroma of burning flesh… becoming even more pronounced… It’s <i>Cross</i>. Having collapsed in pain, Elijah Cross’ body has begun to smoke from his hands, shoulder, eyes and mouth. He yells for someone to help him – and then curses Quicksilkver and Rictor, calling them traitors. He’ll kill them for this! He… He’ll…  </p><p>In mid-sentence, Elijah Cross explodes in fire and smoke, leaving nothing but an orange stain. Dumbfounded by this, Fatale asks what’s happening. She’s sweating… She feels so… so hot… When Monet asks her if she got her powers back the same way he did, she confirm, pleading for her to do something. Remarking that she will, Monet proceeds to put some distance between the two, explaining that she’s wearing a new shirt.  </p><p>Inside his clinic, Pietro tells Callisto that she’d best attend to Marrow, and quickly. She may not have long. Then turning his attention back to Layla, who he has in his grip and elevated off her feet, he tells her that this reckoning has been a long time coming. Then again, he supposes she knew that didn’t she? Kinda, she responds.  </p><p>Confusion suddenly fills Pietro, as he realizes aloud that Layla feels no pain from his touch, as Guido did. She’s not a mutant! Then… what <i>is</i> she? Scared, Layla replies. Happy now? No, he replies, but he <i>will</i> be when she…  </p><p>Pietro is interrupted by the now conscious Rictor, who tells him to drop her. <i>Now</i>. Rather than acting upset, Pietro is jubilant at Rictor’s return. Ignoring his instruction, he tells him that as soon as he attends to this little nuisance, they can… Interrupting again, Rictor tells him that he doesn’t stand by and let kids get killed. Not even kids that annoy the snot out of him. “Let her <i>go</i>,” he repeats.  </p><p>Layla begins to tell Rictor what Pietro is using him. Though Pietro tells her to be quiet, she continues. One of X-Cell just blew up. He should take a sniff if he doesn’t believee her… He can still smell the burned flesh in the air. The changes are still <i>unstable</i>… just like <i>him</i>. Incensed at her, Pietro once again threatens Layla, but again Rictor comes to her aid, this time pulling one Pietro’s arm and causing him to drop the young girl.  </p><p>Now turned to Rictor, Pietro locks hands with Rictor’s in a test of strength. Calling him an idiot, Pietro tells him that he has no idea what he’s doing… She <i>right</i>, Rictor interrupts. He used him! Used him to try and convince others to trust him, ‘cause word was getting around that he was dangerous! To this, Pietro says through gritted teeth that it’s hardly his fault if his lack of power also gives him a lack of vision.  </p><p>Ignoring him, Rictor counters that here’s the thing: he’s channeling those crystal of his though him… he can feel it… feel the power, rooting around in him… power to move the earth. And they… come <i>from</i> the earth. They’re all part of it… It’s in them… and if he can move the earth… He says it’s all about power? Fine… then… <i>More power to you!!!!</i> </p><p>In punctuation to Rictor’s comment, all of the Terrigen crystals, all embedded in Pietro’s body, suddenly fly free, erupting from his torso. Wide-eyed, Pietro yells first in abject agony, then again in frustration. His crystals! The Terrigen crystals! What has he done?! <i>What has he done?!?!</i> </p><p>A moment later, Wolsbane’s wolf form erupts through the window and immediately sets her eyes toward Pietro. Calling out to her, Layla tells her to forget about him. If she cares <i>anything</i> about Rictor… and she knows as well as she that she does… <i>way</i> more than she lets one… then she’ll help him now.  </p><p>Doing so, the wolf moves to Rictor’s prone body. Though having been knocked down by the ordeal, Rictor is still conscious and moves his hand along Rahne’s muzzle. He tells her to forget it… not… not worth saving… Powerless again… and such… such an <i>idiot</i>. But for a second there, he says, it felt good. Slowly transforming from wolf, to wolf-girl, then woman, Rahne tells Rictor to stop talking – save his strength. When Rictor states that he thinks he’s dying, she tells him it’s nonsense. <i>Nobody’s</i> dying…  </p><p>Outside, Madrox watches as Abyss, Fatale and Reaper begin to quake. They’re dying, he thinks. They’re dying and all he can think of is what Layla was saying, about how it would all self-destruct <i>without</i> their help.  </p><p>Realizing their fate, Abyss calls out to Fatale and Reaper, instructing them to go loose. As he wraps his tendrils around them, Fatale asks what he’s doing. The only thin he <i>can</i> do, he say sadly. A moment later, Abyss has dragged his two allies into the otherworldly dimension that his body lets him access. Madrox realizes his actions but can only wonder how that will help, whether it will freeze their status – cause their power to remain, or to be drained away or what, but he gets no opportunity to ask, as Abyss disappears into nothingness.  </p><p>Though victorious, Madrox silently notes that Val Cooper isn’t going to be thrilled about this. The X-Cell’s leader is dead… half their membership has vanished <i>literally</i> into nothingness. Callisto and Marrow likewise make a getaway, although not a clean one, having disappeared via the sewers. And as for Quicksilver, well… actually, they’ve no reason to turn him over. Considering he was responsible for Cross’ demise. They’d probably pin a medal on him.  </p><p>Limping his way to safety, Pietro possessively examines a spec of rock in his hand. One… one left… salvaged one… If… if there’s one… maybe he can…  </p><p>However, much to his dismay, the single spec of Terrigen crystal dies, a wisp of energy dissipating its energy. His anger is palpable and he voices his emotion trough gritted teeth. Composing himself once again, he continues on.  </p><p>Elsewhere, Madrox considers Pietro’s status. The whole thing with Quicksilver is that he can pull versions of himself from the future… bring them into the present. Of course… if something happens to one of those future selves in the present… then when Pietro “catches up” to that point in time… then this “past” is going to return to haunt him. Then again… he guesses that’s the whole thing with the future. Sometimes you catch up with it <i>sooner</i> than you think. </p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The battle lines have been drawn! Captain Britain's most powerful enemy has declared war and is building an army. An army that now consists of New Excalibur's first foes, the Dark X-Men!</em></p><p>In the recent past, Sage, in disguise as Diana Fox, was accepted by Albion to be one of his Shadow-Captains. It took days of proving herself, but she was finally part of his inner circle, so she was now close enough to take him down. First though, she had to figure out how.</p><p>Currently, in a hospital in London, Nocturne is still in recovery for her seizure. She’s having trouble reading and writing, but she continues to get better the more she practices. The same goes for more difficult tasks like juggling. She tries a few times and fails, but says she won’t give up until she gets it right.</p><p>In Crossmore, Britain’s ultimate security prison, Excalibur takes on Shadow-X. While punching out Cyclops and Jean Grey, Captain Britain notices that it looked like they were about to attack Lionheart. The rest of the team sticks to the typical battle talk and Wisdom complains about the “snappy patter.” Shadow-X’s Angel picks up Cyclops and the team leader shoots at Lionheart and Captain Britain. Things turn around and Shadow-X starts getting the upper hand in their fight with Excalibur, but it doesn’t last long. Dazzler takes down Angel and Cyclops who fall (to their deaths according to Jean) alongside an unconscious Captain Britain. While the fight goes on, Lionheart flees the battle, but feels guilty for abandoning the heroes to Shadow-X. As Excalibur recovers, Jean uses the last of her strength to throw Beast at the escaping Lionheart, but Juggernaut catches the mutant and holds him up as a shield when Iceman fires on him. Dazzler and Wisdom turn on Iceman and take him down with lights and hot knives while the rest of the Captain Britain gets back to his feet and wonders why it looked like Lionheart ran and why Shadow-X was about to attack her before the team had gotten there.</p><p>Elsewhere, Albion and his Shadow-Captains, including Sage, fly towards a secret base where her loyal to Albion would be put to the test. Once inside the base, Sage discovers that it was a place even she didn’t know about, and she makes a note to fix that problem. The base is guarded by British soldiers and tanks, but Albion’s amazing strength was enough to destroy most things with one punch of his fist or slash of his sword. However, he was still mortal and the troops stationed at the base were trained to take out super humans, so it was a good thing Albion had backup of his own. Sage protected Albion during the firefight and when the smoke cleared, Albion and his captains were applauding her. He tells her that he owes her his life, but he also says that he’s not sure if she was saving him or them. He tells her that she is clever, and while he is not, he <em>always</em> wins and that she should remember that. He then leads her to a room where he plans to show her how he’ll win the war ahead.</p><p>Leaving the Crossmore prison, Wisdom checks his palm pilot and sees what’s going on at the secret base.</p><p>At the hospital, Nocturne continues her treatment. She begins therapy on her legs by walking up stairs. After she wears herself out going up just once, the doctor asks her if she wants to quit, but she says she’ll give it another try.</p><p>Back at the base, Albion and Sage walk into a room filled with gold coins and items. Albion picks up a strange object while Sage wonders if she’s been found out and contemplates attacking Albion now, while they’re alone. Just then, Lionheart runs in, forcing Sage to wait. Lionheart tells her leader that Shadow-X betrayed them and had planned to use her body as a host for Shadow King, but fortunately she had killed him. Albion says that he’ll hear it all later, but right now, he is about to achieve victory. He opens the object he picked up, an ornate tube with something inside of it, and says that he and his few captains are up against the technological might of this age. Behind him, Sage decides that, whatever happens, Albion has to be stopped, but Lionheart sees her preparing to attack and moves to stop her. Before she can, they all hear helicopters in the distance. The helicopters fire missiles and while everyone else is paying attention to that, Albion takes out a glowing blade from the tube and stabs it into the ground and lifts it up. Sage reaches for Albion but touches the blade, and something happens to her and she appears to pass out in his arms. The light from the blade grows and seems to fill the room. Outside, the helicopters and their missiles fall harmlessly out of the sky. Across the city, lights go out and all technology stops working. Lionheart steps over Sage’s body, now on the ground, and asks Albion what he’s done. He says that his spell had robbed the world of all their technology and magic, reducing them to a simpler, more basic age.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Brian Reed (New Avengers Illuminati) and Aaron Lopresti (Incredible Hulk) bring the Puppet Master saga to an explosive conclusion! In the heart of South America, Ms. Marvel goes toe-to-toe with a giant as she tries to put an end to Puppet Master's final grab at glory – while facing the possibility of losing one of the people she cares most about in the world! Death, destruction and special guest star Stature of the Young Avengers, all in this issue! Dusk does not appear in this issue, with the implication being that she was sold off-panel by Puppet Master.</em></p><p>In Puerto Maravilla, Chile, Ms. Marvel finds herself captive of a semi-retired Phillip Masters AKA Puppet Master. He has crafted a puppet in her likeness, but its hold over her is brief. Again, Ms. Marvel experiences an inexplicable reboot – turning blue and breaking Masters' control over her mind and body.</p><p>Chasing the now-fleeing villain, Ms. Marvel bursts into a room full of mannequin-like women, all under Puppet Master's control. Before she can make a move to free them, the massive fist of a giant-sized Stature breaks through the wall to pluck Ms. Marvel out of the room.</p><p>Agent Sum, Sleepwalker, and Machine Man (with a captive, mind-controlled Arana in tow) watch helplessly from the grounds of Puppet Master's estate as Stature tosses Ms. Marvel across the city. After dodging a house flung by Stature, Ms. Marvel manages to subdue her opponent with a flying uppercut.</p><p>Sleepwalker suddenly disappears from the battleground, as Rick Sheridan awakens back at the SHIELD minicarrier. Without Sleepwalker to help contain her, the puppeteered Arana breaks free and draws a machete on Ms. Marvel.</p><p>Puppet Master commands Arana to kill, but she resists – weakly saying, “I won't kill my mother.”</p><p>Carol is floored by the revelation that Arana thinks of her as a mother. She orders Agent Sum and Machine Man to return Arana to the safety of the minicarrier, and launches in pursuit of Puppet Master. Ms. Marvel smashes her way back into the house and breaks the puppet of a police woman, who she orders to smash all of the statues and evacuate the house.</p><p>Ms. Marvel confronts Puppet Master in his study, where he threatens to self-destruct his entire estate. Ms. Marvel has the upper hand, but she still allows him to press the destruct button – sending the house up in a mushroom cloud.</p><p>Ms. Marvel survives without a scratch</p><p>Half a day later, Beast calls Carol with the results of his latest battery of tests. Not only has she acquired a healing factor beyond Wolverine's, but the blip his noticed on his original scan was a ping – a tiny packet of data transmitted from Carol's body into outer space.</p><p>Suddenly, Carol is picking up a matching signal from low Earth orbit. Seconds later, an explosion rocks the minicarrier... Cru has returned.</p>",

            "description": "<p>A \"Sinestro Corps War\" tie-in! The Lanterns' war hits home as a yellow ring appears in El Paso. But is it being offered to the Scarab or to Jaime Reyes? And whose will is stronger?</p><p>The book opens with the destruction of the Sinestro Corps member of Sector 2. The ring scans for compatible users, and surprisingly, accepts Peacemaker. He resists the ring's attempt to take him over until the Reach arrive. They explain that there is a scarab on Peacemaker's spine, which the ring recognizes as a new host. They activate his scarab, which allows the two forces to make his mind dormant.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jaime's scarab detects a strange energy signature nearby. The signature is the new Sinestro/Scarab Peacemaker, resembling a monstrous version of Jaime's armor. He attacks Jaime, and has the upper hand, until Green Lantern Brik steps in. She attacks Jaime initally, until she realizes that Peacemaker is the enemy. Peacemaker continues to insert \"peace\" into his sentences, confusing Jaime. He deduces that Peacemaker's mind is still slightly active.</p><p>Jaime devises a plan, and asks the scarab to interfere with Peacemaker's scarab. They appear inside Peacemaker's mind, where Peacemaker, Jaime, and the Sinestro scarab are all shown as seperate minds. The Sinestro scarab attacks, but Jaime's scarab intervenes and kills it. This drives the ring away, and the armor recedes into Peacemker. Peacemaker slices off the scarab from his spine, and as he lies bleeding, asks only for peace.</p>",
