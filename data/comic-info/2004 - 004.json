            "description": "<em>As Spider-Man desperately navigates the seedy underworld of his most desperate and vile enemies, his missing family member is still nowhere to be found… The climax to this sold-out first arc features guest appearances by the Vulture, Black Cat, Electro, and The Owl… Get it fast, before they’re gone! </em><br /> <br />The Vulture kidnaps Peter Parker from the hospital because he wants to see the face of Spider-Man's secret identity! The Vulture having no personal ties to Peter does not recognize him as anyone he should know, and the Vulture reckons that he has been beaten time and time again by a \"nobody\". He then just drops Pete and leaves him to become a smear on the sidewalk!  <p>Enter The Black Cat! Felicia swings by just in time to catch pete and set him down on a rooftop! She then proceeds to fight the Vulture, ultimately managing to defeat and capture Adrian Toomes, and turns him over to the Owl, who has his men butcher and mangle Vulture's face, revealing the gory results to Electro in order to strike fear into him prior to torture over Max Dillon's role in the loss of Owl's money. Meanwhile as Peter recovers from gunshot wounds and his injuries from Vulture, J. Jonah Jameson receives photos of the unmasked web-slinger and says \"That's a very familiar looking face\"</p>",

When she gets there, she spots Spider-Man sneaking out of a second storey window, and asks the web-slinger what he's doing there. Spider-Man tries to leave, but MJ tells him that she's been looking for him since he saved her that night in the subway. MJ asks Spidey to the Homecoming Dance, and demands that he tells her who he is. Spidey says no to both and leaves to foil a bank robbery.</p><h4>Spoilers</h4><p>At school it is obvious that Harry thinks he and MJ are now a couple. Harry goes to kiss MJ, and she ducks. When the kiss finally happens, Harry is happy, but MJ is left feeling awkward.</p><p>Liz meets MJ at her locker and calls her and Harry lovebirds, but MJ is too preoccupied with her crush on Spider-Man. Liz explodes and tells Mary Jane that she needs to stop being infatuated with Spider-Man when she's already got Harry. Liz tells MJ not to be like Flash, who she believes is cheating on her with another girl, or at least crushing on someone else. Liz enlists MJ to help her find out who and MJ agrees, though she already secretly knows that she is the object of Flash's affection.</p><p>Flash finds MJ at her locker and asks her to help him study history that night at the library, and MJ awkwardly agrees. At the library, Flash goes on about how much he appreciates MJ for standing up for him when Liz calls him stupid, and MJ tries to shake off the compliments, saying that's what friends are for. Just as the situation gets really awkward, MJ tells Flash she forgot about something she promised to do with her mom and escapes.</p><p>The next day Liz confronts MJ about her study date, and asks if she found out who Flash is crushing on. MJ says that she doesn't know, and asks Liz not to confront him about it. Liz reveals to Mary Jane that she's been going through all of Flash's things, but with no luck.</p><p>That night at the football game, Liz spots Flash talking to a rival cheerleader and goes berserk, attacking the girl. Flash stops her and Liz tells him that she knows he's trying to replace her, before running off.</p><p>MJ finds Liz in the changing room, and tells her that she'll handle the situation with Flash. A grateful Liz tells MJ that she's the only friend she has left, and MJ feels even guiltier and guiltier.</p><p>After the game, Flash and MJ sit on the steps of the school and talk. MJ tells Flash that Liz didn't mean it, and that though she makes fun of him she really does love him. Flash says he understands, and is happy that Liz is in love with him. Flash and MJ hug. Liz walks by at just this moment, and misinterprets the entire thing.</p>",

            "description": "<i>This fourth volume of Osamu Tezuka's acclaimed Phoenix saga is set in 8th-century Japan and tells the story of two men: the hideously deformed mass murderer Gao and the handsome and gifted woodcarver Akanemaru. Fate brings them together when Gao cruelly stabs Akanemaru in the arm, crippling him. They part, but their destinies remain inextricably linked as both find their spirits tested in a series of personal and professional trials. Beautifully set against the religious and political upheavals of the time, Karma is considered by many to be the best volume in the entire Phoenix series.</i>",

The World's Greatest team-up of Earths' Mightiest Heroes climaxes with the fate of both universes hanging in the balance! This one is crammed full of everything you read comics for. Don't miss it!</i></p><h3>Plot Summary</h3><p>The final smackdown between every Avenger and League member ever vs. Krona -- for the existence of both universes!</p><p>Krona - Ruthless, immortal, he seeks the secret of creation. A glimpse of the formation of his own universe, of stars swirling in a cosmic hand, has set him on a quest to learn the truth at any cost. Cast from his home reality, he wanders the multiverse, destroying realities in his desire to see what gives them birth.</p><p>In time, he encounters the Grandmaster, who seeks to preserve his reality by challenging Krona to a game. Tempted by the prize - the secrets of Galactus, a being who lived through the big bang - Krona agrees. The game is played out by the Avengers and the Justice League, the champions of two universes.</p><p>But the game is a feint, a ruse that allows the Grandmaster to assemble twelve artifacts of great power. When Krona loses, he attacks the Grandmaster and begins to seize his prize. But the Grandmaster uses the artifacts to bring the two universes together, trapping Krona between them.</p><p>Krona is trapped - but not helpless. Now he has the artifacts - and he uses them to force the universes closer together, beginning to merge them into one.</p><p>The effect is cataclysmic. The realities are incompatible. Reality begins to warp unpredictably. Upheavals threaten to destroy both.</p><p>The JLA and the Avengers, their memories changing as reality does, discover the truth and stave off disaster temporarily. They make their way to the Grandmaster, finding him wounded, weak.</p><p>They learn what their realities were - what they should be. And they're shocked by their true history, which holds not only heroism and triumph, but death, madness, and loss. Hardest hit are Yellowjacket and the Wasp, who see their marriage fail, the Flash and Green Lantern, who see themselves die, and the Vision and Scarlet witch, who see children torn from them, lost forever.</p><p></p><p>Still, they choose to fight. To restore the truth. They'll have to do it without the Grandmaster, though. The Grandmaster is dead.</p>",

As the New Mutants and the Hellions battle for bragging rights, a long shadow from one of their pasts falls over the Xavier Institute! </em><br />   <br />As the Field Day exercise continues, Sofia tries to fly over Santo, who is blocking the way into the hedge maze. Julian blocks the way above with his telekinesis by putting up an invisible wall, and he and Sofia end up in a battle of wills, distracting Sofia from the task at hand. After a bit of urging, David comes up with a plan, but Brian uses his powers on him, making the others all run away from him. Josh, Laurie, and Kevin make it to the other side of the hedge maze and proceed with the plan to use Kevin’s power to wither a path through the hedge wall. David goes after Nori and helps her out as she used her entire charge to escape. As Jay arrives to where the object is hidden, Kevin, Laurie, and Josh make it through the wall and see that there is a live dragon at the center. Kevin decides to use his power on the dragon, but Josh stops him. Laurie tries to use her pheromones, but before she has a chance, Jay uses his special singing voice to calm the dragon. After a quick conference over Brian’s use of his powers, the Hellions are announced as the winners, and Josh goes off on Sofia for her lack of strategy in leading them. Josh and Nori both suggest that David take over leadership, but David tells them that he stands by Sofia. Later, Laurie finds Sofia crying in their room and decides to go have a talk with Josh about it. Cessily finds Kevin working on his industrial art and they talk for a while, and Cessily shows him that, because she is made of mercury, he can touch her without hurting her. Unfortunately, that isn’t the touch he was looking for. Outside, Josh plays basketball with Victor until he spots Rahne and tries to get her to go out with him again, but when she says no, he spots Laurie. She asks if they can talk about the Sofia thing, and he agrees and invites her to go out for dinner with him on a date, which makes both Rahne and Kevin jealous. Kevin joins Cessily to dinner in the cafeteria, and after a quick talk, Julian agrees to let him sit with them. Nearby, Sofia expresses her fears to David that the squad is angry with her, and he does his best to make her feel better, though to little success. Dani is upset that Kevin doesn’t seem to be taking to the rest of her kids, and Emma takes the opportunity to tell Dani that it is her fault. And just to make things perfect, Agent Justin Pierce arrives to arrest Kevin Ford for the murder of his father…",

            "description": "<p>Jubilee watches the butler, Brad, take care of her still injured Aunt Hope. Jubilee asks her aunt if it’s still okay with her going to the school dance. Jubilee can go and thanks Hope for that. She happily calls up her friend Meg, who hangs up afterwards because she is too busy talking on an Internet chat room, believing she is talking to Carson Daily. The next day, when Jubilee goes back to her counseling duties after class, she finds a rather sad Judy. When Jubilee asks Judy what’s wrong, she explains that her car has been stolen and she is desperate. Since there are no appointments for Jubilee today, she can leave. Jubilee notices a picture of Judy’s car and takes it, promising to see what she can do about it. Jubilee contacts Charlie again, who takes her to the hideout of Shane Shooter and his gang. Jubilee can convince Shooter to help her retrieve the car. Shooter does his best to help out. He takes Jubilee to a car mechanic, who doesn’t know anything about the car but suggests to check out with a guy named Pike. They do, but Dex has set them up and Pike and his guards open fire upon them. Shooter and Jubilee fight back, using their powers and hereby revealing to each other that they are both mutants. They escape from Pike’s place before the cops arrive and go home, with Shooter promising to keep helping Jubilee until the car has been found. When Jubilee goes back home, she sees her Aunt Hope, who has gone out after she got better, but this time has bullet holes in her coat. Jubilee asks what’s up with that, but Hope fakes an explanation. Hope asks Jubilee why she is so late, and Jubilee tells Hope about the car, showing her the picture. When Jubilee goes to bed, Hope makes a few calls. The next day at school, Jubilee finds out that the car is back! Startled, she rushes to Judy’s office and finds Judy and Principal Avery kissing! Judy says that she knows the car is back and believes some punks must have taken it and brought it back after a ride in it or something. Later that night, Hope and Brad put on bullet free vests and leather clothes. They check their guns, and are ready to go out…</p>",
