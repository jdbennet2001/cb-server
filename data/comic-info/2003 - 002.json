            "description": "<p><em>Her past has always been a mystery, even to her, but soon Domino will discover secrets about herself than even she would rather have never uncovered.</em></p><p>Domino hacks her own way into the dead hacker’s apartment to see if he made a copy of the CD which was destroyed. Though his computer is in police custody, she discovers a back-up CD hidden inside a fish tank just before two robed men attack her, though she quickly defeats them. Still wondering why they were after her, she returns to her hotel room and finds Jonathan waiting for her. As she showers, he secretly downloads the CD to a handheld gadget. They argue about how little information has actually been gathered about her mother before he mentions that he has another assignment for her regarding the patrilineal clan network of Somalia. His pager goes off just as they appear to be about to reveal feelings for each other and he leaves, telling her to get some rest as they leave for Mogadishu in the morning. She checks out the information on the CD and discovers information about something called Project Armageddon which her mother appears to be involved with. Jonathan watches her covertly on a monitor from another hotel room and speaks with several other people around the world, asking them to check on Project Armageddon and if the project has any links with Domino or her relatives. Domino meanwhile contacts Cable who is on a mission and after telling her he knows nothing about Project Armageddon, signs off abruptly. As he hangs up, she turns and speaks to the camera watching her, having known all the time that Jonathan was spying on her. However, in his room Jonathan is attacked by two more robed men, possibly the same ones who attacked Domino and in order to protect the information he has, Jonathan self-destructs his apartment, killing all three men. Meanwhile, in the Florida Everglades two soldiers shot a man for, in their words, “seeking to undermine the security of this great country.”</p><p><b>Full Synopsis: </b></p><p>(day eleven)</p><p>An underground car park in Atlanta is eerily quiet. Three security guards have been taken out with tranquilizer darts and Domino has made her way up the stairwell while thinking about the last few days. Her assignment was supposed to be easy; meet the hacker, get the goods and finally find her long-lost mom. One ‘copter crash, a dead hacker and a helluva lot of unwanted publicity later and all she has is a picture of a woman who may not even be her mother and the local and federal government on her back. They say that the first step is the hardest, she thinks, let’s see what step two holds.</p><p>Using a laptop with a complex looking program, she manages to break the hacker’s security code governing his apartment which has been sealed off by police following his death. Her hacking must have included a little luck as the deceased would have placed a powerful door code to prevent entry. She enters his apartment and she finds that step two holds a big fat mess. The apartment is the typical hackers place, mess everywhere and nothing filed where it would logically be. Clicking on a couple of torches on the side of her head (Orbital style), she leafs through his filing cabinet and realizes that she’ll never find anything there. Though his monitors remain, the computers are long gone, evidence taken away by police. They’ll have some stories to tell, thinks Domino as she realizes that maybe luck just isn’t on her side tonight.</p><p>She checks the rest of the apartment, knowing that a hacker worth his salt would have kept a backup of the CD which was destroyed. He may have been paranoid but he wasn’t stupid. She thinks that if she was a friendless computer geek, where would she hide it. She spots a fish tank and reckons she’d keep it with her only friends. She dips her hand in the water and reaches inside the pirate chest laid at the bottom and her luck kicks in. The backup CD is there and she smiles for a second before the reflective surface reveals a robed man with a sword behind her ready to strike.</p><p>Domino ducks as the sword slices the air above her and cracks the fish tank. She tries to land a kick in her assailant’s face but he avoids her and a second man punches her. The guns she is holding are knocked clean out of her hands and one of them is caught be one of her enemies. She readies herself for a fight, grabbing a lamp stand and using it as a bo-staff. The swordsman snaps it in two but Domino still manages to break the rest over the second man‘s head and throw him over her back. She then uses her athleticism to flip her right leg behind her and over her own shoulder, landing a kick on the swordsman who is defenestrated. She quickly looks behind her to find the first man has vanished and a look through the window finds no trace of the second. She reflects on the fight and wonders what the hell that was about and why they were here at the apartment. It’s time to find some answers.</p><p>In downtown Atlanta, at the shapely Georgia Marquee Hotel in the Peachtree area, Domino returns to her room and flicks the light switch on, immediately saying, “Get out.” Seated facing the television set is Jonathan who replies that a hello would suffice. He says he came as soon as word reached him. Domino places her laptop on the television set cabinet and tells him that his name doesn’t appear on the hotel registry for this room and he should take the hint. He sits, fingers clasped together and seemingly not bothered by Domino’s slight hostility. He tells her he traveled through six time zones to be there and Domino replies that she appreciates the thought but he’s wasting his time; she can handle things on her own. As she heads into the bathroom stripping off her top, Jonathan asks her if she can handle the label ‘mutant terrorist,’ mentioning her presence in Centennial Park but she reiterates that she can handle it as she shuts the bathroom door.</p><p>As she cleans herself up and showers, Jonathan grabs her laptop and chats to her as he connects some leads to it. He asks Domino whether she uncovered any useful information in regards to her mother before their friend met his accident. She thinks for a second before replying no. He says he’s sorry to hear that as he downloads information from the computer onto a handheld device. He asks if he left her with any leads to explore, maybe a name but Domino says he left nothing and asks if he has anything to report from his end. Before he answers, he is left speechless as she emerged from the bathroom in a slightly revealing dressing gown.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Florida Everglades, a man rushes through the swamp in terror, saying, “Dead. I’m dead, they’re right behind me,” to himself. As he is distracted by looking backwards, he fails to notice a branch sticking out of the water and trips over it, finding himself face to snout with an alligator. Suddenly, out of nowhere a man in military attire leaps onto the alligator’s back and rams a knife into its eye which causes the beast to flip him before swimming off in pain.</p><p>The soldier, wearing a black t-shirt, black beret and khaki trousers watches it disappear as the frightened man pushes himself against a nearby tree and says, “Anything you want! Just name it! Just please don’t kill me.” The soldier fires his pistol three times, missing the man’s head by inches each time. He looks petrified as the soldier lights a cigar and says, “Mr. Mallory. You are a dead man. You thought to pry into a matter of national security. I know your cover is a joke. I know the people you work for. You seek to undermine the security of this great country. I’m done screwing around. Soldier?” Another soldier aims his pistol at Mallory’s head and fires at point blank, killing him.</p><p>Back in Atlanta, Domino wants some answers and tells Jonathan that he promised her information and all she has is a picture. Jonathan is surprised she has the picture which Domino tells him came from the hacker. He asks questioningly whether she thinks a picture of her mother is important. Drying her hair, Domino replies that it’s a picture but it could be of anyone. Jonathon reminds her that the hacker was highly regarded and is about to tell her he seriously doubts it would be anyone other than her mother but she cuts him off, saying the bottom line is she has no evidence that what she’s getting is equal to what she’s giving. She wants results. Jonathan replies that if things were that easy then she wouldn’t need his assistance and anyway, she isn’t without resources of her own.</p><p>She turns and peers out of the window over night-time Atlanta and tells Jonathan that she has vague recollections of a woman, but she doesn’t know her, doesn’t know where she herself is from, not even <i>who</i> she is. She needs something more, unable to accept that this is <i>all</i> she knows of her life. He tells her he understands but adds that he didn’t just come here to make sure she was all right; he came because another mission of dire urgency has arisen. He asks her how familiar she is with the patrilineal clan network of Somalia. Domino uncovers her head from the towel and angrily questions this change of direction, telling him that firstly he doesn’t dictate her schedule or her life; she can come and go as she pleases. Secondly, she adds, the way she figures it he still owes her for the last time. The hacker boy didn’t cut it and she wants hard evidence, and she wants it yesterday.</p><p>He puts his hand up to calm her and asks her to curtail her anger and save it for the enemy. He will help her but first she must help him. Domino is furious by now and says, “Tell you what, why don’t you take your help and shove it right up your….” Jonathan grabs her wrist and shout, “Enough!” Domino glares at him, telling him he has two seconds to let go of her wrist before his gets broken. Jonathan tries to tell her something but stumbles over his words. “Domino…I..” Domino calmly replies yes, expecting a different response to the one she receives. He looks at the floor and holding his pager in his hand, tells her he has to go, and she should get some rest as they leave for Mogadishu in the morning. Domino looks upset as Jonathan departs using his crutches.</p><p>The room now feels empty as Domino thinks about getting back to business. She reaches for her laptop and switches it on. On the screen, the omega symbol appears and she reads the words ‘Project Armageddon: Weapon of Last Resort’ which arc their way around the omega symbol. Project Armageddon, she thinks, maybe she’s stolen a copy of next fall’s Fox television line up. Then again, maybe not. As she brings up numerous windows, she thinks to herself that if this project is as big as it claims, then how in hell has it stayed so hidden for so long. We’re talking about a weapon, a perfect weapon here which if she’s right, could destroy civilization. Something like this isn’t easy to hide but of course, her mother knows a great deal about hiding so maybe it’s not so farfetched if she’s involved. Suddenly she turns, looks at the curtains to her right and says, “Hello?”</p><p>Elsewhere, Jonathan enters a darkened room and connects himself to an earpiece which is in turn connected to an array of monitors and a computer system. He introduces himself by his pseudonym, Big Bad Wolf and reports that a link has been established with Little Red Riding Hood. He continues to say that he is currently uploading CD files and asks those on the other end to prepare to authenticate data. On the screens are representatives from all around the globe, all on monitors surrounding the omega symbol which appeared on Domino’s laptop. Jonathan continues, “Verify all known references to ‘Project Armageddon.’ Cross-reference CIA, FBI, S.H.I.E.L.D and Pentagon records and databases. Establish contact with our A.I.M and Hydra ‘resources’ for any potential intelligence sharing. Use the designated Swiss account if either party is favorable.” He continues to tell them to also explore any possible links between said project and the subject, Domino or any relations therein. They have ten minutes. He signs himself off as he watches Domino on another monitor, sat at her laptop.</p><p>As she types away, Domino wonders what her mom has gotten herself into; why couldn’t she have been a supermarket clerk or a Fortune 500 CEO or something else easy? No, she had to involve herself in some kind of black-ops end-of-the-world thingamajig which is too big for her. She needs to bring in the big guns. She contacts Cable and his face appears on her screen. He is on a mission and holding a rifle with telescopic sighting. She tells him what her problem is and he replies that he’s never heard of Project Armageddon. He adds that she shouldn’t bother him; she’s a big girl and should handle it. He has too many problems to deal with now and if she thinks she’s unable to cope, then she should maybe contact the X-Men or Avengers. Before Domino can ask anything further, he logs off and Domino is exasperated at his response. She swivels on her chair and looks directly at the camera Jonathan is using to spy on her. “I guess it’s just me and you Jonathan, you up for it?” she asks.</p><p>Watching this from his base, Jonathan thinks ‘she’s good.’ She knew he was watching her the whole time. Of course, he thinks, he shouldn’t be surprised as one should always be aware of one’s surroundings and he reaches for his crutch as two robed swordsmen approach him from behind. As the first sword is about to be brought down on him, he swings his crutch over his left shoulder and pierces the first assailant through the chest, his crutch going all the way through and out the other side, covered in blood. The man’s sword crashes into one of the monitors. Jonathan falls backwards from his chair as his second opponent tries to slice him but he uses the crutch, still in the other man’s chest, to block the blow and throws the first man over his head with the crutch taking his partner with him. However, the uninjured man leaps backwards and is about to bring his sword down on Jonathan as lying on the ground, he reaches inside his jacket pocket.</p><p>Domino meanwhile discovers some employee files on her laptop, files relating to her mother complete with a photograph. After all these years, she thinks, after all her efforts, she’s found her mother at last. Maybe her luck is about to change. At the same time, Jonathan pulls a small device from his pocket and before the sword can be plunged into him, the top floor of the hotel rocks with a huge explosion.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Mark Milton, Hyperion is coming of age and seeking to interact with others his own age, and while the world begins to discover other individuals with strange tales to tell.</p><p>Mark is having his history lesson by his tutor as he suddenly vaporizes the book out of her hands. His father comes to talk to Mark and tries to figure out whats wrong. Mark explains his restlessness about being confined and learning about the world around him when he has never set foot anywhere besides the compound he grew up in.</p><p>The government officials overseeing the Hyperion project have no intention of trusting Mark and create a school environment to their specifications and control. Mark's first day at school begins with him being driven by a Tank to school.</p><p>Somewhere at a mental institution, a man begins to explain his horror as his wife and him witness Mark's ship and mistake it for a shooting star. Debbie, his wife, hoping their future child to be a boy. A few months later, Debbie is caught in labor on the roadside by the coast. As the baby was coming, Debbie realized something was wrong. Both of them went into shock and couldn't believe their eyes. Phil, the patient and husband sits on the beach murmuring to god. Debbie takes the child and walks off into the water and drowns herself. Phil repetitively yells that he didn't kill her and the child was not his or human. Debbie floated in the water till the life drained from her eyes as her child looked upon her.</p><p>Near a Southern church, a couple and their child are walking home. A hawk is heard screeching in the distant, flying overhead. The father begins to explain that was a Nighthawk and flies only at night because nothing can see its shadow as it hunts. The Mother, Rosalie tells her son, Kyle, that her father Titus Richmond is full of it. Soon after a bunch of rednecks pull up in their truck and begin to harass the couple and shoot them on site, leaving the Kyle in the night as a nighthawk flies overhead.</p><p>Next, we meet Joe Ledger, the doctor, being picked up by the government for an experiment which involves the crystal from Mark's ship. They explain to him the properties and anomalies of the crystal and how a focused mind is the only one who can use it. At a firing range, Joe begins to practice firing the crystal. First the energy is so intense and painful, but after some practice begins to learn control of the crystal. Because the energy is still burning in his palm, Joe decides to place it on back of his wrist and the crystal begins to fuse into his skin. Joe falls unconscious and into a possible coma.</p><p>In a random underground sanctuary, a child and his mother bring offerings of food to someone named the princess. The child believes this to be only a fairytale and the rats eat the food. The mother explains that this be please the princess and someday she will return and be greatful for the offerings. The boy still doesn't believe a word she is saying till he hears the feint words, \"Something is stirring in the world outside.\" The mother finds this intriguing and continues on her way out as a frail hand is seen reaching for the food.</p><p>Mark arrives at his first day of school and isn't greeted to the warm welcome he envisioned. For the better part of the day, he sets himself apart and observes each person. Everyone is keeping their distance from Mark. With his X-Ray vision, he overhears a group of girls discussing Mark. Each one explains their natural instinct at how Mark is different. Mark realizes that he is the only one of his kind, to his knowledge.</p><p><b>General Notes</b></p><p>Richard Isanove provides inks for the cover only.</p>",

It grew spikes on its arms and shoots them through Wolverine. When it goes in for the kill, its chest gets blown out in a blast of green energy. Wolverine, still skewered, looks up to see a robot that tells him the thing that he just fought was a Mandate and that you have to shoot the orb-core to kill them. Fusa, who was with the robot, goes down to see Wolverine as he passes out. He wakes up in their base where there are other people who are hiding from The Mandate. Fusa tells him that he is on Earth but in the year 2058. She gives him a quick version of what's going on and tells him that the robot (The Colonel) is built to kill the Mandate but he's almost out of ammo. Before she can say anything more, they are attacked by a Mandate that had followed them to the base. Wolverine kills it and tells them he wants to know the whole story.</p>",

She is Kidens teacher and hasnt got much sleep because of the incident the day before with Kiden and the gang fight at school. She expresses her concern and suspects something happens as she said it was like somehing skipped (Kiden manipulating time).</p><p>Back at the NIxon apartment, Kiden is eating alphabet cereal and if you look closely they spell 'kill me'. Tyler starts going on about the incident yesterday but is interrupted when his mum finds a suspicious white powder in his room. Tyler says he can explain but Elizabeth is in no mood for it. She takes the powder and drops it down the toilet. Tyler attacks her but KIden screms saying she just wants the family to be normal for 5 minutes. She then walks to school.</p><p>At school Hectors arm is in a cast and hes not happy about it so he bribes a security guard to let him slip something in. Inside the principles office Kiden is asked if she is on drugs because of her behaviour but is eventually let go. Cameron goes after her. Kiden sees Kara and they go to their lesson but see Hector. He opens the package he snuck into school and inside it is.... a pistol.</p><p>Cameron finally sees Kiden but Hector fires the bullet. Kiden screams stop it and time stops. The bullet misses her. She touches the gun but it burns her finger, proving that she can feel things in her 'no time' dimension. She accidentally touches Hector and he falls over. Time is reset and the bullet hits someone.... Cameron Palmer.</p><p>We then go months into the future at Camerons place. Its a tip and she is now single. THe headmaster walks in and asks her to come back to work but she cant and asks where Kiden is, hinting that maybe kiden ran away or something. The headmaster cant answer and leaves, accidentally knocking over a photo frame. It shatters and makes a noise like a bullet being fired. Cam freaks and shouts at the man to leave.</p><p>Later that night someone walks into cameroons flat wearing a hoody to cover their face. They see and empty bottle of vicodin and freak out, immediately running to search for cameron. It is revealed to be Kiden. She finds Cameron in her tub which is half full with blood...</p>",

The titanic team-up the world has waited for continues as the threats that brought the heroes together in the first issue tear the teams apart! Guest- starring every character to ever belong to the Avengers and the JLA!</em></p><h3>Plot Summary</h3><p>The Avengers and the Justice League of America continue collecting the items they have been told can save their realities. They battle each other in the pursuit, while Batman and Captain America attempt to find out who's behind it all.</p><p>Across realities, a powerful and mysterious danger looms.</p><p>The Mighty Avengers and the Justice League of America, the greatest heroes of their respective worlds, have been dealing with bizarre intruders - villains and monsters from each universe are appearing in the other, on earth and through space.</p><p>The Justice League is contacted by the enigmatic grandmaster, a being from the other universe. He tells them both universes are in danger and unless the JLA goes in search of twelve items of power scattered across the twin realms, a universe will die.</p><p>They travel to the other earth, finding it a bizarre, unsettling place where monsters and killers roam free, tyrants rule their nations with an iron hand, and innocents die for being genetic mutants. They have little respect for any heroes who protect this world. Superman, in particular, is appalled at the state of it.</p><p>However, when they reach the first item - the staggeringly powerful Ultimate Nullifier - they are confronted by the Avengers and hurled back to their own world. They manage to bring the Nullifier with them.</p><p>The Avengers encounter the cosmic scholar Metron, from the JLA's world. He tells them of the items of power and cautions them to secure them first, to safeguard their universe.</p><p>The Avengers, using technology from Metron, travel to the JLA's world. It is a surprising, unusual place to their eyes, where futuristic cities exist and super heroes are lionized and praised. They don't know what to make of it. Captain America thinks it must be a totalitarian state where superhumans rule the populace, rather than protecting them.</p><p>The JLA confronts the Avengers, and a melee breaks out.</p><p>What neither group knows, however, is that they are playing a game. A game devised by the Grandmaster to deal with a powerful intruder - who has already destroyed at least two universes, and who is determined to destroy a third. An intruder named Krona.</p>",

A young Emma Frost continues to explore the ramifications of her blossoming powers...</em></p><p>Emma was finally able to regain consciousness in the nurse's office. She discovers that the mid-terms were rescheduled because of her passing out. Emma returns to class to see Matilda Brant making fun of her by saying she passed out on purpose to watch MTV. After school, her teacher talked to her about her passing out and screaming. Emma kept denying that it was anything serious and she goes home. When she got home, she finds out her father had found out she passed out because she \"skipped breakfast.\" Her father fires the maid for not feeding his daughter and Emma tries to persuade her father that it wasn't the maid's fault. Emma is then confronted by her brother Christian and asks why she hasn't told them about the voices, he then tells her that he is going to tell their parents. Emma then displays her psychic abilities by revealing Christian's dirty secrets, he then backs off of her. The next day, Emma was so worried about the mid-term because she hasn't studied. Then all of a sudden she heard voices, they were the answers to the test and then Emma got an A on it. During fencing, Matilda accuses Emma of cheating and then they fenced against each other. Emma realizes that she could hear what Matilda was thinking and beats her easily. Emma is later forced to retake the midterm because of suspected cheating, to her surprise she got a perfect score again. However, Emma admits to her teacher that she left some of them blank on purpose. As it turns out, her father had pulled some strings to get her a perfect score.</p>",

He doesn't react well when informed that S.H.I.E.L.D. have seized all of his company assets. <br /> <br />Presenting his findings to Nick Fury and the rest of the Ultimates, Pym also shares with them the information that Dr. Octopus has come forward and is willing to do his part to help out and begin to atone for his past behavior. Fury poses the question to the Ultimates asking if that offer should be accepted as it'll be up to them to clean up the mess if Octopus is leading them on. <br /> <br />The offer is accepted and Dr. Octopus is taken to the lab where he'll be able to help the science team work on formulae to stabilize the genetic manipulation undertaken on himself and the other prisoners. There he is also re-introduced to something he'd been missing since his arrest, his arms. And he's quick to take advantage. The high security cells' power supply is terminated and the prisoners emerge. The power dampening collars also become deactivated. Osborn, Kraven, Electro and the Sandman are free and ready to wreak havoc on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Triskelion's staff.  </p>",

He sacrificed himself to save his home world of Zenn-La from the planet-devouring menace Galactus, saving those he loved in exchange for a life of servitude as the Silver Surfer. Now, after disobeying his master, Norrin Radd is stranded on the planet Earth - forever removed from his love, Shalla-Bal, and from the beckoning spaceways!</i></p><p><i>A high point of epic adventure and lyrical drama, the Silver Surfer took the comic-book super hero to all-new heights. Using their ravaged protagonist as a lens through which they could comment on the social injustices of the era, Stan Lee and John Buscema turned the Surfer into the ultimate outsider archetype, reflecting the reader's world in his metallic skin. In these pages, the Surfer will face ghosts from beyond the grave seeking redemption, the horrors of war, the devious Mephisto, and mighty Marvel heroes including Spider-Man to the Human Torch and the Inhumans.</i></p><p><i>So what more do you need to know?

            "description": "<p><em>Dark Horse Comics is proud to present the second volume of Mark Schultz's award-winning Xenozoic Tales. Schultz's vision of our Earth's future includes guano-powered Cadillacs, warring factions of humanity battling for ruined cities, reborn dinosaurs, and their intelligent, humanoid descendants. The tough-as-nails shaman, Jack Tenrec, and the beautiful scientist, Hannah Dundee, seek to uncover the origins and secrets of their violent world while dealing with their own rocky relationship. <strong>Xenozoic Tales</strong> became a major network cartoon as \"Cadillacs and Dinosaurs\", and the storytelling talents of Mark Schultz earned him three Harvey Awards as Best Cartoonist. Schultz recently finished writing a critically-acclaimed run on Superman and is writing the upcoming Superman/Batman vs. Aliens/Predator series. Once you let the profound creativity of Xenozoic Tales sink its teeth in you, you'll be screaming for more! Featured in this volume are the grippings tales \"Primeval,\" \"Last Link in the Chain,\" and \"The Growing Pool.\" Also, for the first time ever, <strong>Xenozoic Tales</strong> #13 and #14 are collected in book form. This volume has a new cover and additional sketchbook material by Schultz.</em></p>",
