            "description": "<p><em>\"CHOOSING SIDES\" PART 1 (OF 5) For the young mutants at the <i> </i><i>Xavier Institute</i>, life will never be the same! The children at the X-Mansion thought they had it tough when <i> </i><i>Professor X</i> was running things – but now that <i> </i><i>X-Men Cyclops</i> and <i> </i><i>Emma Frost </i>have taken over the reins of the school, they're wishing for the simpler times of yesterday! Codenames, school-issued uniforms and mandatory training sessions in the <i> </i><i>Danger Room </i>are just a few of the changes being implemented around the Institute – but when the entire student body is forced to divide itself up into small squads and \"choose sides,\" Xavier's will never be the same again! </em></p><p>As a new semester begins at the newly rebuilt Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, there are quite a few changes in store. Scott Summers, AKA Cyclops, and Emma Frost are now co-headmasters of the school, and they have a different idea of how the school will be run. Students will all be trained to use their powers and be taught self-defense, on top of their regular school classes. The new students, including <a href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\"> Noriko Ashida </a>and <a href=\"/icarus/4005-9739/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9739\"> Josh Guthrie</a>, are given a tour by the headmasters, and Nori begins to butt heads with Miss Frost. Nori also damages her <a href=\"/surges-gauntlets/4055-56424/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56424\"> gauntlets</a> unknowingly, and while in the cafeteria with <a href=\"/prodigy/4005-40475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\"> David Alleyne</a>, <a href=\"/renascence/4005-40537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40537\"> Sofia Mantega</a>, <a href=\"/wallflower/4005-40535/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40535\"> Laurie Collins</a>, and <a href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\"> Josh Foley</a>, her electricity powers begin to act up, causing a blackout. The five of them set out to find the missing piece of Nori’s gauntlet, steal Scott’s keycard to get into the Danger Room where the missing piece was lost during the tour. As they enter, Nori has to release her charge and accidentally causes the Danger Room to activate a program, unleashing a pair of sentinels and a crowd of armed soldiers on the five mutant students. Through luck and teamwork, they manage to beat the program and find Nori’s missing regulator knob. Unfortunately, everything isn’t right, and David tells the others what he saw on the computer screen in Mr. Summers’ office. All the students are being separated into different squads, and the five of them might not want to get too comfortable hanging out. They may be getting broken up …</p>",

And faces the truth of the terrible things he was forced to do as the Winter Soldier. And with Cap caught in a conflict he can neither take a side of - or understand - what moves can he make to try to redeem himself? And what do Hydra have planned for New York this Christmas? Featuring guest appearances by the Young Avengers and some of the original Invaders, this Special issue is an action-packed character study that defines the Winter Soldier’s future place in the Marvel Universe. By Wizard Top Ten writer Ed Brubaker, with dynamic art by Lee Weeks (Civil War Frontline) and a cover by Cap fan-fave Steve Epting.</em></p><h2>Synopsis</h2><p>The story starts out on Christmas Eve, 1944. Bucky Barnes and Thomas \"Toro\" Raymond prepare to spend the evening taking a break from the war and enjoying themselves during the war. We fast forward to modern day where we find the Winter Soldier on his way to an appointment. En route, he recieves a call from Nick Fury, the former head of SHIELD, who informs him that he has a mission he needs Barnes to do.</p><p>Having no choice, the Winter Soldier finds three of the Young Avengers, Patriot, Hawkeye (Kate Bishop), and the Vision about to raid, what they think is, a Stark factory. The warehouse is really a Hydra base.</p><p>After some fighting and arguing, the quartet soon find themselves in a battle against an army of Hydra operatives. During the fight, Winter Soldier soon comes to realize that these \"kids\" have the potential to do well.</p><p>After the Vision is able to deduce that the Winter Soldier is, in fact, Bucky Barnes, they follow him to a cemetary where he is dealing with the fact that he killed Jack Monroe, Captain America's former sidekick, Nomad.</p><p>After the three Young Avengers pay their respect to Bucky, we find Barnes meeting with Namor. They are standing at another gravesite, that of Thomas Raymond, where they discuss his life as a hero.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p> <p>“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” With those words, millions of readers were introduced to Stephen King’s Roland—an implacable gunslinger in search of the enigmatic Dark Tower, powering his way through a dangerous land filled with ancient technology and deadly magic. Now, in a comic book personally overseen by King himself, Roland’s past is revealed! Sumptuously drawn by Jae Lee and Richard Isanove, adapted by long-time Stephen King expert Robin Furth (author of Stephen King’s The Dark Tower: A Concordance) and scripted by New York Times Best-seller Peter David, this series delves deep into Roland’s origins—the perfect introduction to this incredibly realized world, while long-time fans will thrill to adventures merely hinted at in the novels. Be there for the very beginning of a modern classic of fantasy literature!</p> <p>The story begins with a flashback to before Roland Deschain became a gunslinger. Roland and his friends, Cuthbert Allgood, Alain Johns, and others are in training under the command of Cort. Cort is a man whose word is law in the training.<br /></p> <p>After a hard day's training, Roland is stopped by Marten Broadcloak, the wizard and advisor to Roland's father, Steven. Marten tells Roland that his mother wishes to speak to him. As Steven is away, Roland discovers his mother, half dressed, in bed. It is obvious what had transpired and that Marten wanted Roland to witness this.</p> <p>Roland makes his way to Cort's place and put forth the challenge to become a gunslinger. Knowing that his options are to either best Cort and become a gunslinger or face exile, Roland has no other option. Cort reminds him that Roland is still some years from being ready. Roland is determined.</p> <p>Ready to face Cort in battle, Roland's weapon of choice is his hawk, David. Using David to attack Cort, Roland is given the opening he needs. David's eventual sacrifice allows Roland to defeat Cort.</p> <p>With his victory, Roland has been granted the title of a gunslinger, two years earlier than his father had earned it. Roland is given the right to take on his father's first year guns.<br /></p> <p>Roland confronts Marten, who is surprised he's met his challenge. Roland, knowing that Marten wished him to fail, decides not to take on Marten just yet.</p> <p>After spending the night fully becoming a man, Roland is woken up by his father, who has returned. He is not happy.</p>",

He lives in an abandoned building and is terrorized by an older street thug named Lagreen who takes any money Billy gets and beats him if he doesn't cooperate. As Billy sits in his room during a storm, Lagreen barges into his room.</p><p>Earlier, Billy was enjoying some hot soup with an older homeless man, Talky. Billy sees a man that looks like his father across the street. Billy follows him into the subway. They get on a red and yellow train with a yellow lightning bolt on the side. The train makes a stop and the mystery man tells Billy to get off.</p><p>Inside a big cavern, Billy sees seven statues, Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness, and Injustice along with an old man sitting at the end of the room. Billy assumes he's God but he tells him he's just a wizard. He says his time is short and he needs a replacement.</p><p>The wizard chose a magic word for Billy comprised of the name of heroes whose powers he will gain: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. Upon saying \"Shazam,\" Billy is transformed into Captain Marvel.</p><p>Marvel is told he has a new host. Just then, his time is gone and the wizard is seemingly crushed.</p><p>Back in his room, Billy utters the word, \"Shazam!\" and Lagreen is thrown out of the window.</p><p>Later Captain Marvel flies back in time with Billy to the Rock of Eternity. The Rock sits at the moment of the Big Bang. Billy wants to go to the top of the mountain to see what lies before our universe was born. Captain Marvel tells him that it is forbidden. Inside, they talke to the spirit of the wizard. Captain Marvel believes that Billy should be living a better life. The wizard discovers that Billy has a younger sister that he was unaware of.</p><p>About to utter the magic word, Billy is stopped. Using magic at the Rock of Eternity would cause a terrible paradox. He is told to wait outside. Just then, the eyes of the seven statues open. This indicates that something big is going down back on Earth.</p><p>Going to get Billy to head back, they find he is not outside. His bottom of his shoes can be seen floating above the tip of the mountain. Marvel snatches him down.</p><p>Billy awakes back in his room. Thinking it was a dream, he hears the noise of police sirens and helicopters. Out the window he hears a women call for help. Going down, he finds the two preying on the woman are not men, but rather alligators dressed in clothes that can talk. They tell Captain Marvel that their leader, Mr. Mind, will be looking for him.</p>",

But a powerful enemy from the X-Men's past has a different agenda - and his plans to hijack the Helicarrier for his own uses lead to a terrible revelation.</em></p><p>Exodus returns from being banished to Nowhere.</p><p>On a S.H.I.E.L.D. hellicarrier, Rogue, Cable, and Mystique talk to Director Maria Hill about using their technology to help Northstar and Aurora. They want to try to continue the treatment S.H.I.E.L.D. started on Northstar after he had been brainwashed by the Hand. They also hope to cure Aurora of her schizophrenia. The VR programming would allow them to relive their entire lives. Hill reluctantly allows them provided they do not get in her way.</p><p>As the programming is in progress, the hellicarrier is attacked. Exodus and his Acolytes, Random, Frenzy, and Tempo infiltrate the carrier. The S.H.I.E.L.D. computer is hacked into which causes an overload which puts a stop to the programming before it is complete. Northstar and Aurora come out with their minds scrambled. Their minds seem to have been merged into one. Confused, they simply run at high speed. Eventually, they decided to stop running and face their confusion together. Joining hands, they generate a bright light. Seemingly cured, they help put a stop to the Acolytes.</p><p>The three X-Men give chase but are intercepted by the Acolytes. As they fight, Exodus is in the hellicarrier control room and constructs a make shift Cerebro unit to detect mutants. It is his plan to find all the new mutants being born after the Decimateion and create a new Genosha. The X-Men arrive and inform Exodus that there aren't any new mutants. The results of the Decimation have changed the human genome and the x-gene is no longer present.</p><p>Enraged, Exodus and his Acolytes leave. They soon venture to Antartica where Exodus bows down in front of a man in shadows with red eyes who is well-known in the X-universe.</p>",

So then why has he always failed?</em></p><p><em>Now, having been sent hurtling through time, BARON HELMUT ZEMO will have a chance to encounter the truth of his family AS IT HAPPENED IN THE PAST -- when he comes FACE TO FACE with the first of his family line, the legendary Baron Harbin Zemo! But how much of what we know of our family history is truth and how much has been embellished by the perspective of time?</em></p><p><em>Can Zemo find a way to escape his situation or will he choose to stay trapped in time if it means preventing his family lineage from a legacy of failure?</em></p><p>It's been three months since Baron Zemo sacrificed himself to save the world. In Manhattan, Wendell Volker is trying to piece together the Zemo history for a thesis paper. He feels he cannot complete his thesis without talking to Zemo face to face.</p><p>In 1503, Baron Harbin Zemo is close to the end of his life. He is slightly disapointed with the fact that his son will be the one to inherit everything. He doesn't feel that Hademar is not worthy, having never been in a battle.</p><p>Meanwhile Hademar's son, Heller, visits a leper prisoner. The prisoner claims he is not a leper but rather Heller's muse. The two have had several conversations. The leper appears to be Helmut Zemo, somehow trasported back in time.</p><p>In Modern day, Volker speaks with Reed Richards about the theory that Zemo is still alive. It seems that a group of students in Germany have come up with proof that Zemo is, in fact, still alive but perhaps lost in time.</p><p>In 1503, as Helmut Zemo continues his conversations with Heller, Zemo is beginning to plant the seed into his mind about what makes a good leader versus a good ruler. Hademar is outraged and kills Heller's two guards as a lesson.</p><p>As Harbin Zemo passes away, Hademar prepares for his coronation. He immediatley increases the tariffs and demands a virgin each night for the first month of his reign.</p><p>Upon further discussion with Zemo, Heller decides to take the Barony for himself with the aid of his loyal guards. Hademar is killed.</p><p>As Heller returns to the dungeon to visit Zemo, all he finds are empty chains.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Since the destruction of the Hellmouth, the Slayers--newly legion--have gotten organized and are kicking some serious undead butt. But not everything's fun and firearms, as an old enemy reappears and Dawn experiences some serious growing pains . . .</p><p>Buffy creator Joss Whedon brings Buffy back to Dark Horse in this direct follow-up to season seven of the smash-hit TV series.</p><p>Season 8 of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> picks up after the end of the television series.</p><p>The world has been changed by the Scooby Gang's actions the previous year. While launching an attack on an old church (mysteriously protected by a force-field), Buffy reveals that there are now over eighteen hundred Slayers around the world, five hundred of which work for Buffy in military-like squads. There are even two decoy \"Buffys\" - one literally underground and one in Rome (a reference to the \"Buffy\" seen in Season 5 of the <i>Angel</i> TV show).</p><p>Before Buffy's squad enters the church, we are introduced to Buffy's \"watcher\" - Xander Harris. Xander (jokingly refering to himself as \"Sergeant Fury\" due to the eye-patch he wears over his missing left eye) has been positioned as a leader of the Slayers - he is seen to be monitoring the squads' actions from their headquarters in Scotland.</p><p>An incident occurs with one of the less experienced squads in Barcelona when they discover that the nest of vampires they were to attack is larger than they anticipated. Xander gives the order for Andrew's squad to assist them, indicating in the process that Andrew has become some sort of leader within their organisation.</p><p>Buffy leads her team into the church, only to be confronted by three large demons - and some dead bodies. Her team quickly defeat the demons, but are shocked to discover that the bodies they found had apparently come looking for the demons and set up the force-field. The bodies were also marked with an unknown symbol, apparently self-inflicted.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the Slayers, their actions were being watched by a mysterious person floating high above the run-down church.</p><p>Meanwhile, it would appear the United States military have become interested in the Slayers' actions also. A General Voll labels the Slayers \"an army\" as he flies in to investigate the crater that was once Sunnydale, California. An investigation has been set up to look at the crater. A man has been sent underground into the ruins to explore, and declares the place empty just before he is grabbed by a pair of hands.</p><p>Back in Scotland, Buffy and Xander have no idea what the symbol that was found on the bodies means, if anything. One thing Xander knows, however, is that Buffy needs to be more sisterly towards Dawn.</p><p>Buffy goes to speak to Dawn about her problems, one of which is that she has grown to a gigantic size. Dawn however, refuses to speak to anyone but the currently missing Willow, telling Buffy only that \"Kenny never said he was a Thricewise\". Buffy knows that Dawn had sex with Kenny, but does not discuss it with her.</p><p>In a military hospital, General Voll comes to inquire about \"Subject One\" and her \"boyfriend\". Subject One is the person that was found under the Sunnydale crater, and they have agreed to help the military take down Buffy. In a surprising twist, it is revealed that Subject One is Amy, a powerful witch who was both friend and enemy to the Scooby Gang in the past.</p>",

He immediately sends a message to Batman for his help. The victim appears to have died from a gunshot and his ring detects that no one has come or gone in that area of space since the victim died. Batman is able to correctly identify the victim's characteristic as he is currently looking at an identical body in the Batcave. It turns out that sixty-two similar corpses have been found at other places like Atlantis, the Daily Planet, and the Flash museum. It also seems that whatever happens to one body has similar effects on the others. Batman recognizes the casino logo on the victim's shirt and decides that he and Hal are taking a roadtrip to Vegas. Just then they are attacked by an alien being. As the beast is eventually defeated, two spectators appear to have wagered on who would be the one to defeat the beast.</p> <p>As Bruce Wayne and Hal Jordan enter the casino, Bruce uses his charm and reputation to get information.

Facing an enemy who can absorb his cosmic power, will Terrax assume the fearsome role of The Tamer once again…or has the trauma of his enslavement broken his once-mighty spirit?</em></p><p><em>PLUS! Stardust is dead. But what was he? Who was he? And is he really gone? Find out in this all-new tale featuring Galactus’ newest herald!</em></p><p><b>PARASITES</b></p><p>Following the downfall of Annihilus, Terrax and Paibok, the Power Skrull, find themselves no longer at the mercy of his followers. Enraged with being enslaved, Terrax uses his power to destroy the ship they're on, not really thinking about the fact they are still in space.</p><p>The ship crashed on a nearby planet and they were pulled from the wreckage by Chandra, a female Centaurian. It seems the entire planet is under the rule of Randau, the Space Pirate. Randau feeds off the life force of others. He has conquored the planet and feeds off the populace. Any ship that ventures near the planet is shot down with his solar scepter. Terrax vows to take down Randau.</p><p>The fight against Randau doesn't go the way Terrax thought it would. He allowed Randau to absorb some of his power cosmic, thinking it would be too much for him. The power just makes him stronger. When Chandra leads a little army against Randau, he merely blasts her with his sceptor leaving scattered bones as remains.</p><p>Terrax realizes that he cannot use the power cosmic against him, shuts off the energy to his axe and slices Randau in two down the middle.</p><p>With the planet liberated, the residents become restless saying that Randau protected them. They ask if Terrax will rule in his place. Disgusted with their desire to be slaves, he deems the planet is not worthy of life. With one powerful swing of his axe, he causes the planet to deconstruct. Paibok survives, with the help of an alien, Delinquent. Terrax informs them it would be wise if their paths do not cross again.</p><p><b>A DEATH OF HOPE</b></p><p>After fighting against Annihilus, Stardust manages to rebuild his shattered form by using the power cosmic. He finds himself in the Andromeda Galaxy and makes his way back. On his way, he is stopped by three fellow Ethereals who demand Stardust answer for his crimes. The Annihilation Wave destroyed their civilization and Stardust chose to fight along side the <em>corporeals</em> and <em>their</em> war. They begin to fight against him and he unleashes his power.</p><p>With the last of his people reduced to ash, he absorbs them into to them to preserve what is left. Stardust soon finds his way to Galactus. Galactus is still somewhat weak from being captured and manipulated by Thanos and feeding off of beings from the Negative Zone. With his herald, the Silver Surfer, away on urgent business, Stardust asks to become Galactus' herald once again. Galactus says he has no need for him and says he is not loyal enough. To prove himself, Stardust allows Galactus to feed off of him devouring the last of his race.</p><p>He now sees that having two heralds could be a good thing. Galactus knows that one day the Silver Surfer will betray him once more and wants to be able to call upon Stardust if necessary.</p>",

This all-new special written by Brian Bendis, especially for modern legend Marc Silvestri, debuts the all new IRON MAN, OMEGA FLIGHT, MIGHTY AVENGERS, NEW AVENGERS and with a special chapter written by Warren Ellis...THUNDERBOLTS! Each chapter is an important all-new prologue for each of these huge new series and sets up the radically altered landscape that makes up the post-Civil War Marvel Universe!</em></p><p>Reed Richards does a preliminary interview with Michael Pointer, aka The Collective. He is soon questioned by another man who asks if Xorn is in his body. He shows him the footage from when the Collective destroyed Alpha Flight. Pointer pleads to stop seeing the footage. He says that because he is a mutant that can absorb others' powers, he couldn't help absorbing Xorn and all the powers. He says he would do anything to make things right. That is just what the man wanted to hear. He then reveals himself to be Walter Langkowski, Sasquatch, the only survivor of Alpha Flight. Reed Richards designed a suit to control his powers. After he does some training, he will honor the memories of those he killed by becoming a member of Canada's new super hero team, Omega Flight.</p><p>Iron Man switches his cameras to watch the Thunderbolts take brutally bring in an unregistered hero named Hurricane. He never stands a chance.</p><p>Iron Man arrives at Stark Tower. He finds Ms. Marvel. She tells Stark about a run in she had with Spider-Woman. Ms. Marvel gave an assist when Spider-Woman was fighting the Grey Gargoyle. She tried talking Jessica into joining their side. Jessica asked how she could be with Stark since Captain America is dead because of her. Ms. Marvel tells her that he is not dead. She says that he is tucked away on the raft and that they are trying to save him as they speak. She also tells Jessica that Nick Fury could come work with them too. Jessica doesn't buy it. She knows Stark hates her. Carol allows her to leave. Stark is not happy with that decision. He says he'll have her arrested for treason if she shows up again.</p><p>Stark then talks to Jarvis. Jarvis tells him that both he and the world need the Avengers. With all the super heroes at his disposal, he has the opportunity to hand pick his team. Stark looks over his files to see who would be best suited.</p>",

Two of the Marvel heroes most affected by the shocking conclusion of the war get together one last time. What is said between them will set the course of the Marvel Universe for years to come. This is the confession. Alex Maleev unveils another new fantastic art style especially for this very emotional issue.</em></p><p>Iron Man arrives on a S.H.I.E.L.D. hellicarrier. He prepares to meet with a captive on board. He begins to tell his side of the story as to why everything happened the way it did. He says it's because of King Arthur. He and Doctor Doom had been transported back in time in and he got to meet him. He knew then that they'd be at war someday. He did what he had to do. Even if it meant fighting against friends. He was willing to go all the way. It turns out he was wrong. The worst thing that could happen did. And now, there is one thing that he can never tell anyone. It was the one thing he should've said. \"It wasn't worth it.\" It turns out, he was speaking to the dead body of Captain America.</p><p>In a second story, Captain America is being taken to Ryker's Island maximum security penitentiary. Sitting in a prison specially design against him, Iron Man shows up. Captain America goes off on Iron Man. He tells him that he was the one that made the war happen. After everything he's done, all the death and destruction, the compromises of working with villains, he asks him if it was worth it. Iron Man just tells him he's a sore loser and leaves.</p><p>It can be assumed that this story takes place prior to the first one, before Captain America is killed.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The Madman universe has imploded, turning itself inside out. This brand new series is going to do the same to your brain and leave you begging for more! If you've never experienced this legendary Mike Allred creation, now's the perfect time to jump on this all-new thrill ride that begins with Frank 'Madman' Einstein facing his most terrifying challenge yet, as his entire existence is in question-in fact, ALL existence!! This story will also include an innovative recap of every essential event in the Madman mythos. Future issues in the series will take you to the most wondrous places a comic book can offer. Climb aboard and dig the ride!</em></p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p>Madman finds himself in a world where everyone is dead. Searching everywhere, he comes across Warren, one of Dr. Gillespie's helper drones. Warren says all the death is because of Madman. He tells him to go back to the beginning to recall the events that lead to this. Madman can recall when he \"died\" and was brought back by Dr. Gillespie and Professor Boiffard. They were the ones that rehabilitated him and gave him the name Frank Einstein. This was also when he discovered that he had psychic abilities that allowed him to know all of a person's secrets just by touching them. He immediately fell for Joe, Gillespie and Boiffard's research assistant. Soon, Frank created a new identity inspired by his childhood hero, Mr. Excitement to help his self esteem. He went on many adventures helping out Gillespie with different experiments.</p><p>Warren continues to press Madman. He thinks back to Astroman, a clone robot made from his brain cells. When Astroman was asked to reveal the memories of Frank's past life, he blew his circuits. Frank knows that he was a Tri-Eye Agent and that he wasn't a \"good man.\" He also knows that he's been given a second chance to be a better person.</p><p>Things come crashing down and Frank can barely handle it. He is told that he is one of the four. When it is time, \"the four horseman will ride.\" He is told that he knows a lot about life and death, heaven and hell, he has traveled through time and across dimensions. He just doesn't know anything about himself. He is told that perhaps everything that has happened is only a figment of his imagination. He is reminded of how cruel he was. How easily he could kill. Perhaps everything he remembers about trying to redeem himself never really happened. He is everything and nothing. He is all alone.</p>",

But what happens when a legendary assassin takes aim at the Danger Girls themselves?</em>                         <br/></p>In Yokohama, Japan, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17820\" href=\"/abbey-chase/4005-17820/\" slug=\"abbey-chase\">      Abbey Chase</a> is on a mission to recover a piece of weapons technology from an old friend, Mr. Naoki. As she's about to meet with him, she recieves word that a change of plans has been made and she is also to bring him along. When she lets him know that he is to go with her, his bodyguards enter the room to deal with her threats. Grabbing Naoki, Abbey jumps out the window as the guards open fire. Using a parachute, they safely land on a waiting speed boat driven by Sydney. They ask him for the technology. He says he will be killed when \"they\" find out it's been taken. Then a sniper shoots and kills Naoki. The bullet hit him in the chest where he had the tech in his jacket pocket. <p>In Melborne, Australia, the girls are supposed to have a day off when <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17825\" href=\"/sydney-savage/4005-17825/\" slug=\"sydney-savage\">     Sydney Savage</a> calls Abbey asking her to go to her location.

Abbey fears that Sydney is thinking of quitting <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40975\" href=\"/danger-girl/4060-40975/\" slug=\"danger-girl\">    Danger Girl</a> because of the sniper.

Valerie is able to digitize a replica so that she can grab some of the code that is on the disk. It turns out that the tech has the blueprints to build the Master Key. The Master Key is apparently a weapong that \"every bad guy in the world has always wanted.\"</p> <p>In the Arctic Circle, a nuclear sub has been accessed by an outside source. The missles have been commanded to self-detonate. The crew abandons ship as the sub is blown up.<br/></p> <p>Now that event has happened, every nation in the world will want the Master Key. Danger Girl is given a new mission to find and destroy it.</p> <p>In Madagascar, the man responsible for detonating the nuclear sub tells his computer guy to program the Master Key to destroy their next target. He is hesitant because he fears the signal will be traced to them. The man says that no one will be able to trace them to this location just as they are found by a British agent. He asks for the key as he is shot by a sniper. The same sniper that killed Naoki. The man tells her that more will most likely arrive. He gives her a picture of Abbey warning her to be careful as she is supposedly the best there is. The sniper says she looks forward to meeting her.</p>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>(Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California)</p><p>Julie Power (Lightspeed, of Power Pack) stands on the roof of the Hyatt Hotel, telling Phil Urich (the heroic Green Goblin) on the phone that she can't go on like this. Phil is begging her not to do it; they've come too far for her to just throw it all away. Julie replies that he did the best he could, and she appreciates it, but this is her choice. She says she's tired of living a lie. As Julie walks to the edge, Phil desperately begs her to stop, telling her that she can get all the help she needs. Julie, saying goodbye, hangs up and falls over the edge.</p><p>Julie manages to fly herself to safety, and it is revealed that Julie wasn't contemplating suicide at all; only asking Phil if she could use her powers (something Excelsior isn't fond of). Mickey Musashi (Turbo from the New Warriors) asks Phil what pushed her over the edge – no pun intended. Phil is miserable – Julie had been doing so well, not using her powers. Mickey asks what building she jumped off and Phil tells her it was the Hyatt. Mickey is shocked – the Hyatt is just a block away, so why couldn’t she resist temptation? Phil replies that tall buildings get her every time, and says that she should learn to keep her powers to herself or risk endangering her entire family. Phil says that if the Civil War was good for anything, it showed them how important it is, now more than ever, to keep their powers to themselves – to stay out of costume. Mickey agrees with him, and suggests they go find Julie. It’s time for an intervention.</p><p>(Holy Trinity Church - Excelsior meeting)</p><p>In the basement, Johnny Gallo (Ricochet from the Slingers) leans over a chair lazily. Chris Powell (Darkhawk) sits beside him, comfortably. Mattie Franklin (Spider-Woman III) sits tensely beside Phil who is looking at his watch. Johnny complains about meeting in the Church basement and Mickey replies that the reason they meet there is to remind themselves about the point of their group: namely to abandon their powers. Johnny makes a sarcastic remark, to which Mickey replies with a harsh comeback. Phil warns her to calm down. He suggests that, even though Julie hasn’t arrived yet, they should start the meeting. Mickey then turns to Mattie and says that it is her turn.</p><p>Reluctantly, Mattie gets up and dives into her story: she was the third Spider-Woman, or 'the Young One' as some of them remind her. She explains that her powers pretty much destroyed her life. “That’s something they don’t tell you when you put on the tights. Become a super hero. Fight crime. Save lives. Every life but your own, that is.” One day, Mattie was out there, minding her own business, and the next thing she knew, dope-dealing junkies drug her and keep her hostage while they pick her apart, stealing some of her skin and blood in order to adopt her powers. What really horrified Mattie later, was that she found out that they didn’t even know what her powers were. She was nothing but the next high to them. After being violated like that, Mattie had no desire to ever use her powers again. They disgusted her. Just being in New York made her sick which was the main reason she came to Los Angeles to hook up with Excelsior. As Mattie cries, she reveals that the reason she joined the group was to be around people who understand that super-powers can be as much of a curse as a blessing. Mickey gets up to comfort her, but that is when Julie Power enters the room.</p><p>Julie, who was talking on the phone to her brother, Alex, ends the conversation by saying, “Don’t worry, Alex, I know what I’m doing. I’ll tell them when I think the time’s right.” Julie then apologizes for being late, but Mickey cuts her off by snapping, “When the time’s right for what?” Embarrassed, Julie says that she wants to tell her parents of her wish to be an actress. Phil reminds everyone what Julie did today; Julie apologizes for that as well, saying she 'needed to let her hair down a bit.' Mickey snaps back harshly. “Let your hair down? Is that what she calls jumping off a hotel on Sunset Boulevard in broad daylight? Who’s her hairstylist, Daredevil?\"</p><p>Phil tells Mickey to calm down. Getting up, he tells Julie the purpose of their group is to try and put their powers behind them. Their reasons and motives may vary, but they have to support each other. Phil informs her that because of her 'aerial joyride,' they can barely trust her. Chris then asks why they even bother reprimanding her; it’s in through one ear and out the other with Tinkerbell. Johnny immediately turns to him, warning him to watch his mouth. Julie, however, tells him to forget it. She’s a big girl who can fight her own battles.</p><p>Julie then dives into her speech. Unlike the other members, Julie got her powers when she was a little girl. She’s had them as long as she can remember. They’re part of who she is: as much a part of her life as walking and talking. She turns to the others. Chris found the Darkhawk amulet when he was a teenager, and could give himself the dark force powers whenever he chooses. Mickey’s powers come from her costume; no powers, no Turbo. The same goes for Phil, who only became the Green Goblin after donning one of the masks his predecessor left behind to become a hero. Johnny, as a mutant, must understand what she is going through, but even so, his ricochet abilities only developed in college. She turns to Mattie and says that even though she’s sorry for what happened to her, Mattie hasn’t been at this as long as they have. Julie then begins to complain about how they had normal lives before it began, unlike her. Crying heavily, Julie begs them not to blame her for simply being herself.</p><p>Mickey rushes to Julie and apologizes, but Chris says, \"And the academy award goes to...\" - earning him a punch from Johnny. Phil, standing up, says he understands what she is going through, however, as the world around them is still changing, he advises her that self-sacrifice is the new order of the day. This angers Mattie. \"Self-sacrifice?\" Angrily, she shows the rest of the room her four, long, arching Spider-legs emerging from her back. \"Self-sacrifice?\" Mattie says she may not have had her powers as long as they have, but this is what passes as normal for her. This is what she's forced to live with. She has to fight to conceal those things, and the pressure on her back is a constant reminder of what power she has. Mattie, angry, snaps at Julie, saying that just because 'she hasn't been at this nearly as long,' she doesn't know what it's like to have powers that affect your everyday life. Leaving the room, she suggests that they try walking a mile on her extra legs. Chris immediately jumps up, and races after her, chasing her outside. Mattie then turns and gives him a little smirk. \"You think they bought it?\" she asks.</p><p>Chris is stunned - Mattie's anger was all an act. Julie isn't the only actress in the group. Chris asks why Mattie did that, and Mattie explains. Joining Excelsior was the only way her step-dad would allow her to move here. Chris asks if she even follows the group's real mission: to not use their powers and adapt to a normal civilian life. Mattie does believe in what they are trying to accomplish, however, things have changed for her. She holds up her Spider-Woman costume and mentions that she still is attached to her superhero life. Chris asks what made her want to put the suit back on, and she tells him of how her past caught up with her. His and her past, actually. Chris is confused. His past? Mattie explains: the Daily Bugle had published a story about him (as Darkhawk), selling his blood to junkies and letting them get high. Mattie tells him this is his chance: if he could put his Darkhawk costume back on, he could take down some dealers and clear his name by proving Darkhawk really is a hero. Mattie reveals the reason she put her costume back on was that she found the Mutant Growth Hormone dealers who abused her, here in LA. That's why she wanted to move here. She learned that the MGH Dealers had moved from New York (which was going crazy) and arrived here in LA, because the Pride were no longer around.</p><p>Mattie invites Chris to clear his and her name at the same time. Right now. Fingering his Darkhawk amulet, he says a quick night of crime-fighting shouldn't hurt. Changing into Darkhawk, he asks if this should stay a secret between both of them. She agrees; after all, what they don't know won't hurt them. As the two of them fly off to stop the drug dealers, Johnny watches from below, murmuring \"And the academy award goes to... Mattie Franklin, it looks like\".</p><p>(Downtown, Los Angeles)</p><p>Darkhawk and Spider-Woman arrive at the warehouses where the MGH dealers have their base of operations. Darkhawk suggests they should go into a full-frontal fight, though Spider-Woman wants to see what they're up against. Darkhawk ignores her, and goes into a full-frontal fight anyway. Mattie sighs. She had to pick the 'unstable one.' Her luck with men never changes. Inside, Darkhawk has already knocked out half the MGH dealers by the time Spider-Woman arrives. Just after they defeat every dealer, Darkhawk notices a woman on a bed in the corner. Horrified, he rushes up to see that she is a mutant, and the MGH dealers are taking her blood. Just before Darkhawk saves her, the woman jumps up and reveals herself to be Nekra, vampire-like mutant. As it turns out, Nekra was willingly giving her blood. Darkhawk and Spider-Woman begin to engage her in battle, with Spider-Woman sardonically remarking that she thought vampires were supposed to take blood, not give it. It is at this moment that Ricochet arrives, having followed them ever since their meeting.</p><p>While fighting Nekra, Ricochet tells Spider-Woman and Darkhawk that they were losing the fight terribly, though Darkhawk says they're a little out of practice. Spider-Woman, however, is angry that Ricochet followed them. Ricochet shoots one of his disks in Nekra's eyes, Spider-Woman grabs her with her legs and Darkhawk blasts a purple energy ray from his amulet at Nekra. Finally, the villain collapses to the ground. Spider-Woman looks around the warehouse and finds a folder about Nekra. Apparently, she is a mutant whose body produces 'neo-adrenaline,' which means the more worked up she gets, the stronger she becomes. The MGH dealers were paying her a fortune for her blood. Worse, Spider-Woman finds out the MGH dealers have a big revolving door of donors. She is angry. While Excelsior has been ignoring their powers, the MGH dealers have been turning a minor business into a company. After much deliberation, the three of them (Spider-Woman, Darkhawk, and Ricochet) decide to continue wearing their superhero costumes to look into this company further. Ricochet asks if they should get the others involved, but Spider-Woman suggests that they should keep this secret between themselves... besides, what they don't know won't hurt them.</p><p>Back at Excelsior's meeting, Julie, Mickey and Phil stare at the three empty chairs. After a silence, Julie asks, \"Think they're coming back?\"</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage of the movie poster for <em>The Breakfast Club</em>.</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>Hulk is coming and no power on Earth can stop him from getting revenge on the Illuminati! What events have led up to the super-human battle-to-end-all-battles? As Hulk’s great stone ship approaches the planet, he prepares for the war on the horizon by reliving past conflicts with Iron Man, The Fantastic Four, Doctor Strange and the Inhumans. This is the perfect jumping-on point for this summer’s super hero-smashing, city-leveling, bone-crushing, Marvel history-making event!</i></p><p>The Hulk and his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-43240\" href=\"/warbound/4060-43240/\">  Warbound</a> crew fly through space towards Earth. Hulk stands on the outside of the ship like a hood ornament. A species of space scavengers see the ship and decide they must have it. They figured taking the ship and killing everyone on board would be no problem. They were wrong.  Hulk tears them apart. As he fights, beats, and slashes at them, he's seeing the Illuminati in his mind: Mr. Fantastic, Dr. Strange, Iron Man, and Black Bolt. One by one, he dispatches the \"Illuminati\" until the aliens are gone.  Two of his War-bound come out to join him, Brood and Korg. Hulk is so enraged, he still sees his enemy. He grabs Brood by the neck and is about to go for the kill when he realizes what is happening. Hulk is ashamed for the first time in his life.</p><p>On Earth, Jennifer Walters walks into her motel room to find Doc Samson waiting in there. She's not too happy to see him even if the last time she did, she punched him across the state. She cannot believe that he's working against Hulk and using their friendship to meet Reed Richards wishes.</p><p>On the ship, the War-bound are concerned that Hulk almost killed Brood and Korg. They are not sure if he will be able to tell the difference between them and his enemies when the battle comes. Hiroim says he will deal with it and leaves them.</p><p>Hulk wants to be left alone but Hiroim persists. He says they must speak.  He talks to him of his anger and trying to focus on his enemies, to use his anger as an asset. If he can control it, he can use it to destroy all his enemies. That's music to Hulk's ears.</p><p>Jennifer and Samson continue to talk. She is upset that Tony Stark and Reed have simply sent her cousin off planet without giving him a trial. She mentions, Casus Belli,\" which is Latin for \"the incident that provides a reason for going to war.\" She says when Hulk gets back, it's going to be trouble.  Samson says he's not coming back. He mentions that it was Hulk that first started the \"war\" when he attacked the Fantastic Four (when they were called in to investigate a saboteur).</p><p>On the ship, Hulk and Hiroim meditate and Hulk tells of the same encounter with the Fantastic Four. He mentions that Richards was a colleague of Banner's. Richards was so smug and just wanted to take Hulk down. He was the one to take down the saboteur but the Fantastic Four got the credit.</p><p>Next the talk on Earth goes to Iron Man and how Tony Stark tired to find him a cure and risked his life to deal with Hulk when the cure failed. Hulk mentions to Hiroim that Stark has always hated him from the beginning. He quickly believed that the Hulk was causing trouble when Loki tricked the Avengers and when Space Phantom pulled the same stunt.<br /></p><p>Eventually they talk of Black Bolt. Hulk says that he is the only one that could stop him with his voice. Hiroim gets the idea that they need to take Black Bolt out first and wave him around to the others so they know that Hulk will not be stopped.</p><p>Jennifer finally tells Samson to leave. She says she will not help them when he returns and starts World War Hulk. Then she gets a sudden premonition and somehow knows that he actually is on his way.</p><p>A humorous tale of a secret meeting of the Illuminators (as Hawkeye calls them) in the kitchen of the Avengers. They discuss sending Hulk off planet.  Namor is against the idea (and maybe Black Bolt is, either that or he wants to play rock-paper-scissors). Namor is finally able to convince them that it would be bad karma until the Hulk arrives and eats his sandwich.  Hulk is sent out and lands on Sakaar. Eventually he is headed back to Earth.</p><p>Amadeus Cho is speaking with a women, Agent Sexton, who wants to bring him in. He says he doesn't trust her because she just blew up his house. She says it was the enemy. Because he is the seventh smartest person alive, they want him working for them. He says he can't trust her at this time. She says to take his time and stay out of site while she proves he can trust her.</p><p>Cho is in a diner when the waitress discovers he has a coyote pup (whose mother was just hit by a car) in his jacket. There was a news report about him on the television too and a man eating at the counter seems to be taking an interest in the exchange between Cho and a an officer.</p><p>The officer makes a grab for him and Cho makes his own move. He blasts his music player, spits a lemon seed at the officer through a straw, throws pepper in his face and topples a shelf of pies. He heads outside and hops on his scooter. The officer calls for backup saying he was the kid on the television. A copter begins to chase him so he angles his side mirror to blind them. A missile was released from the copter heading towards the man who was at the counter.</p><p>When the dust from the explosion clears, the Hulk is coming out of the crater created. Standing over Cho, the kid tries telling Hulk it wasn't his fault. Hulk says he knows. He picks up another missile that hadn't exploded and throws it back at the copter.</p><p>Later Amadeus and Hulk are off alone. Cho has to eat after \"thinking that hard\" and Hulk asks him what Banner said to him at the diner. Cho tells him he said, \"Don't be stupid.\" Hulk says that Banner is weak, not like them. As Hulk leaves, Amadeus calls Agent Sexton. Behind her are screens showing outside the diner. She tells him it \"wasn't them.\" He says he doesn't care but he's coming for them.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>At last—witness the birth of the Marvel Zombies as told by the creative team of the best-selling limited series! Kirkman and Phillips pull out all the stops as they reveal the secret story of the day the Marvel Heroes became brain-eating monsters! Want to see the Avengers eat Jarvis? You won’t get that in this month’s New Avengers, effendi! And we dare you to pry your eyes away from Arthur Suydam’s top-secret double-gatefold zombified homage to a classic 1990's cover you don't want to miss.</p><p>Spider-Man rushes home. He tells Aunt May and MJ that he was bitten by Colonel America. He doesn't feel too good. Aunt May goes to get some peroxide as MJ rushes to Peter's side when he bends over in pain. He cannot control himself or his hunger. When Aunt May walks out, she sees Peter eating Mary Jane. He asks her to lock herself in the bathroom because he cannot control himself. The Marvel Zombies are on the loose in New York City.</p><p>Above Earth in Asteroid M, Magneto and Fabian Cortez talk. Magneto blames himself for what has happened. He tried making a deal to lower the number of homo sapiens so mutants would have a fighting chance. He didn't realize that the virus affects both humans and mutants. Magneto decides he must go to Earth and try to save some people. He tells Cortez to stay and monitor the situation. Asteroid M might be the only refuge they'll have.</p><p>Back in New York, Nova comes looking for Peter. He's concerned with all the \"crazy stuff\" going on and wanted to make sure he and his family were okay. Spider-Man is saying there's not enough to share. He tells Nova not to look at him and forces him out through the window. As Spider-Man tries to bite Nova, Daredevil comes from behind. He says they have to kill Spider-Man. Nova can't kill his friend and Spider-Man manages to take a bite out of Daredevil.</p><p>Elsewhere, Colonel America orders the Avengers to stop. He tells them to look at themselves. He says there may be a cure.</p><p>In Westchester, New York, the X-Men are fighting zombie Alpha Flight. Cyclops tells his team that they have to keep fighting them despite the fact that they keep coming. They can't let the zombies inside to get at the students. Suddenly, the Alpha Flight zombies are hit in the head by metal objects, crushing their skulls. Magneto has arrived to help. He tells them they cannot show mercy. It's kill or be killed. The X-Men are surprised to find out that there's more of these creatures.</p><p>In New York City, Hank Pym (Giant Man) and Black Panther are running to Hank's lab. They are surprised as to how quickly the hunger got to Colonel America. They are hoping they'll be able to come up with a cure when Black Panther notices that Hank's been bitten. Hank grows to a giant size and smashes Black Panther. He says he doesn't want to be caught without a meal when the hunger strikes. He figures with the way the others are eating, the food supply will be gone soon. He drags Black Panther back to his lab.</p><p>The zombies continue to attack the innocent. At the Baxter Building, She-Hulk has just attacked Franklin and Valeria. The Fantastic Four is saddened that they let their guard down. They thought they were safe there. She-Hulk knew the codes to get in and ate the kids. Sue is so upset that she creates an invisible bubble inside She-Hulk's head and expands it. Reed gets a call from Nick Fury. They make their way to a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier and meet up with Thor and Nova on the way. Inside is the resistance. Nick explains everything to all the surviving heroes gathered. He says it's too late to be contained but they still might be able to reverse it. Nova says they're crazy. They're already outnumbered. Nick says the only other option is to give up.</p><p>Hank makes his way back to the Avengers' Mansion. He finds Colonel America, Black Widow, Ms. Marvel, Luke Cage, Wasp, and Hawkeye all feasting on poor Jarvis. Around the world, the last few uninfected heroes fight against the zombies.</p><p>On the helicarrier, Sue finds Reed working alone. He seems to be admiring a dead Guardian zombie. He says he is amazed that the infection turns them into efficient life forms. He says the changes almost seem to be improvements on the human form. Sue is disgusted and has to leave. Elsewhere on the helicarrier, Tony Stark tells Nick that they may have no choice but to transport the survivors into the Negative Zone for their safety.</p><p>Outside the heroes are getting overwhelmed. More and more are getting bitten and infected. On the helicarrier, Reed calls in the resto of the Fantastic Four. He says they should just give in. He's already infected them with a scratch. They begin to hunger and Reed allows them to attack him in order to infect himself. They come across Stark and Fury by the teleporter to the Negative Zone. Reed tells them to infect Stark but not to eat him completely. Nick prepares to teleport himself along with Nightcrawler, Colossus, Storm, Dr. Strange, and Thor. Then he realizes that since the virus came from another world, they run the risk of taking it with them.</p><p>Once they've all been infected, Reed tells the others that now is the time to try to rebuild the teleporter and find another dimension in order to find more food.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage of the Jim Lee cover of <em><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/x-men-1-rubicon/4000-34784/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-34784\">X-Men #1</a></em>.</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>With the thrill of the summer's biggest blockbuster still fresh in your young minds, Marvel brings you the story of how it all </p><p>started for one of Spider-Man's greatest villains in SANDMAN: YEAR ONE. Plus a very special back-up story by Colleen Doran.</p><p><b>Sandman: Year One</b></p><p>The story of William Baker.  Growing up without a father and a mother that drank, young Billy loved time spent at the beach.  He would build sand sculptures while his mother passed out from drinking.  Waiting for her to wake up to show her his masterpiece, he falls asleep next to her.  Soon it starts to rain.  When he drags her over to his sand palace, the rain has already begun to destroy it.  He becomes determined to make something that will last.</p><p>In middle school, William becomes more talented at his sculptures.  He has grown a fondness for his art teacher, Miss Flint.  One day he notices that she has a new ring on her finger.  She has  become engaged and he asks if he has money.  This throws her off but lets William know that it's guys with money that get the girl.  As she leaves for lunch duty, the school bully and his buddies come in, smash William's sculptures then proceed to smash on him.  He sneaks away from school and goes home.  His mom blames herself for William getting beat up.  She says if she was a better wife, his father wouldn't have left and he'd have someone to teach him to defend himself.  William says that he is a man and will show everyone that he can defend himself.<br /></p><p>Spending more time at the beach, he observes how the sand changes shape with the water.  He sees how others are simply knock back by the waves.  He spends the next month practicing moving like sand and water.  At school he easily takes out the bully, Vic, and his two friends.  Even though he gets in trouble, he has gained a new level of respect and a feeling of enjoyment over hurting others.</p><p>Everyone learns to follow William.  Vic and his friends continue to stand behind him.  He no longer goes by William.  He takes on the name \"Flint\" as a reminder of the weak child he was.  Still having lots of anger inside, he takes it out on the football field.  Late one night, Vic comes to him telling him he's in over his head with his gambling debts.  He started betting with the mob in order to get bigger payouts.  They say they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay.  Vic suggests Flint throws the next couple footbal games so they can make the money back.    Finally, Flint agrees.</p><p>It becomes obvious to the coach that he threw the game.  He asked Flint if he had money on the game but kicked him off the team before he could answer.  Then the coach says he's going to try to get him expelled.    The coach says he thougth Flint was going to leave a mark on the world.  Flint leaves a mark as he beats the coach with his football helmut.<br /></p><p>Flint and Vic turn to a life of crime.  Robbing a store, they are chased by the police.  Flint gets caught but doesn't turn in Vic.  He goes to jail where he meets his father, Floyd Baker.  Trying to show off for him, Floyd is impressed with Flint's punch and says he's nothing like what his son must be like.  Flint introduces himself as \"Flint Marko\" thinking about what his coach said.</p><p>Flint kept going in and out of prison.  One day he was in prison but his father wasn't there so he decided to escape.  He swam his way to a beach where a nuclear reactor detonated.  The Sandman was born.</p><p>Returning to his girl's place, he found Vic in bed with her.  Using his new powers, he attacks them almost killing them both.  He decided that they weren't worth it.  He wanted enemies that were good enough for him and found one with Spider-Man.  He claims that he allowed Spider-Man to capture him with a vacuum cleaner on their first encounter.  Returning to prison, he broke free with his father.</p><p>They battle at the boardwalk.  He begins tearing apart the amusement park, throwing pieces at Spider-Man.  Throwing a roller coaster car at him, Spider-Man dodges it and it seems to smash his father.  Sandman becomes enraged and mixes himself with the sand from the beach to increase his size.  He gets struck by lightning and gets blown apart.</p><p>Spider-Man pulls off the roller coaster car.  Sandman's father is still alive.  Spider-Man couldn't stop the car but was able to make a web cushion before it hit him.  He asks him why he was with Sandman.  Floyd says he doesn't know who he was, he was just asking for directions to a bar.  He walks away.</p><p>Later on the beach, a young child finds a huge sand sculpture.  Admiring it, he sees an image of Sandman holding an unconscious Spider-Man over his head.  Sandman says to himself that the \"Death of Spider-Man\" will be his masterpiece and that it will last forever.</p><p><b>Leah</b></p><p>A touching story of a young sick homeless girl that has a love for Spider-Man. The ending will not be revealed here...</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p> <p>The latest offering from the Marvel Knights line. Guest-starring the Fantastic Four!</p> <p>For untold years Norrin Radd has surfed the galaxy, exploring the darkness between stars, witnessing the rise and fall of vast civilizations. Now his ride is about to come to an end. It starts with a small spot -- a blemish that will spread until he is no more. Until then, the Silver Surfer would undertake his final voyage -- to the one destination that has always eluded him. His journey starts where it began.</p> <p>The Silver Surfer flies through space reflecting on everything he's seen. He heads back to Earth where Reed is working in his lab (as usual) and Ben and Johnny bicker. Johnny notices that they have a visitor waiting outside. The Silver Surfer is waiting to speak with Reed. He wants to speak to him alone but allows Sue to be there. As Ben and Johnny look back, they see a horrified look appear on Sue's face.<br /></p> <p>Reed and the Surfer have been in his lab for two days. Sue has been crying non-stop. Reed conducts painful tests repeatedly on him to be sure of the results. Later Reed is talking to Sue. It seems that the Silver Surfer's shell that has protected him from radiation and cosmic rays is deteriorating.</p> <p>The Silver Surfer reflects on when he first met Galactus. Galactus was going to feed off the energy of his home planet, Zenn-La. He managed to convince Galactus to spare the planet in return for him becoming his herald. He thinks about how his memory and conscience were erased and he had a part in the destruction and death of billions. It wasn't until they arrived at Earth, where seeing the determination of the Earthlings and the bravery of the Fantastic Four, that he decided to stand against his master.</p> <p>The Surfer tells Reed and Sue that he plans on traveling around Earth for a little bit before heading back to Zenn-La. He tells them not to be sad for him. He says that if it wasn't for meeting them, he wouldn't have re-discovered his true self.</p> <p>After he leaves, Sue asks Reed what he told the Surfer. He told him that he has three weeks, maybe a month. The Silver Surfer says that there are butterflies on Earth that only live for two weeks. To them that is a lifetime. If he has a month, that is the same as two lifetimes.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Super-powered criminals are being apprehended by a mysterious group of heroes. Someone is defacing Superhuman Registration posters. Someone is raising eyebrows all around town -- from City Hall to Tony Stark’s war chamber. And the only clue to their identity? Two spray-painted letters: N.W. Who are these mysterious young upstarts that have dared to fight the powers-that-be? And what do they want from a de-powered mutant named Sofia? Are the New Warriors truly back from the dead? Or has something new risen from the ashes of Stamford?</p><p><i>Synoposis</i></p><p>The Grey Gargoyle is on the run.</p><p>Two teammates communicate electronically with one member with a bird's eye view and the other ready to make his/her move on the ground level.</p><p>Wondra moves in on her prey and pounces on the criminal in a dark alley way. In a puff of purple smoke Wondra emerges towering over a now shrunken Grey Gargoyle, warning him to tell all his friends that, \"this is only the beginning\".</p><p>Elsewhere, Sofia Mantega roams freely in the clouds with the feathered wings of angel. As she moves past the sun she notices an ominous eye watching her from afar. Taken aback she sees the face of the Scarlet Witch, the woman who robbed the powers of 90% of the mutant population on the day now infamously known as M-Day. Sofia prepares to attack when Wanda's eyes glow with energy and fries Sofia, destroying her wings and forcing her to plummet to the ground.</p><p>Sofia awakens to an audience of curious eyes on a subway train. The traumatic event was only a nightmare yet the reality of her lost powers remains. Sofia leaves the subway and walks through New York City, taking time to notice an Uncle Sam-like poster of Iron Man promoting the Superhuman Registration Act. She looks angrily at the picture and walks away. She later meets with an old, homeless man named Sammy whom she had been visiting nearly every day. She offers him to come down to her diner to get some food.</p><p>*Sammy: <b>\"You're my guardian angel, you know that?</b>.\"*</p><p>Sammy reveals that someone had given him some money to deliver a cell phone to Sofia. On the cell phone is an ominous message for Sofia to continue her path while he taps into her MP3 player. The man just talks and hardly lets Sofia get a word in. He knows that she is a depowered mutant and that while she has tried to move on with her life, she is still very lost. He abruptly ends the conversation, greatly aggravating Sofia.</p><p>Nearby, Detective Givens and Detective Sykes find a miniature Grey Gargoyle taped to a lamp post. The two detectives, who work for the super-powered division of the NYPD in association with S.H.I.E.L.D., find a note attached to the tiny villain that reads \"NW\".</p><p>The detectives try to figure out theories as to how the Grey Gargoyle was captured, but they come up with nothing. Givens begins to move away the scraps of garbage on the ground to uncover a graffiti message on the pavement that says, \"the New Warriors were here\".</p><p>In a diner not too far away, Tony Stark's voice can be heard from a small television screen. Several customers have their eyes glued to the screen as Stark discusses a dangerous new group of vigilantes. Two men debate Tony Stark's methods for safety as Sofia walks in for work.</p><p>Sofia's boss proclaims she's late and that she's not taking the job seriously. She sasses her boss in front of the other workers and somehow her charm keeps her in her job.</p><p>One of her other co-workers, a rather large woman named Tina, tells her that her \"boyfriend\" Barry is sitting at another table waiting for her. The man had been visiting the diner for the past month and Tina suspects that he probably has an innocent crush on her.</p><p>Sofia approaches him to take his order and the two flirt and set up a date for later that night.</p><p>Later that night in Sofia's apartment as she readies for her date, a message pops up on her computer screen. The man continues to try to recruit Sofia into their cause and Sofia figures out that whoever they are they must be affiliated with the new vigilante group that are currently being hunted by the Initiative. The man tells her to break her date, but Sofia angrily protests as she had finally gotten her life back on track after losing her powers. However, the man knows that its still not what she wants. He knows that she wants something more.</p><p>Elsewhere Captain America villain Anaconda is found tied up to a lamp post by Detective Sykes and Givens. Anaconda seems to be wrapped in Spider-Man's webbing, but the true nature of her capture doesn't seem to be all that it seems.</p><p>Later that night Sofia waits to meet the man from the New Warriors. Instead, she sees Barry despite canceling their date. He asks her to come with her, but upon realizing he has something to do with the messages she slaps him across his face and prepares to leave.</p><p>Barry reveals to Sofia that they had actually known each other all along, dating back to their time with the Xavier Institute. He tells Sofia that Barry is actually short for \"Barnell Bohusk\", also known as the former mutant Beak. The two embrace and try to catch up on old times, but Barry insists on explaining what the New Warriors are about. He opens a portal and the two teleport to a large, metal building. The teleportation leaves Sofia rather woozy, but before she can regain her composure she is greeted by a man long thought dead--Night Thrasher!</p><p>Homagecover to Uncanny X-men vol.1 issue 141</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Marvel's massive summer smashfest begins! Exiled by a group of Marvel \"heroes\" to the savage alien planet of Sakaar, the Hulk raged, bled and conquered through the pages of last year's \"Planet Hulk\" epic, rising from slave to gladiator to king. Now the Hulk returns to Earth to wreak his terrible vengeance on Iron Man, Reed Richards, Dr. Strange and Black Bolt -- and anyone else who gets in his way. Stronger than ever, accompanied by his monstrous Warbound gladiator allies, and possessed by the fiercest and purest rage imaginable, the Hulk may just tear this stupid planet in half. The epic story of anger unbound begins with this special double-sized issue written by \"Planet Hulk\" scribe Greg Pak and penciled by the legendary John Romita, Jr.</em></p><p>Hulk and his Warbound arrive. First stop is the moon. As Hulk lands, he is met by Black Bolt and Medusa. She questions why he has arrived unannounced. They see he is dressed for war. She says he has faced Black Bolt before and lost. All Hulk can say is, \"You shot me into space...Killed my world...\" Medusa tells him to stop and he says \"Never.\" As he approaches, Black Bolt simply whispers, \"Enough.\" The force of his words blasts Hulk. He fights to hang on but is eventually sent flying back. They turn to head back towards their palace. Hulk comes back saying he hasn't come there for a whisper. He wants to hear Black Bolt scream and jumps towards him.</p><p>On Earth, the arrival of the Hulk's ship has been detected. They've registered that there's been an explosion on the moon. Tony Stark tries telling the President to block all the satellites but it is too late. The ship can be seen over New York City. A giant holographic message appears before everyone and on all channels. Hulk tells the \"puny humans\" that he has come to smash. He wants them to know why first. He shows them the message from Iron Man, Reed Richards, Black Bolt, and Dr. Strange about sending him into space. He tells everyone how he was sent to a planet where he could be killed and was forced to become a gladiator. He tells them about his Warbound and how he became King and had a Queen. He shows them how a bomb was sent with him and destroyed his planet and killed a million people. He gives New York City 24 hours to evacuate. He says that after that time if he does not see Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic, and Dr. Strange, he will smash the entire planet and shows the beaten pulp of Black Bolt.</p><p>Iron Man takes off. He takes over the satellites mainframes and sets them up so that Hulk cannot tap into them again. As soon as Iron Man has locked into the satellites, they hit him with a modified EMP blast through them. Doctor Strange's astral form appears before Iron Man. He mentions that Hulk's never been angrier or stronger. Iron Man asks Strange to use his magic to send him away. Dr. Strange questions that action as it would most likely result in Hulk destroying another world. They caused the problem and must solve it. He asks Tony if he wants the help of his \"comrades\" if he can resist in trying to arrest them. Stark says all unregistered heroes will get a full pardon if they turn themselves over when all of this is over. Strange says that'd be something if they could survive the Hulk's anger.</p><p>Stark and Reed Richards pay a visit to Sentry. They tell him that they need him to go to the Hulk. Robert is hesitant because they are friends. He says the last time he saw the Hulk, he was fighting the Void and got every bone in his body broke. Then he found out he was the Void. Reed tells him that he is the most powerful being in the universe and they need him, the Hulk needs him.</p><p>In Manhattan, S.H.I.E.L.D. and other assorted heroes (including Spider-Man and She-Hulk) assist in evacuating everyone. Finally they've managed to evacuate five million people in twenty-three hours. A fire chief asks Spider-Man and Ms. Marvel what is the big deal, the Hulk's been dealt with before. Ms. Marvel mentions that he's different now, especially since he smashed Black Bolt. The chief doesn't know who Black Bolt is. Spider-Man mentions that before this, he thought Black Bolt was the \"second most powerful guy in the galaxy.\" The chief says that he must be number three now.</p><p>A figure is seen flying towards them and they think it's Sentry. It turns out to be Iron Man in a huge piece of armor. Spider-Man's senses go off like crazy as Hulk's ship can be seen floating overhead. Iron Man tells them that this is his fight. He tells them not to attack until he is done with him or the Hulk is done with him. Flying towards Hulk, Hulk jumps down to meet him. The impact sends a shockwave that knocks most off their feet and smashes the windows on the surrounding buildings.</p><p>As they are engaged, Iron Man sends out a transmission. He tells everyone that he is to blame for the Hulk's anger. He says that everything he'll ever do is to protect the world. Iron Man gives Hulk a punch that sends him flying miles away. It looks like Iron Man has won as everyone cheers and thinks the fight is over (except for Rick Jones). Iron Man continues his transmission, telling the world that he has injected the Hulk with nanobots that were made to suppress his powers. As Hulk slowly tries to get up, Iron Man flies up and authorizes an air strike against the Hulk. Missles fly towards him and explode in a huge blast. Hulk yells out Caiera's name and recalls his time with her, her news that she was pregnant with his child, the explosion of the warp core that destroyed everyone. Fresh with the memory that they've killed her, his anger is renewed.</p><p>Hulk jumps up and smashes into Iron Man in the air. They land in Stark Tower and Hulk continues to smash him. The heroes look on as they see Stark Tower begin to crumble. Iron Man tries to fight back with his repulsor blasts as the building ends up a pile of rubble. The heroes rush over only to find an angry Hulk emerging from the destruction, standing over what's left of Iron Man.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The next sci-fi epic blasts off here! In the grim aftermath of the Annihilation War, a devastated universe struggles to rebuild. Gripped by fear and paranoia, civilizations have collapsed and entire worlds are now smoking ruins. What’s next for the battle-weary heroes known as Nova, Peter Quill and Quasar (Phyla)? What are Ronan’s plans for the once-mighty Kree Empire? Which</p><p>cosmic characters of the past are about to return? Who is the new hero approaching on the horizon? And what is the new threat that no one suspects? Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, the acclaimed writing duo that brought you Annihilation Nova, unite with rising star Mike Perkins (Captain America, Union Jack) and cover artist Aleksi Briclot (World of Warcraft) to light the fuse on the next saga that will blast the universe wide open!</p><p>A group of mercenaries stands outside the temple of the Priests of Pama, a pacifist organization on an outworld planet. Balking at the requests of the robed monks for them to leave, one of the monks reveals herself to be Phyla-Vell, the new Quasar. As she identifies the temple as being under her protection, the band of mercinaries attacks. Using the Quantum-bands she stole from Annihilus, Phyla rushes into battle. As she is fighting she hears a strange voice in her head as Moondragon jumps in to assist. The pair make waste of the would-be pillagers quickly, and Quasar thanks Moondragon for the assist.</p><p>Heading back into the temple she informs the monk, to his surprise, that the mercenaries are to be taken in and given shelter and provisions. Times are hard and violent for many planets in the wake of the Annihilation wave and she would rather educate the misfortunate rather than condemn them for the crimes which they commit out of desperation.</p><p>Back in the temple Phyla confides in Moondragon that she is no where near experienced enough with the Quantum-Bands. The wielder must posses immense concentration and imagination. She also worries that despite all of her training she could never live up to the legacy of her father or brother, the first and second Captain Marvel. Phyla also mentions to Heather that she is concerned that they are wasting their potential assisting such small and depopulated outworld planets. Moondragon responds that their work is necessary for the rebuilding of the Kree empire as Hala and the Heartworld planets are being overseen by Ronan himself.</p><p>Meanwhile Peter Quill is on Hala working to repair the holes in Kree defenses made during the Annihilation. He describes his plans to Nova during a holo-communication on his way to greet a group of Galadorian space knights who's software may be able to upgrade the entire Kree defensive network, the only major defensive network left in the quadrant after the Annihilation. The Galadorians upload their software updates and a fleet of Kree Sentrys launch for a test demonstration watched by Ronin himself.</p><p>While Phyla is meditating she is interrupted by a strange voice in her head once more informing her that there is a great danger to her and that she is the only one that can find the one to prevent a great threat to the Kree. As she is describing what happened to Moondragon a rogue Kree Sentry destroys the wall of the temple. Phyla is able to take out the Sentry with a shockwave from the Quantum-bands targeted at the rogue machine.</p><p>Above Hala the Kree Sentrys begin scrambling over an intruder that doesn't exist and even take out a Kree ship in orbit around the planet. There is an incompatibility between the network and the programming that was just uploaded. The Galadorians inform him that there was not programming incompatibility before turning on him and commencing fire upon the Kree guards. Looking into the head Galadorian's eyes he sees a strange machinery. He then looks up to see all of the Kree sentrys flying overhead with the same mechanical infection.</p><p>After ravaging the city with destruction the Sentrys begin massing together over the city's main power generator and even begin fusing together into a tower-something that the Kree technology in the sentrys shouldn't even be able to do. The tower sends out a massive surge of energy that tears straight through a Kree destroyer and catches the attention of Phyla and Moondragon. Following the ripples caused by the energy surge Phyla finds a wall of energy that is surrounding all of Kree space. The Quantum-bands tell her that whatever is causing this energy dome has put the entire area of space out of phase with the rest of the universe so that nothing can get in or out--something that not even Galactus has the power to do.</p><p>On Hala the same t-o infection that took over the Galadorians begins to spread to all of the Kree on the planet as well. Peter Quill is pleased to see that the Kree under his command are coming back to help him, however they are revealed to have caught to the same mystery infection as everything else. As creatures begin to come free of the Kree sentry tower a voice booms to the people of Hala that they will not be harmed so long as they submit and that rather than conquest they seek to preserve the future of the Kree. The figure identifies itself as the return of the Phalanx and that it has finally completed its conquest.</p><p><strong><em>The Phalanx Has Returned!</em></strong></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Find out how Spider-Man's super hero career began in a fully-painted recounting of the origin of the original hard-luck hero.</em></p><p>In MYTHOS: SPIDER-MAN, the classic origin is revisited once again. Written by Paul Jenkins with pencils by Paolo Rivera, this new take on the story gives a reimagining of how Spider-Man came into being. Using elements from all over Spidey's long history, the story is a fresh look at how Peter Parker became the Amazing Spider-Man.</p><p>In MYTHOS, we'll see some of the characters that are just as important as the wall crawler himself. Friends like Mary Jane and Harry Osborn fill the halls at Midtown High and Aunt May and Uncle Ben offer their love and sage advice. Just as in the original telling, Uncle Ben regales to Peter the one principle that Peter would base his entire crime fighting life on--with great power comes great responsibility. In all versions of Spider-Man's genesis, this one piece of fatherly influence has been what makes Peter Parker a better man and a better hero.</p><p>With some familiar elements and some you may not expect, MYTHOS will remind you of just who Peter Parker is, and why after 45 years we are still captivated by a web slinging hero who has just as many problems as we do.</p><p>Relive the birth of a hero in MYTHOS: SPIDER-MAN by Paul Jenkins and Paolo Rivera</p><p>School is rough for Peter Parker. The students ignore him while he is there. He leaves and no one even notices. Back at home Aunt May prepares a plate of wheat pancakes for her nephew. As Peter just stares at his food Uncle Ben asks him what is wrong. Peter comments on the food and Uncle Ben says he wasn't talking about the food. Peter comments about how rough school is for him, and the bully named Flash Thompson. Uncle Ben tries to comfort Peter by telling him that Flash is really scared of Peter's intellect and high grades, then says a variation on Spider-Man's famous advice: \"If you have power, then you have responsibility.\"</p><p>Later Peter and his class attend a scientific demonstration on ionized radiation. While Peter is asking questions on the effects of the ionized radiation a spider wanders though the radioactive beam becoming infused with radiation, lands on Peter's hand, and gives him a bite. Peter staggers out of the building and notices that the bite wound on his hand is glowing. He wanders across a street right in the path of a speeding car. The car blares its horn and before Peter knows what is going on he finds himself on a fire escape two stories up.</p><p>The next morning Aunt May and Uncle Ben are looking for Peter to help him get ready for school but he is nowhere to be found. Peter is blocks away in a bike helmet and pads spinning webs and swinging from building to building. He discovers that he has the proportional strength and speed of a spider, clear vision, and the ability to walk on walls along with his ability to spin webs from his hands. He then dwells on a way to use his new abilities to make money.</p><p>Creating a Spider-Man costume for himself he locates a manager and gets bookings on a variety of Television shows. While collecting his cut from the taping of a late-nite tv show he sees a man running through the parking structure carrying a purse and a pearl necklace. The man runs past Peter and he doesn't even try to stop him. The security guard asks why he didn't even try and Peter responds that they haven't been there for him all those years, so why should he be there for them.</p><p>Costumed, Peter swings home where his Aunt May and Uncle Ben have been wondering where he has been getting all of his money. At home he is greeted by police officers at his front door. The cop tells him that with all of the money lying around the house there was a break-in and his Uncle was shot and killed. Hurt and angry peter suits back up and swings across the city to an abandoned warehouse where the criminal is holding up. He wrestles the criminal to the floor and recognizes his face from the parking structure earlier. Enraged Peter drags the criminal up the side of the building telling him that he should have killed him when he had the chance. Peter holds the thug over the side of the building threatening to kill him while asking him to tell him that he has all the power. When the thug agrees and says it peter tells him that he should kill him right then, but he has a responsibility even to him. Peter leaves the criminal wrapped in webbing from a light-post for the cops to find. Later comes his Uncle's funeral and a period of mourning. Spider-Man is born.</p>",

As the \"piece de resistance\", and for the first time in many years, Ben Edlund will contribute 3 ORIGINAL PAGES featuring his famous creation! </p><p>As for the stories, the creators were each asked to to write and draw a one page (in some special cases, 2 pages) Tick short tale as if they had total control over the character... and yes indeed they do! The styles of these varied and talented artists range from the super-heroic all the way through the \"alternative\" world of comics. In addition to these stories we've included many Tick-related articles such as\"Arachnida by Ben Edlund\", \"The History of the Tick as I Know It\", \"The High Cog Speaks\" and the \"2006 San Diego Comic-Con Report\". If all that isn't enough, we've added the complete creator index/bio pages that includes photos (or illustrations) of each of the contributors in this issue! </p><p>Contributors to The Tick 20th Anniversary Special Edition include (UPDATED 5/25/07): </p><ul><li>Ben Edlund</li><li>Richard Edlund (Ben's Dad!)</li><li>Erik Valdez y Alanis</li><li>Kevin Atkinson</li><li>Bryan Baugh</li><li>Simon Bisley (cover)</li><li>Jason Burns</li><li>Zander Cannon</li><li>Jerry Carr</li><li>Benito Cereno</li><li>Gabe Crate</li><li>Jef Czekaj</li><li>Dave Garcia</li><li>Fred Hembeck</li><li>David Hopkins</li><li>Paul Hornschemier</li><li>Josh Howard</li><li>Jason Jensen</li><li>Matt Kindt</li><li>Terry Moore</li><li>Chris Reilly</li><li>Brock Rizy</li><li>Trina Robbins</li><li>Scott Shaw</li><li>Arthur Suydam (cover AND an interior page!)</li><li>Anne Timmons</li><li>Robert Tinnell</li><li>Cory Walker</li><li>Sean Wang</li><li>Mark Wheatley</li><li>Bill Tucci</li><li>Mark McKenna</li><li>Alan Hopkins (Original Man Eating Cow Artist)</li><li>Bill Sienkiewicz</li></ul><p><strong>Twenty!</strong><br/></p><p>The Tick mistakes the Anniversary section of the news paper for the obituary section, and cries out about the loss of himself.</p><p><strong>A Brief Overview of Our Champion</strong><br/></p><p>We become asweat with knowledge about the many aspects of our hero:</p><p>Mental Fortitude<br/></p><p>Strengths, Weaknesses, and/or Carports<br/></p><p>And Finally Friends and Enemies</p><p><strong>Moth Magnet!</strong><br/></p><p>On his way to the 7-11 to acquire a cherry pez (the emperor of all fruity flavors) the Tick discovers a sealed laboratory canister filled with a radioactive isotope.

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The Summer Event of 2007 begins here! Top Cow Productions is proud to present a sneak preview of First Born, the highly anticipated three issue limited series debuting in July. Buzz has been steadily building for Top Cow's first comic event in years since it was first announced in Wizard Magazine's 2007 Preview Issue in January.</p><p>This First Look introduces new fans to the story leading into First Born as well as an exclusive early look at the event itself. </p><p><em>Witchblade Recap</em></p><p>Sara Pezzini was the daughter of a New York City police officer. She followed in her father's footsteps and during an undercover investigation one night, stumbled upon the Witchblade and became its latest bearer. The artifact with enormous destructive potential and Sara has had to wrestle against it time and again. The Witchblade is the male offspring of two forces of the universe, The Angelus and The Darkness. After learning about the Witchblade, Sara remained a cop and started taking on the cases that were too weird or were deemed unsolvable. That all ended when she became pregnant. The pregnancy was unexpected and impossible because Sara hadn't had sex in more than a year. Nevertheless she decided to keep the child. To assure its safety she passed on the Witchblade to Danielle Baptiste and took time off work. Some of her allies include Detective Patrick Gleason (her lover), Patience (the current Magdalena), and Jackie Estacado (current wielder of The Darkness). Their common enemy is the Angelus. Though currently without a host, the agents of the Angelus are still completing their masters work. </p><p><em>The Darkness (partial story)</em></p><p>The Butcher is torturing a member of an Armenian gang that has been moving into Franchetti territory. Butch tries to get something out of him but even removing teeth fails to provide any information. Jackie comes from the shadows and starts his own interrogation. He first talks kindly with the man, but when he receives nothing but insults in return, it's time to stop being gentle. Jackie turns out the lights and starts to terrify the man with his creatures. The man screams in fear and seems ready to talk, but before he can, the roof of the building is torn open and Angelus pour in. </p><p><em>Sketchbook</em></p><p>The last couple pages are filled with sketches and art made by Stjepan Sejic.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Superstar writer Paul Dini (52, Lost) makes an explosive return to Top Cow in 2007 when he brings brand new character Madame Mirage to the Top Cow!</p><p>But who is this beautiful woman who appears out of the mist? As deadly as she is beautiful, she is cutting a bloody path through the city's villains, who now wear suits and have \"legitimate\" businesses. But who is her ultimate prey? And how does this Mirage take form? And why is her destiny and that of her sidekick Harper so irrevocably entwined? These and many other questions will be asked along with the most pivotal question of all – Who is Madame Mirage?</p><p>Dini weaves a tale of murder, intrigue and revenge in a world of high-tech espionage and treachery. Joining Dini is rising artistic star, Kenneth Rocafort (Hunter-Killer) with his atmospheric and kinetic style. The first issue features two covers by sensual cover artist Greg Horn (Superman Returns, She-Hulk) as well as a stunning cover by series artist Rocafort. Madame Mirage – you'll never forget her… if you can make her acquaintance and live to tell the tale. Oversized first issue featuring bonus additional pages of story and art!</p><p>Around the turn of the twenty-first century mankind got one of its greatest wishes--bio-engineering and cybernetic technology advances have allowed mankind to create individuals who have strength and power that normal people could only dream about.  These powers allow a dedicated few to work for the betterment of mankind and the salvation of its people.  These wonderful turns of events come with a price.  Why work hard to better the living condition of so many when it is so much easier to use such gifts to victimize the general population?  With a rise of heroes came a surge of similarly augmented people intending to break, loot, seal, and kill anyone that stands in their way.  A world protected by their advanced saviors was now ripe for the taking by those who wished it harm.</p><p>With super-powered villains numbering far greater than those willing to serve and protect a global treaty was enacted banning such living weapons.  Those twisted scientists and high-powered criminals that could escape persecution hid out from capture and went underground.  In an ironic twist those who chose to use their powers to help their fellow man turned themselves in peacefully--and paid the price for their admirable goals when they faced hard time in prison.  Most of them would quietly serve their time and then slip out into anonymity.</p><p>Many of the super-criminals that haunted the world would band together, pooling their resources.  These vast resources allowed the conglomerates that they formed to bribe as they pleased, securing high power in industry.  Their enhanced skills were still used under the table, contracted to the highest bidder.</p><p>This brings us to the present--Los Angeles.  Former super-criminal come hit-man for hire Vinnie (the Hummingbird) removes his cloak revealing a high tech apparatus strapped to his back and jet-engines boost him high above the city streets.  His flight and first mission within the organization that employes him will come to an abrupt and premature end as a tall, dark woman clad in a white dress, black stockings, and black hat would take aim and fire two shots directly into his jet pack.</p><p>Vinnie's death of the explosion would make headlines in the next morning's newspaper.  Senior members of Aggressive Solutions International would now debate what, if any ties remained to Vinnie.  One in particular, Roger Maitland, would use this event to plot his early retirement.  With a briefcase full of ten million dollars and millions stolen from the corporation over the years in offshore accounts Roger decides to make his move.  As he is leaving the office for a dinner meeting a paranoid Roger sees everything that is said to him on the way out as out of the ordinary--from his secretary to the man next to him in the elevator.</p><p>At the grill Roger meets his girlfriend April who he tells about the week long business trip that he is planning in Europe and the two go separate ways.  A large man grabs April and feigns knowing her and brings her in close.  As the human mountain is about to make his move a woman jumps out of the stall next to them and firs three shots at point-blank range into his back.  With the towering man stunned and on the ground she grabs April and the two sneak into a secret room behind a broken mirror to see the same woman that had secretly killed the Hummingbird the night before.  They explain that the large, blond man was under Roger's employ and was paid ten thousand to kill her.  To prevent her from getting into more trouble her saviors knock her unconscious, and put her in a taxi destined for her home.</p><p>Roger gets back into his limo to realize that his driver has been replaced with the shadowy woman and he has no way out.  Speeding through the LA streets she explains her detailed knowledge of everything that A.S.I. is responsible, that she is responsible for the death of their newest recruit, and that earlier that afternoon she played the role of both his secretary and the man in the elevator at A.S.I. headquarters.  A frightened Roger attempts to bribe her with a the suitcase of money, which she tells him is sadly a buck and a half short of her asking price.  As Roger pleads for his life she disappears into a wisp of smoke and the limousine flies head-on into the jet that was supposed to carry Roger to his peaceful future in Europe.  The authorities that were chasing the speeding limo get out of their cares to see the shadowy woman blow them a kiss and then disappear into the flames of the wreckage.  What is left of her is a pair of stylized, burning, nested M's on the ground.</p><p>The next day the Dude, the hitman Roger Maitland hired to kill his girlfriend was released early by the hospital due to a lack of any real tissue damage by the bullets.  Back at A.S.I. headquarters he explains what happened to his superiors who know that Roger was siphoning money from them all along.  When he removes his jacket they notice a disk that a nurse at the hospital had slipped onto him.  They play the disk and the shadowy woman introduces herself as Madame Mirage, and explains what she has done so far and that no one within the corporation is safe from her before disappearing into a cloud of smoke again.  The man she addressed on tape is now forced to go tell the other board members that they all now have a problem.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>When the Illuminati voted to shoot the Hulk into space, Professor X wasn't there...but the Hulk just found out he was supposed to be. So he shows up at the Xavier Institute to ask a few pointed questions, Hulk style. With the other teams away, only Beast and the New X-Men stand between the massive rage of the Hulk and the Professor...not to mention the younger students who'd be caught in the crossfire. Can the X-Men-in-training survive the wrath of the Jade Giant until the other X-teams get back? Or will the young mutants become casualties of the World War Hulk?</i></p> <p>A little while ago, Tony Stark and Professor Xavier met to update each other. Charles informs him that Havok and Polaris and with the Starjammers and will send along information about the Shi'Ar Empire. Stark asks him if he could ask Havok to keep an eye out for the Hulk while he's out in space. Charles doesn't know why he'd run into the Hulk. Stark tells they voted to send Hulk off planet after he went on a rampage in Las Vegas. They know that he didn't end up on the uninhabited planet they intended him to land on. Since Namor voted against the idea, Tony asks Charles how he would've voted had he been there.</p> <p>Today, at the Xavier Institute, Charles is in the subbasement using Cerebra to see if he can locate any new mutants. Since M Day, there hasn't been a single new mutant. Up above, Beast is having a training session with the students in the living room. He tells them that if and when they get in a battle, there will be civilians they need to be aware of. They need to be able to fight in different environments. Suddenly they feel a tremble and notice that the O.N.E. sentinels are taking off. Since they're job is to watch over the mutants at Xavier's, they wonder what emergency could have called them away. Hank turns on the television to see if there is a news reportwhen she sees the Hulk's message for all of New York City to evacuate within twenty-four hours. Hellion feels they should rush over there to take on the Hulk while Mercury says too many civilians could get hurt and they should help evacuate them.</p> <p>There is another tremble and Hank rushes to the window. He is shocked to see that Hulk has arrived on their doorstep demanding to see Xavier. Prodigy and Elixir rush in to see if Hank knows that Hulk is there. Hank tells them to get the other students out through the Morlock tunnels and to tell the Professor what is going on. Rockslide is excited to be able to fight the Hulk. Beast tells him it's not something to wish for but they need to buy time for the other mutant students to escape.</p> <p>Beast answers the door as Hulk has been gracious enough to wait outside for Xavier. Beast tells Hulk that Xavier can't come and when Hulk says he'll find him himself, Hank once again says he can't allow that either. Hulk knocks Hank away and tells him that he wasn't asking for permission. The other students take this as their cue to attack.</p> <p>They manage to knock Hulk outside. Hulk tells Beast he has two seconds to get the kids off of him or whatever happens to them in on Hank's shoulders. Beast takes Elixir over to Hulk telling him to use his death touch on him. Elixir is hesitant because he doesn't want to kill him. Hank tells him he'd probably get a medal if he did. Hank asks Hulk if he understands what the touch did to him. He says it just made him madder. He grabs a statue and smashes it at them. He claps his hands to make a sonic boom to try to rupture Hellion's eardrums so he can't use his telekinesis. Dust tries to attack him but Hulk just grabs a water pipe from the ground and squirts her away. Hank tries attacking again only to get another punch. Now it's Rockslide's turn. Hulk seems to know that he is the one that can control his body when it's in pieces. First he rips off both his arms. Then forcing him down with his foot, he rips off both his legs. He tosses them back and asks if he can still control them if they land in Connecticut. </p> <p>Hulk asks whose turn is it to get hurt next. X-23 just sees him as a target and rushes at him. Hulk asks if she's Wolverine's sidekick and grabs both her arms in one hand. X-23 uses a claw in her foot and slashes Hulk in the eyes. Surge blasts him and Beast and X-23 both start hitting and slashing him. Hulk knocks them all away saying that his eyes just grew back so that means his healing factor is back to normal (after Elixir's touch). He throws X-23 through the school's wall saying he hopes she heals like Wolverine does. He tells them that he didn't want it to be like this. He just wanted Xavier.</p> <p>As Hulk looms over Hank and Elixir, he feels pain at his back. Wolverine, Cyclops, Colossus, Kitty Pryde (and Lockheed), and Emma Frost have arrived. Despite having blood pouring from his back, he seems to be happy saying that this is the fight he was expecting. Xavier appears in the doorway telling Hulk that they will not fight. Now that the students are safely away, he has come to him. Hulk notices that Xavier is walking again and says that he can \"fix\" that. Charles uses his powers to mentally stop Hulk. He is surprised at how fierce Hulk's mind has become. He experiences feedback and sees Hulk's experiences on Sakaar. He sees how he was a slave and gladiator. He sees that Hulk found happiness with a wife and child on the way. He sees the destruction and death of so many, including his wife and unborn child. </p> <p>Beast was able to \"see\" all this too. Charles tries talking to Hulk. He says that the others did send him into space but they wouldn't have sent the bomb with him to destroy everything. He says that he knows that. He was able to beat some information out of Black Bolt and knows that Xavier was supposed to be there with them when they made their decision. He wants to know how he would have voted on the destruction of his life.</p>",

Maybe the Decepticons and Dr. Doom know! War is about to break out on the border between Latveria and Symkaria -- unless two unique teams of heroes can unravel a dark mystery… that is, if they don’t destroy each other first! Stuart Moore (WOLVERINE, PUNISHER X-MAS SPECIAL) and Tyler Kirkham (X-MEN: PHOENIX WARSONG) bring together fan-faves like Wolverine, Megatron, Spider-Man and Optimus Prime in this all-new, four-issue, widescreen adventure!</p><p>Avengers Captain America, Luke Cage, Wolverine and Spider-Man are in Latveria investigating a radiation signature that SHIELD thinks is coming from something Dr. Doom is doing. Clearing a hill the team comes across a strange dome covered in energy and broken Doombots scattered around its base. Maria Hill tells them over a communicator that the dome doesn't match Doom's technology, but that since it's probably connected to the rising hostilities in nearby, they should check it out anyway. Wolverine and Luke get closer and break a hole in the dome and Captain America gets mad at them for not waiting his orders. Everyone gets a little mad, but they proceed into the base. They enter a corridor and are welcomed by strange reflective walls and a barrage of lasers. As a laser hits each hero, a voice somewhere else monitors data collected by the attack. When Spider-Man gets tagged the voice says that he's \"perfect\" right before Spider-Man gets electrocuted and then taken away by a car. Wolverine gets mad and tries to cut his way out but finds himself facing a force field. Captain America, Wolverine and Luke all start yelling at each other and mysterious machines monitor them from elsewhere.</p><p>The machines, called Autobots, realize what is going on. Their enemy Megatron is broadcasting an \"aggression wave\" that makes causes all nearby humans to act violently. The countries that Maria had mentioned earlier were going to war because of this aggression wave and now the Avengers were going for each other's throats. The purpose of the wave was to make humans kill themselves leaving the planet open to Megatron. With this information, Optimus Prime decides to do something.</p><p>In the dome, Megatron has Spider-Man on what looks like an operating table. He says that Spider-Man will help him in his greatest triumph, but he doesn't tell him how.</p><p>At the force field, Captain America greets Ms. Marvel and Falcon as they land to provide backup. The team starts to fight once again, but before things go too far, the Autobots arrive. Optimus tells the Avengers to leave, but in response, Captain America leads his team in an attack.</p>",

The League of Assassins tracks Black Canary to Star City in an effort to liberate the child, Sin, they believe to be the DCU's next greatest assassin. Luckily, Black Canary has other plans for Sin's abilities and future.<br/></p><p>While at a fast food joint with Sin, Black Canary recounts her first meeting with the Green Arrow. She had just joined the newly formed Justice League and she and Green Arrow had been tasked with protecting the Japanese Prime Minister. He was being attacked by assassins dressed like Elvis and the whole time they were fighting, Green Arrow was trying (and mostly failing) to flirt with her. Black Canary had cleaned up most of the assassins but Green Arrow shot down an arrow flying at the Prime Minister's head and got all the credit. The archer, Merlyn, got away, but the Prime Minister was safe. After the fight, Batman revealed that he had been watching the whole time. That was ten years ago.</p><p>After Dinah tells her story, Sin asks her if she will marry him. Dinah says that it's complicated. Now that Sin is in her life, she has to watch out for her too, and she'll never have a normal life. When they're done talking and eating, Dinah goes to the bathroom and Sin goes to fool around in the play place. The young girl starts playing with other kids but is accosted by some boys. They try to get her to fight, and when she does, she takes down the whole play area. Dinah runs over and they both quickly run from the building, but as they're leaving, a man in a car is watching them. </p><p>At the hotel they're staying at, Sin goes to get some ice and the man starts talking to her while she's alone. Before he can say very much, Black Canary arrives and kicks him across the parking lot. She then goes over to the man and discovers that she knows who it is. </p><p>Inside the hotel room, Dinah explains to Sin that the man is her ex-husband, Craig Windrow. She asks him why he's there and Craig tells her that he's in money trouble and he needs her to beat up the guys that are after him. Later that night in his own room, Craig is getting attacked just like he knew he would. Black Canary comes by in time to stop the attackers and Craig says that he knew she would. He then tells her that he can get Sin enrolled in a school in Star City and that he'll do it as a way of thanking her.</p><p>The next day, Craig is in the office of a man who collects Green Arrow memorabilia. Their conversation reveals that him getting attacked was just a way to get Black Canary in the proper position for something else. What the something else is, is not mentioned, but the man is revealed to be none other than Green Arrows enemy, Merlyn.</p>",

Martha has seen much in her hundred years, from the triumphs and tragedies of the battlefront, to the deepest reaches of space. Today, she will finally see the truth.

Oliver is, on the advice of Hackett, investing $14,000,000 in \"a luxury resort in Fiji\" being built by Chien Na-Wei. At a charity event Oliver buys a Howard Hill bow. Oliver, after making a fool of himself, decides to join Hackett on the yacht to the luxury resort. While on the yacht Hackett reveals that there is no resort, and, after beating Oliver up, throws him overboard after he thinks he has killed Oliver.</p>",

And if you survive all that for a whole year, you'll face mandatory retirement. And there's no guarantee you'll live to see that retirement.

He does this simply because he is sick of being Superior Boy and longs to be a real hero. Unfortunately for him, he is an idiot. Not only does his costume (and name) make him the laughing stock of the whole convention, but he stupidly \"padded his resume\" and stated that he had every superpower. This means loads of trouble for our hero. Okay, sidekick.</p><p>What does all this mean?

The Fastest Man Alive.  He is back but was too late to save Bart.  Now he is out to catch Bart's killer.</p><p><em>Flashback to one hour ago</em></p><p>Wally, Linda, and the twins are sucked back to the present day.  Wally finds themselves in front of the Justice League and the Justice Society.  When Wally introduces the twins, Iris and Jai, Superman comments that the last time he saw them (not that long ago) they were still newborns.  Wally cuts him off and says they'll talk about that later.  Wally then senses something wrong in the Speed Force when Batman calls.  He gives them word of what is going down in Los Angeles with the Rogues.</p><p><em>Flashback to 59 minutes ago</em></p><p>In Los Angeles, Bart Allen is dead.  Iris Allen West sits over his body as the Rogues look on.  They seem to be at a loss.  They didn't intend to murder him but things got out of hand.  They quickly realize that all the heroes will be after them and try to place all the blame on Inertia.  As the Rogues try to capture Inertia for betraying his promise of unlimited power to them, he simply runs off.</p><p>Running for his life now, he sees a red and yellow blur coming up from behind.  Inertia's first reaction is that Bart is somehow back.  Seeing the look on his face, he is shocked when he figures it must be Wally even though he thought he was dead.  Wally continues to hold him by the collar, smashing and running along.  Wally begins using the speed force like he never has before.  He begins draining the speed force off of Inertia.  Inertia tries saying that it was Wally that took Bart's powers away, leaving him powerless against the Rogues.  As he tells Wally, a smile comes across his face.  He tells him that when he died, he \"screamed like a little bitch.\"</p><p>Wally is outraged.  He has never wanted to kill a man before and thinks that Inertia is not actually a man.  He's a kid and a clone of Bart.  But he does have a part of Bart in him somewhere.  Wally decides he can't kill him but will do something worse.</p><p><em>One week later</em></p><p>Wally is with his Aunt Iris.  He asks how she and Bart's girlfriend are doing.  Iris says Val is young and will be able to move on.  She was told that if she ever needed or wanted to talk, she's considered family.  She finally asks what happened to Inertia.  Wally tells her that he immobilized him permanently.  He is like a statue but alive, forever staring at a monument of Bart, seeing the man that he could never be. He says that the rest of the Rogues haven't been found yet but he has friends looking for them.  Across the world, they are getting picked up.</p><p>Wally begins to apologize for Bart's death.  Iris stops him and asks if he had a choice in coming back.  Wally says no so Iris tells him to act like Bart and not dwell on things beyond his control.  She tells  him to be a good family man as they look out at the twins with Linda in the backyard.  He asks her if she remembers anything about the future of the West family.  She gets a look in her eyes and says, \"Not really...\"  What we get is a glimpse of the super-powered family.</p>",

He hasn't slept in a year and his angst has reached a peak. He has become the \"character\" Doktor Sleepless and he wishes to bring salvation to those he feel jipped of a future.</p><p>At a local dance club, DJ Amun is confronted by a former lover who has kept his aborted child/fetus with her in a vial around her neck. He freaks out, Sleepless takes his Pronoia, and he ends up killing himself. His friend, Sing, finds out the next morning that Amun is dead, thanks to her contact lens with advanced technology. Sleepless now begins to size up Heavenside with his nurse for his upcoming unveiling.</p><p>At Sing's bookstore, a shipment shows up unsolicited from John Reinhardt and Sing wonders it Johnny is back in town when she sees his address. Accompanying the address, though, is the name Doktor Sleepless and not Johnny's. Sleepless pays visit to a local grinder bar where he revives a man everyone thinks is gone for good. Doing so, he proclaims himself the \"Future Science Jesus\".</p><p>Back at Sing's bookstore, she and her friends enjoy a drink in DJ Amun's honor, putting on his radio show hoping a pre-taped show would be playing. Instead, Sleepless has taken over the airwaves, proclaiming what is on everyone's minds: \"Where is our future? The one we deserve?\" He turns on a signal in the air which shows the number 666 in gears before putting the music back on the air.</p>",

Bringing together The Darkness and Witchblade along with no less than three Marvel superstars, this crossover is going to bring the house down!<br /><br /></i><p><i>Every mob boss needs a competent lawyer. Jackie Estacado's hired a great one (even though he does happen to be blind). But even if Jackie can beat the rap, the Spirit of Vengeance is not so easily satisfied. As if a battle royale between The Darkness and Ghost Rider weren't enough, this special features The Incredible Hulk rampaging through New York City, both the current and former bearers of the Witchblade, and even an appearance by the master of the mystic arts, Doctor Strange. A stand-alone story that nevertheless sets the stage for Top Cow's First Born event, this is a tale in which all hell breaks loose -- literally! </i></p><p><i>Written by Ron Marz (Witchblade, Ion) and drawn by Top Cow's latest find, Michael Broussard, this is one crossover that demands your attention. Oh, yeah... The book also contains an exclusive preview of First Born!</i></p>",

Now the sadistic sorcerer makes a play for power that will once again bring these two famous heroes together -- but will it be as friends or foes?</p><p>Writer Michael Avon Oeming (OMEGA FLIGHT, Red Sonja) and Mel Rubi (Red Sonja) – plus series cover artist Michael Turner (CIVIL WAR) – answer the eternal question: What's better in a fight, the proportional strength and speed of a spider, or cold, hard steel and a chain–mail bikini?</p><p>Everything seems ordinary in New York City as Spider-Man swings around town and fights a group of bad guys ... all while talking on his cell phone to MJ!</p><p>At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Senator Thomas is attending a major art exhibit while battling his conscience over some shady dealings with his confidant, Reilly. J Jonah Jameson welcomes the Senator to the exhibit with kind words, hoping to score an interview. Thomas agrees to it, but his eyes are drawn to a unique necklace on display. Though the curator, Professor Jones protests, Thomas puts on the necklace. This in turn releases the imprisoned spirit of the sorcerer Kulan Gath. Using his vast powers, he reshapes New York City into his own medieval/Hyborian version of itself. Spider-Man seems to be the only one unaffected by the spell.</p><p>People are still in need of help, though, so he springs to action to save the commoners. As he does so, Gath wishes Professor Jones to be his scribe. Refusing, Gath kills him and then requests Jameson to take over the duties. Gath then conjures up a sword and tells about how Spider-Man and Red Sonja foiled his plans before when they teamed up. This time he wishes to pit them against each other so they will be occupied. He calls forth Mary Jane to claim the sword and become Red Sonja. Spider-Man continues to fight his assailants, who have somehow become goblins in the meantime. Even though he saves the people, they fear Spider-Man as a demon. Getting away, he sees what used to be the Met and a strange glow. He goes to it to investigate and sees Mary Jane climbing the walls to get to the sword on the roof. Confronting her after she grabs it, he is instead face with Red Sonja.</p>",

But in Aberrance, U.S.A., freaks are big business. On the board of directors sit the freakiest freaks of all - birthed in the profane laboratories of Anton Arcane - THE UN-MEN. </i></p><p><i>In this new, ongoing series - masterfully mixing gritty noir, grindhouse horror and gallows humor - an albino agent known as Kilcrop is dispatched by the government to solve the murder of a sideshow attraction called 'The Gill-Boy.' To uncover the truth, Kilcrop must infiltrate Aberrance, where society's most misshapen outcasts find their own kind of freedom. But with the original Un-Men in charge, Kilcrop must confront a corruption far deeper than the mysterious death of a man who breathes through his neck. And he must deal with his growing love for a one-armed, angel-winged beauty named Niko - an attraction that could prove fatal. The truth he discovers may be the secret hidden within his own outsider's soul.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Exploding from the pages of 52 and exploring the timeline of the DC Universe comes a new monthly book featuring the greatest super-hero history will never know: Booster Gold! Following the universe altering conclusion of 52, Booster Gold wants what’s due to him — a spot on the Justice League of America! But the time stream’s in trouble, and Booster Gold is in the center of it! Now he must make a choice: reclaim his former glory or do the right thing, forgoing the credit. ALL-NEW Booster Gold will take you through time and space, to the greatest moments of the DCU that have happened and will happen. “52 Pick-Up” begins in this extra-sized issue #1! Someone is exploiting the ravaged time stream, hoping to eliminate the world’s greatest heroes — and only Booster Gold can stop them. But, really — Booster Gold? Why him? What does Rip Hunter truly want? And what shocking figure is behind it all? And coming up in the months ahead in DC’s time spanning monthly: the world’s greatest Green Lantern — Sinestro, Jonah Hex, Barbara “Batgirl” Gordon, Flash and Kid Flash, and plenty more of DC’s super stars from throughout its past and future!</i></p><p><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></p><p>=========================</p><p>Two months following the conclusion of <i>52</i>, it's Day 1 of Week 60. Booster and Skeets have been in hiding, waiting for the right time to show their faces once more. They re-debut themselves by taking on the Royal Flush Gang in Atlantic City. Apparently, before the battle started, Michael set off his JLA Emergency signal. After the Gang has been dispatched, the League. Disappointed that Booster would use his Emergency Signal when there is in fact no emergency, they inquire as to his motives. He asks to join the League once again, much to their disdain. It appears that rumors have surfaced saying that Booster faked his death for sympathy, after Steel saw him during WWIII 'running <i>the other way</i>'. Batman and Superman however have faith in Booster, and tell him that he has one week to prove himself.</p><p>It becomes apparent that Booster and Skeets have been taking refuge in the home of Daniel Carter, who refuses to take off the Supernova suit. It evidently \"freezes time\" for the wearer, effectively allowing them to go as long as they want without getting tired, hungry or thirsty. Booster had assumed the Daniel would do some good with the suit, but all he does is play video games all the time. Skeets' historical records are apparently still malfunctioning, making it difficult to use them to their advantage when trying to stop disasters. Michael refuses to use them anyhow, as he considers it \"cheating\".</p><p>Suddenly, in the middle of Daniel's living room, Rip Hunter arrives in his Time Sphere. Booster considers the man to have betrayed him after <i>52</i>, \"leaving Skeets and my reputation in pieces\". Rip scolds Booster for showing his face to the League, saying that he needed to stay in hiding to protect his knowledge of the Multiverse. Hunter takes Booster with him, leaving Daniel in a broken living room. As they traverse the time-stream, Rip reveals that one or more malevolent time-travelers are taking advantage of various \"worm-holes\" left in the aftermath of Mr. Mind's feast. Before he can finish what he's saying though, Rip drops Booster into one of the worm-holes. He finds himself in the midst of World War III once more, near a plummeting 747. He's told my Rip that he <i>must</i> save the plane. After dropping the aircraft off at a Tokyo airport, an investigative reporter by the name of Rose Levin thanks Booster for his bravery. He is quickly pulled back into the time-stream though, and Rip tells him that woman is another of his ancestors. She is to start Michael's direct lineage with Daniel Carter. Rip needs Booster's help to repair the damage to the time-stream, and stop whoever is destroying it. Booster refuses, not willing to sacrifice any more of his reputation just to stay incognito. Rip drops him off at home, disappointed.</p><p>One week later, Booster arrives at the Hall of Justice to hear the League's decision. With smiles across their faces, they hand Booster an invitation to the Justice League of America. However, before his eyes, the certificate transforms into the Death Certificate of Hal Jordan. Terrified, and convinced of Rip's warnings, Booster leaves the Hall, and tells the League that he simply wanted to be able to turn them down. He arrives at Rip's old bunker, and tells him that if he wants his help, they were going to save his best friend first, Ted Kord.</p><p>Elsewhen, somebody has stolen the Supernova suit, and encounters Sinestro on Korugar. \"They call me Supernova. We need to talk about your future.\"</p>",

The curse keeps him alive, but it’s what’s left of his twelfth-century sweetheart -- encased in enchanted metal and serving as his right arm -- that keeps him honest. Today, Terror runs a high-stakes private eye firm -- espionage, investigations and assassinations for the extremely rich and extremely powerful. But after eliminating who he was told was a very bad guy, with extreme prejudice and in his own inimitable idiom, Terror learns he’s been had -- he’s just murdered a major government intelligence chief. Now, with the feds on his rancid tail and whoever set him up looking to tie their loose ends, Terror’s on the run to clear his name and bring down the real bad guys. But the killers know exactly who they’re dealing with, and they aren’t making it easy for him…</em></p>",

The Queen is now declaring war on all heroes that pose a threat to New Port City by announcing preemptive strikes on cities that are home to said heroes. T-Division has recruited 2 members of Woods' team from the first attempt to take down Bomb by political means. their analysis of New Port City is that it corrupts the people who live there and is in fact pure Evil.</p><p>Meanwhile in New Port work has started on construction of Bomb Queen's new HQ the Tactical Information Turret (or T.I.T. for short). To get the work done in secret she hired teams, promises extra pay and perks and then sends them to Momma Wong's for free food where they are poisoned and disposed of. Momma Wong is very concerned that Bomb is taking the new powers she somehow absorbed from Bomb Teen for granted and reminds her that those powers were supplied by the Shadow Government.</p><p>Red Cross is keeping tabs on Bomb after their battle and is reporting back to T-Division on the queens plans. The escalation in threat means they decide to send in a strike team, breaking their bargain with Red Cross to allow her to finish of Bomb Queen once the innocent are rescued.</p><p>Meanwhile in Crawford Texas the military arrive at the presidents ranch and seal it of after a report of WMDs are present. They find a rocket in launch position in a barn.</p><p>At a rally in the main city square Bomb Queen addressed her public, humorously parodying famous speeches, to unanimous acclaim.</p><p>In a final panel a black clawed hand appears as a hidden character claims for a 1000 years of planning it has come to this, that all the puppets are now dancing to his tune, the forces of Earth, Heaven nor Hell will not be able to oppose him.</p>",

Super-star-to-be Mitch Breitweiser provides the finest art of his career as he chronicles the last days of Captain America...</p><p>Corporal James Newman, U.S. Marine, is stationed in Afghanistan.  He wants nothing but to help this country and his own.  He knows he is there to fight those that live for fear.  Those that believe Hate is the same as believing in God.  His wife has given birth to their son five months back and he can only hope that he survives to get home to see them.<br /></p><p>The attacks are brutal but he knows why he is there.  During one attack, he takes out a sniper and sees a couple cowering in the corner.  He begins to question how can he know if they are the people he's trying to protect or if they are really the enemy in disguise.<br /></p><p>Trying to figure out how to get his thoughts together, Captain America enters the room.  Handing him his helmut, Cap gives him the inspiration to get up and continue.<br /></p><p>Outside, one of Newman's squad members is pinned under some debris.  Cap uses his shield to block shots while Newman pulls the man free.  Another squad member is stuck in his tank with a broken leg. Captain America tells him that they are there to help him.  Newman manages to get him out and and carry him to safety.<br /></p><p>Newman calls out for Cap, asking if he can see anyone else that needs their help.  A voice tells him that he can hear him.  The man talking is his actual captain in his squad.  Newman asks where did Cap go?  He was right there.  His squad says it sounds like he's talking about Captain America and Newman says he is.  He tells them that Cap was next to him and helped save the men.  They all say that they only saw Newman.  The way he was fighting, he wouldn't have needed Captain America's help.<br /></p><p>Now Newman wonders if he's been fighting for too long.  He wonders if he's losing his mind.  Calling out for Cap, the scene shifts to a weakened Captain America lying in a hospital bed.  He speaks to Newman even though he can't hear him saying he's braver than he thinks.</p>",

            "description": "<p> <u><em>Overview:</em></u></p><p>It’s brother versus brother and the outcome could decide the fate of billions. UNCANNY X-MEN’S “Rise and Fall of the Shi’Ar Empire” continues here! Vulcan is the Shi’Ar Emperor and Havok is leading the rebellious Starjammers. But who is really right and who is really wrong? </p><p> <b> Issue Summary: </b></p><p> </p><p>The Eldest of a bug-like, alien race stares outside his window. Even after a millennium, he can still hear the screams. Outside, a gigantic battle is taking place, resulting in fiery explosions of death and destruction. Some other members of the race appear behind the Eldest, and warn him about a new development in the war:<em>they</em> have come… <em>the Shi’ar</em>. The Eldest realizes what that means: the time has come…</p><p><em>Shi’ar space, weeks later… <br />The supply line to the fourth Shi’ar fleet…</em></p><p>Inside one of the several Shi’ar ships lined up nearby three moons, a trooper wishes to speak to his captain. He reports their long-range sensors make no sense, as there an anomaly has been detected. There’s a strong electromagnetic field, but the trooper cannot detect its source. It is everywhere. “Gods preserve,” the captain panics. It’s a trap! The captain orders all of his Warbirds to go to condition black, because… the Starjammers are here!</p><p>Outside, the Starjammer ship approaches the Warbirds. Ch’od appears on the Warbird’s computer screen, and advises them to surrender. The captain of course refuses. To this, Ch’od replies that he shall put him in the “not wise” category then.</p><p>A moment later, the Starjammers, led by Havok, teleport within the ship and lay siege. The captain opens fire on them and orders his Warbirds to kill them all. Havok fires a blast in defense, but reminds his team that they need the captain alive. Lorna, as she magnetically tackles some soldiers down, jokes that she thinks Alex is talking to Rachel, because she stopped being crazy months ago. Rachel fires a telepathic blast on another soldiers, and mentions she’ll do her best, but will make no promises. Korvus Rook’Shir slashes his huge and powerful Blade of the Phoenix through his opponents, and mopes that the X-Men talk far too much in battle.</p><p>The captain warns his Warbirds not to let the Starjammers take over his ship. He is half-way through ordering the activation the self-destruct mechanism when Raza sneaks up on the captain and points his sword in the captain’s face, indicating he should stop where he stands. The captain obeys.</p><p>With the bridge now secured, Havok orders to open the comm channel. The captain shouts that taking his ship won’t accomplish anything. He points out there are eleven more Warbirds guarding the supply line, and one ship alone can’t stand against them. To this, a voice via comm. replies that he is correct… but the Starjammer is not alone. Seeing the source of the voice, the captain sees a screen on which Lilandra and her Major-General, Ka’ardum, appear. The captain is surprised to see them both still alive. Havok wants to talk to the captain about him and his regiment to join the resistance. Alex wants to discuss Emperor Vulcan.</p><p><em>Meanwhile on Chandilar, throneworld of the Shi’ar Empire…</em> <br />Weapon in hand, an armed soldier yells “death to the false emperor. Death to Vul…” At that moment, Vulcan fires his power blast at the soldier and kills him in mid-sentence. Vulcan tells his council that they’ll have to start over because he couldn’t hear anything over the screaming.</p><p>Vulcan goes to sit back on his throne, with his wife Deathbird standing beside him. Accompanying his court is a host of soldiers, positioned as an honor guard. Among their number is the superguardian, Gladiator. Returning to the subject at hand, Vulcan asks Araki to confirm what he just told him – that he isn’t loved by the Shi’ar people. Clearly nervous, Araki promises that he wouldn’t attempt to dishonor his lord, even if it meant his life. But it’s true, the Shi’ar Empire is tearing itself apart. The resistance to Vulcan’s rule is strong. His… elimination of former Emperor D’Ken has divided the people. And with Lilandra and Major-General Ka’ardum working with the resistance, more and more of the military are defecting.</p><p>To this, Gladiator dourly proclaims that these people lack honor. As Deathbird quietly smiles, Vulcan is more concerned that he isn’t loved by the people and demands to hear the truth. Araki is hesitant for a moment and then, with a bow, explains that only the presence of a member of the Neramani bloodline as royal consort is holding the remaining supporters in place.</p><p>Turning to his wife, Vulcan asks her what she thinks of that. Deathbird walks forward to Araki, and slashes his face with her sharp nails. As Araki reels in pain, Deathbird thinks aloud that Araki is a politician who likes to play games. She advisess him to remember that Vulcan is the Emperor now, whether the Secret Order likes it or not.</p><p>Changing subjects, Vulcan wants to hear about his brother now. He wants to hear about Havok and the Starjammers. He wants to know why they aren’t dead already.</p><p><em>The Clench Worlds, near Shi’ar space…</em> <br />Havok stands in the center of a briefing room, next to a holo projector on which a planet and its three moons are show. Addressing the assembly, he explains to his fellow Starjammers and newly gained allies in the warbirds. He shows them a hologram of three supply lines they have now captured. He thinks that, without resources and supplies, the empire’s war effort will be weakened and harder to sustain. The gasp is closing.</p><p>Alex next shows an image of a station called Feather’s Edge. He explains it’s defended by a series of Armageddon-class killstations. He admits their battle won’t be pretty, but cutting off Feather’s Edge will weaken Vulcan’s forces to a breaking point. Lilandra and Ka’ardum are also among the assembly. Alex tells Ka’ardum they’ve avoided amassing his armada until now, but Vulcan’s forces still outnumber theirs. However, Alex believes taking this target will even the odds. And afterward, they’ll bring the fight to Chandilar.</p><p>In a section off from the main area, Ch’od tells Lorna he’s confused. If Alex is filled with this “self-doubt” she spoke off, he thinks they should all start doubting themselves immediately. They’ll win this war much quicker, he jokes. Lorna responds that Ch’od should just wait for it. Lorna also notices Korvus is not present in the hearing. She noticed Korvus seemed cranky on the supply mission, and asks Rachel if the two of them are still fighting. Rachel answers that she broke off their relationship. They’re just too different. It’s too weird and too complicated. She thinks she should be okay, if she can keep from making out with him.</p><p>Back in the main chamber, Ka’ardum compliments Havok on the briefing and that, in such a short time, he has become an expert on the Shi’ar military landscape. He mentions that Alex’ strategies are excellent, and that he’s surprised Earth can spare such a natural leader. Alex points out that he’s just there to stop Vulcan. His brother Cyclops was a great leader, and so was his father. But not him, Alex sighs. Ch’od and the others heard Alex say this, Ch’od now seeing the doubt, much to his dismay.</p><p><em>Later, at the planet “Standing Still” <br />The resistance headquarters…</em> <br />Havok walks through the city streets, which are crowded by other aliens. He is approached by Korvus, who informs Alex that the people here are calling him “savior.” He gives them hope. Alex says they’re making a mistake. He’s just a man, and not much of one at that. Korvus grins that, luckily, their enemy is but a child. Alex agrees, but their opponent is the most powerful child in the galaxy.</p><p>As they stand before a grand view, a planet and two other moons rising above a desert landscape, Alex does his best to change subjects. When he asks Korvus if he and Rachel are still fighting, Korvus replies that Rachel vexes him. He finds it weird: war spreads across the galaxy, and he cannot stop thinking about her. He asks Alex for advice, seeing he is Rachel’s uncle. The only thing Alex can come up with, is saying that Rachel likes cheeseburgers.</p><p><em>At a bar…</em> <br />Nursing a drink at a bar, Rachel mopes that she could use a cheeseburger right now. And sweatpants. She misses her sweatpants. It feels like they’ve been out here forever. With her at the bar, whose patrons include numerous species of aliens, Lorna mentions that Alex told her he believes he can’t beat Vulcan. Alex knows he tried, but also that he failed. And that his father died for that. That’s what he thinks. Lorna jokes she thinks she’ll have to beat Alex up.</p><p>Changing subjects, she asks Rachel if she’s okay. Korvus distracted her, Rachel replies. He clouded everything. But she finally talked to Lilandra. Lorna is surprised to hear that, because they asked Rachel not to do so. Continuing, Rachel says she learned there is a Secret Order within the Shi’ar Empire. They’re the ones who ordered to murder her family. When Lorna begins to show sympathy, Rachel becomes angry, a blue Phoenix sign appears over her eye. She vows that after they’ve taken Vulcan down, she’ll find this Secret Order and will make them pay.</p><p><em>Chandilar, the Shi’ar throneworld…</em> <br />As he walks incognito among his citizens, a hooded Vulcan overhears two soldiers talking to each other. One of them heard that Vulcan was a slave, and that D’Ken took him in but that Vulcan in turned betrayed D’Ken and murdered him. The other soldier heard the same, but also that Vulcan is another mutant from Earth. Just like Lilandra’s<em>shame</em>… Xavier, whom they see as the Mummudrai destroyer. This soldier also believes someone should shoot Vulcan in the head before he destroys the Empire. Both soldiers want a true Shi’ar on the throne.</p><p>Though Vulcan grows angry, he doesn’t interfere. Instead, he is distracted by an image of himself on a large screen, and Shi’ar letters are marked over it. A female voice explains to Vulcan that the words mean: “<em>kill the false Emperor</em>.”</p><p>Turning to the voice, Vuclan is surprised to find Cal’syee, who’s also hooded. Deathbird jokes that the Emperor should not travel without an Imperial Guard escort. Gabriel points out that the Guard are as likely to try and kill him as anyone else, to which Deathbird confirms that’s true. The Guard does hate him. Vulcan isn’t exactly glad to hear that, but Deathbird asks her husband to let her finish. She thinks people hate their Emperor because they do not know him. Because they do not know that Gabriel<em>is</em> a Shi’ar.</p><p>Vulcan can’t believe his ears. Deathbird gently touches Gabriel’s face, and confirms the truth in her words. She can see it inside him, and is certain that the time will come when Gabriel shows the Empire that he was born to rule them. He will show them greatness that D’Ken never possessed. He will show them strength that Lilandra never had. And she’s certain that people will love him for that. As she does. They kiss. Deathbird asks Gabriel to come with her, as his spies have brought much news. She wants them to plan the death of the resistance.</p><p><em>Later, at Feather’s Edge…</em> <br />Polaris magnetically charges the Starjammers ship so their enemies can’t detect them. Havok compliments her on that, but Lorna asks them to hurry though. When Alex asks him if they’re ready, Ch’od replies that Corsair used to sing a song to lead them into battle. Alex asks if that’s true. “No,” Ch’od answers. His visage growing serious, Alex announces he is ready to do this.</p><p>Both the Starjammer ship and the Warbird ships start firing at Feather’s Edge, which does its best to defend itself. Still, Shi’ar stations explode under the attack. When an alarm suddenly fills the bridge, Alex quickly asks Ch’od for a status report. Incoming, he reports. By the energy signature… the Shi’ar are there… and lots of them. When Havok then turns to her, Rachel telepathically scans and confirms… Vulcan is there.</p><p>Standing confidently in his royal flagship together with Gladiator, Vulcan grins that his empire’s spies <em>are</em> good. He orders to kill the X-Men, Lilandra and Ka’ardum. He’s sure the others will fall in line afterward.</p><p>As the Shi’ar armada opens fire, Havok orders evasive maneuvers. However, Ch’od had already anticipated the order and has done so. Nearby, Raza notes that Vulcan brought the entire Shi’ar fleet with him, so that must mean he knew they were coming.</p><p><em>Meanwhile, at the wing of K’ythri, Ka’ardum’s battlecruiser…</em> <br />Lilandra and Ka’ardum see how their enemies concentrate fire on the Starjammers. She fears they’ll be killed. Ka’ardum thinks his ship will surely be next. Vulcan’s forces still outnumber theirs, even if by a little, and Vulcan also still has the Imperial Guard behind him. He fears that, if they fight now, they’ll all be killed. Lilandra doesn’t respond.</p><p>In his ship, Vulcan asks Gladiator if they should kill all of their opponents. He remembers that Gladiator said before that the Shi’ar who deflected lack honor. He wants to know if Gladiator would kill them all. Hesitant, Gladiator says that he only serves. It’s not his place to decide. Gabriel asks Gladiator that when he took his eye, if that was service as well. Or simply a decision?</p><p>They are interrupted by a powerful explosion, which tears Vulcan’s ship in half! The cause is a host of newly arrived fleet of immense, bug-like ships that fill the sky and outnumbering both fleets.</p><p>As Ka’ardum reels at the sight of the Hammer having been destroyed, Lilandra asks her uncle what’s going on. Whose ships are those? Interrupting, one of the bridge crew announces that the newcomers are broadcasting something.</p><p>Meanwhile, in their own ship, the Starjammers don’t understand what’s going on either. Raza smiles that it really happened… the ship that just blew up was the Emperor’s. Nearby, Ch’od learns via the broadcast that their new allies are calling themselves the Scy’ar Tal. He finds that a bold choice. Likewise, Korvus recognizes the meaning of the name, as does Rachel. “Scy’ar Tal” means… “death to the Shi’ar.” The name of their race means “Death to the Shi’ar.”</p>",

But with the rift between her and Wonder Woman, she's going to need the help of the last man on Earth she ever wanted to see again! WONDER GIRL will take Cassie Sandsmark to all corners of the DCU, from the dangers within WONDER WOMAN to TEEN TITANS to COUNTDOWN, and will change Wonder Girl forever!</p><p>With the world not too fond of Wonder Girl's recent actions during the Amazons Attack war, Cassie is living a low-key life in Georgetown, Washington D.C. When going out, she takes a cue from Connor and wears glasses and puts her hair up. She is renting a room from an elderly lady. She tells her that they will be getting a new \"roommate\" as a visiting professor will be staying there.</p><p>Heading to a pay phone, Cassie has arranged to receive a call from her mother at a set time. It turns out her mother bought a cell phone which concerns Cassie. She is concerned with how she paid for the phone and what name she used. She has been staying in Greece and says having a cell phone would make it easier to contact her. Cassie says she should just call the Titans Tower but her mom says she's never there anymore. Cassie sees a news report on a television in a store window with Robin and darts off, cutting off her conversation with her mother.</p><p>A protest is happening over some hydra eggs left over from the Amazons. The police aren't sure what to do with them and there are people protesting over animal rights. Wonder Girl shows up and says they need to be destroyed. They are too dangerous to keep at a zoo or sanctuary. Robin says there's always Superman's Fortress. Robin tells here that he was actually in the area to talk to her. He wants to talk about the kiss they shared. He stumbles with his words and she takes it the wrong way. Then the hyrdas begin to hatch. Robin throws some batarangs at them wondering how they can stop them. Cassie simply replies by going up to each head and snapping it's neck.</p><p>Robin tells her that was impressive but scary. He wants to finish what he was trying to say. Cassie cuts him off saying she gets it. It was just a \"heat of the moment\" thing. Upset, she flies off before he can say another word. Left behind, Robin says now he understands why Batman avoids the relationships.</p><p>Elsewhere, some Army soldiers prepare to take on another Amazonian beast. Some battle beasts have been seen. Wonder Girl arrives and tells them they will not be able to handle them. When the commander tries telling her that she needs to leave and that it's her people's fault this is going on, she destroys their vehicles. She tells them they are not equipped to handle them. If they want to kill themselves trying, they are welcome to it.</p><p>Spying a battle beast sleeping, she figures taking out one shouldn't be a problem. Detecting her scent, it wakes up. As she takes it down, she is soon visited by three more. Not sure if she can take on all three, she is surprised to hear her \"brother\" Hercules is there to help her.</p>",

The house is bare except for a paint that his mother told him she picked up at a flea market or from a street vendor.  The painting is a young boy lost in a field with a gray and wild sky overhead.  Kyle always wondered about the boy and how he got lost and his mother uses to tell him stories about how the boy would get home. </em></p><p><em>Kyle then looks out the window and sees himself, as Parallax attacking Hal Jordan.

Can Tommy help them out? Will he? Unpleasant secrets from the past return...on the Darkside.</em></p><p>Clark Kent is interviewed by a young journalist curious to find out the connection between Superman and a contract killer named Tommy Monaghan, known as Hitman. Kent tells the reporter of what happened some years before when the JLA were based at the Watchtower on the moon. Green Lantern leaves the Watchtower to investigate a damaged space shuttle that NASA has lost contact with. Scanning the craft with his ring and sending the results back to the tower alerts Batman to a potential threat.Monaghan, meanwhile, is in Gotham following a tip-off that four killers are after him. As the killers argue about who is in charge, Monaghan throws a bomb into the room, killing all of them.At the Watchtower, Batman reveals what was identified by Lantern's ring once he returns. The Bloodline parasites appear to be on the space probe. Realising they need a survivor of the parasites' earlier attack, Batman heads down to Gotham where he finds Monaghan and brings him back to the moon. Green Lantern is embarrassed when Monaghan recognises him and tells the others of how they had teamed up, causing Batman to lecture Lantern on the morality of associating with a hired killer. His tirade is cut short when Superman walks in and recognises Monaghan, greeting him as a friend. Batman tells Superman of Monaghan's profession which he shamefacedly admits to. Monaghan's blood is tested and compared to the readings from the probe; the creatures on the probe appear more advanced and a greater threat. The League disagree on how to deal with the threat of the aliens but their hand is forced when the probe accelerates and heads for the moon; it crashlands and Superman flies out to find any survivors. At the Watchtower, the four remaining heroes and Monaghan suddenly feel their individual powers waning and it is Monaghan who reminds them that if it has happened to all of them, it may have happened to Superman who is outside on the moon's surface.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Finally! Part Five of <strong>Who Is Wonder Woman?</strong></p><p><em>Overview</em></p><p>At long last, the climactic, extra-length chapter of \"Who is Wonder Woman?\", the story that launched the WONDER WOMAN monthly! In this arc's conclusion, the combined forces of Wonder Woman's transformed rogues gallery declare an all-out war on the amazing Amazon, compelling Wonder Woman to mend fences and join forces with Donna Troy and Wonder Girl if she's going to survive to answer the question: \"Who is Wonder Woman?\"</p><p>And if the return of Allan Heinberg and Terry Dodson isn't enough, there's also an all-new backup by Heinberg and the upcoming art team of ACTION COMICS, Gary Frank and Jonathan Sibal, featuring the secret origins of Wonder Woman, Donna Troy, Wonder Girl, Sarge Steel and Nemesis! All questions will be answered, all secrets revealed!</p><p>Wonder Woman is confronted by her entire rogues gallery, where she finds herself at a disadvantage because their powers have been enhanced by Circe. All of them persuade Wonder Woman to join them as rulers of the new world. She asks how they would run the place any better than it is and they reply that the politicians and corporations are far more dangerous than them.</p><p>Wonder Woman fights back but her enemies overpower her because of their sheer numbers. Just as it seems as if Wonder Woman is about to lose, the rest of Earth's superheroes arrive on the scene and help her out. As they join her, she asks how they managed to find her. She is told that they found a herb which was connected to Circe, so they visited her home of Aeaea.</p><p>Nemesis tells Wonder Woman that she was missed and Donna tells her that she was never comfortable taking her place. Wonder Woman thanks them for helping but she says that this battle with Circe and Hercules is her own fight.</p><p>She flies to the temple and sees Hercules and Circe fighting. As Hercules grabs Circe by the throat, Wonder Woman hurls across the chamber. Hercules manages to trip her and hold her against the floor with a sword to her throat. He offers her a chance to build a new Olympus but Wonder Woman refuses. He says that he will take her by force, just like he did to Hippolyta and Wonder Woman manages to push her off.</p><p>She pins him down with his own sword and threatens him that she is willing to kill him. Circe steps him and says that this is her duty now and she blasts Hercules with her magic, wrapping him in chains. Wonder Woman turns to Circe and says that however righteous her intentions, the witch has caused just as much suffering. However, Circe justifies herself saying that her eternity is her punishment. Diana then realises that they have something in common – that they both want to be human. Circe reminds Diana that she had done that before by stripping Circe of her powers. Circe then asks if Wonder Woman would be human if she had a choice. She replies that she is grateful for such blessings, but she is hardly human being made from clay. She has no idea who she is or what she is. All she knows is that she is alone, but Circe replies, \"Which is how most humans feel all the time.\" The other super heroes approach Circe and adds that Diana has never been alone. Unbeknown to Wonder Woman, she performs one final act of magic on the Amazon Princess.</p><p>A few days later at the Department of Meta Human Affairs, Agent Prince and Nemesis are debriefing Sarge Steel on recent events. Afterwards, they collect the capture rogues' weapons. He hands her the Valkyrie's sword and cuts herself. She stares down in shock. Nemesis tells her that it is only a scratch, but to her, it is something much more.</p><p>Later, she meets up with Donna and shows her her cut hand. Donna asks what happened and Diana tells her that her powers are gone, unless she transforms into Wonder Woman. She does her twirl and instantly heals. Donna asks why Circe would do such a thing. Diana replies that if the witch wanted to kill her, she would've have done that a long time ago. Instead, she believes that Circe had given her a gift. Wonder Girl arrives and says that witches don't leave gifts, but curses, which means that Circe has made it impossible for Diana to Agent Prince. But Diana disagrees and actually thinks that Circe is allowing her to be Diana Prince for the first time. That way, when she transforms into it's not because she has to, but rather choose and want to.</p><p>The both of them fly off to arrange a press conference of Wonder Woman's return, and Diana meets up with Batman on a rooftop. She thanks him for helping her out. He replies, \"They love you Diana. They always have. Because that's what you inspire in anyone who's ever met you. That's what makes you more powerful than any of us.\"</p>",

One of Omega's teenage fans was award-winning novelist Jonathan Lethem, who has used the original as a springboard for a superbly strange, funny, and moving graphic novel in ten chapters.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The new Green Arrow/Black Canary team investigates the shocking results of the Wedding of the Century in an all-new adventure that brings the Star City-crossed lovers together!</i></p><p>The issue begins with a flashback, as an introduction to their beginning relationship. Green Arrow asks if she’s Black Canary, and Black Canary wonders if he’s Green Arrow. Some flirting happens between them, with Black Canary saying, “If your idea of a pickup line is complimenting my mother, your game needs work.” Green Arrow replies that that wasn’t a pickup line, and he really is a fan of Black Canary’s mother. He also adds that his game doesn’t need work. Black Canary thinks differently, as she says, “I think you just sat on some chewing gum.” She adds that she “only noticed because I was checking out your ass even more than you were checking out mine.”</p><p>It cuts back to present time, where some mercenaries are running from trouble, and Black Canary flies in, kicking a mercenary. She fights the mercenaries single handily. She beats them all, when one of the down mercenary gives her attitude. She turns around and beats him, to the point of near death. Green Arrow, who is currently taken by Connor Hawke, flies in, and tells her to stop. He also comments that he’s been seeing that a lot lately. Black Canary walks off and says, “Well I guess everyone’s lucky you’re here to referee.</p><p> </p><p>At Connor’s apartment, he has a conversation with Speedy and comments on Black Canary’s behaviour. He tells her of how she almost beat a man to death and says, “She’s… she’s not coping very well,” and Speedy replies, “Oh my God… You really think so, Dr. Phil?”</p><p> </p><p>Elsewhere with Black Canary, she stares at Oliver Queen’s dead body in a glass coffin and remembers the night in which he almost killed her with a knife. In self defence, she killed him with one of this own arrows and stabbed him in the neck. It cuts to a montage, where many members of the Justice League of America console her. Hal Jordon says that they should perhaps bury the body as it’s been a month already. Black Canary says that it’s not him, but Hal thinks she is in denial. She insists that it’s not him, but Hal thinks differently. She continues to explain that it isn’t him. The man that attempted to kill her wasn’t him, but Hal keeps telling her that she is in denial. He tells her in frustration how he would want him alive too and too. Hal points Black Canary to his ring, and says that the ring doesn’t lie. Batman cuts in, and says that it can be deceived. Black Canary asks if he believes her, and in agreement, he says that all this makes very little sense.</p><p> </p><p>He continues to explain how it’s strange, because if someone has gotten Green Arrow to murder her during the night, it’s a good plan but it’s been a month and no one come to finish the job. He also continues to explain that if someone wanted Green Arrow dead, that wouldn’t make sense too, because if someone did kill him, they would want to gloat about it and no one has done so. He also wasn’t in anything that would was on about that would make him a target either.</p><p> </p><p>At the Batcave, Dr. Mid-Nite and Batman are preparing to do an autopsy on Green Arrow and tells Black Canary that she should probably go site somewhere else, because it’s going to be ugly. Black Canary disagrees, unless they’re going to chop his body up and run it through a processor. Dr. Mid-Nite explains that’s <i>exactly</i> what they’re going to do. Black Canary, shocked, says she’s going to sit by the car. As they perform the autopsy, they scan the body and find nothing unusual. Dr. Mid-Nite then sees something strange. He compares this autopsy from the one done before and explains that the cells from the autopsy done now has less tissue from his upper thigh, which means it’s no Oliver Queen’s DNA, and the cells are still reactive. Batman asks what that means; does it mean the cells are still alive? Dr. Mid-Nite explains that they’re dead, but they’ll become active once again if activated. He sticks a contraption with a needle on the end, and Oliver dissipates into someone else: Everyman. Black Canary adds that he’s a shapeshifter, and that they have to find Oliver if he’s still alive. Batman says that they need to find out who has him first before they can begin their search. Batman questions Black Canary, asking her if anyone strange has approached her since Oliver’s “death”. Black Canary thinks, and thinks of the Amazons.</p><p> </p><p>On Themyscira, the Amazons have held Oliver captive.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>This 8-part epic explores the underbelly of the DC Universe and ties in to COUNTDOWN! Frank Tieri and COUNTDOWN's J. Calafiore team up to deliver an action-packed tale that features Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Batwoman and just about every other Gotham guest-star imaginable. As more and more evildoers seemingly disappear into thin air, Gotham City finds itself in the midst of a villainous vacuum. Who will rise to commandeer the remainder of Gotham's rogues? As several factions scramble to stake their claim, Batman and friends strategize a counter-attack!</i></p> <p>Man-Bat is flying through Gotham City, and some special agents are capturing him. One warns the others that if Man-Bat flies through the open city, then they will fail their mission. One fires a net and captures Man-Bat and he falls to the floor. They approach him and are about to put him into the truck when he breaks free and bane punches Man-Bat out.</p> <p>Meanwhile, James Gordon has signalled the Bat Signal and says, “You need practice.” He refers to Robin’s sneak, and how it needs more practice. Robin replies that he’ll work on it. Down below, there are some thugs and some sort of riot, with the police obviously not being able to control it. James Gordon explains how crime activity has erupted after Black Mask’s death. And with no one to take over, all gangs are going for the position. Things are heating up while Gordon continues explaining, with the police warning them to calm down. Gordon says that this will definitely turn into another gang war, worse than before. Shots are fired and Robin jumps down, while Gordon comments on his entry: “Passable at best.”</p> <p>Elsewhere, Bruce Wayne is undercover as Matches Malone. Even though Matches Malone is just another disguise over his real self, he finds this one much more liberating, being able to rough up thugs in which otherwise Batman couldn’t do. Penguin comments on his style: “I like that.” Matches calls Penguin “boss” and he says he would have never thought of saying that. He then continues with his thoughts on how he never thought it would be necessary to infiltrate Penguin’s nightclub under his guise; the nightclub called The <b>Iceberg Lounge</b>; the official place to meet all the criminals in Gotham City. He comments on the high prices of the drinks here, but not as much as the criminal activities being discussed. “Ya got those guns we talked about?”, “Wait fifteen minutes then meet me by the car.”, “… And I need it to look like an accident.”, “I need to move a lot of product in a hurry, no questions asked.”, “You’ll get handsomely take care of, I promise you.” Matches then continues with his thoughts, as he wants Penguin to fill in Black Mask’s spot. He continues to explain that the Iceberg Lounge has been kidnapping criminals, by bringing them here with their “entertainment shows”. But Matches has a clue that it was The Suicide Squad kidnapping the criminals. He doesn’t know why their interest in Penguin is connected to the rumours that he has started some kind of underground place for criminals. Either way, he intends to get to the bottom of this.</p> <p>“Is this seat taken?” asks Two-Face. Penguin spits his drink out and greets him nervously. Two-Face realises this new underground thing. Captain Boomerang knows too, and so does the Riddler. Two-Face wants to know about this underground thing, and threatens Penguin to tell him. Penguin gives in and spills the beans. He tells him to meet him after closing.</p> <p>Outside the club, Alfred wants to get in, but is stopped by the bodyguard because he doesn’t recognise Alfred. Alfred then plays the pity man, and tells him that he wishes to wager on Batman… and brings out a wad of cash. The bodyguard then lets him in. But Nightwing is behind the bodyguard and slams his head against the metal door. He walks in, as if he is a guest in the club and everyone is surprised that a lone hero would walk into a villain hideout. All of the bodyguards bring out their guns and starts bringing them down. While Nightwing is taking care of the bodyguards, the bartender is brings out his own gun, with Nightwing oblivious to him. A bottle crashes against his head, and Alfred has saved the day. Nightwing then comments on how simple goons could have gotten these weapons. Nightwing then surmises that there’s a new player in town. </p> <p>It then cuts to a restaurant, where some thug dealings are happening. The bosses of each of the two gangs are discussing on how to take out all the thugs and finally take the Black Mask spot. One thug boss, called Odessas says he wants to east side, because that side makes more money. But the other thug boss refuses, as he claims that they have had the east side for many generations. Then another thug boss, called Tobias Whale comes in and stabs them both with his harpoon arrow and introduces himself. He continues to talk, and says that they should thank him for removing the two immovable objects that were preventing them from taking over Gotham City. He explains that because of scenes like that is why they are never able to get a real leader around here. He tells them that with the next few days, he will be arranging a meeting between all the heads of the Gotham crime families.</p> <p>Back in the Iceberg Lounge, Matches adds that he Hugo Strange, Scarecrow and the Mad Hatter have now joined, saying how they are scared. He comments on Penguin, and how he likes it like that, and how he enjoys taking advantage of it, manipulating whoever he wants under his thumb. But Matches wants that, at least until he can figure out what happening in Gotham City. His city. And that’s why he’s Matches this time, not Batman. Matches would allow him to fall back on something soft, unlike his cowl and cape counterpart, suddenly the Suicide Squad breaks in and captures all the criminals in the lounge. Matches comments on how this is their second appearance, and he too gets hit behind the head by Bane.</p>",

Superstars Ed Brubaker (UNCANNY X-MEN, CAPTAIN AMERICA) and Marc Silvestri (UNCANNY X-MEN, NEW X-MEN) bring you the first chapter of the story that fans will be talking about for years.</i></p><p><i>Just when it looked like there was no possibility of a future for mutants, hope arrives. But the X-Men aren’t there to meet it—The Marauders and Purifiers beat them to it.</i></p><p><i>Now the race is on to get the first new mutant since HOUSE OF M!</i></p><p><i>The story that begins here continues through all the X-Men books. Don’t miss it!</i></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Professor X locates the birth of a new Mutant in the small town of Cooperstown, Alaska. This birth marks a milestone because it is the first mutant child born since the Scarlet Witch de-powered over 90% of the worlds mutant population on M-Day. The instant loss of millions of mutants made mutant kind an endangered species, the mutant X-Gene being \"erased\" from those who were de-powered (including all stored samples of mutant DNA), as well as no other mutant children having been born since.</p><p>The birth of the mutant occured while Professor X was discussing the mutant crisis with Beast and searching out all current mutants with Cerebro. The psychic feedback resulting from the mutants birth overloaded both Professor X's brain as well as Cerebro, frying the powerful computer. It also caused a power surge within the mansion which caused all lights within the mansion to explode and power to be lost. An event of such importance would surely get the attention of others, and Xavier quickly gathered a small group of experienced X-Men to travel to Alaska in the Blackbird. The team consisted of Angel, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Emma Frost, and Cyclops. When they arrived in Cooperstown they found the town burning and virtually all of its inhabitants either dead or wounded.</p><p>While trying to rescue the remaining inhabitants and piece together exactly what had transpired the X-Men found the dead bodies of several Purifiers as well as the shattered body of the Prism. Emma Frost scanned the mind of one of the survivors to discover that the Purafiers had been dispatched to kill all children of the town in order to make sure that they had killed the new mutant. Sinister's Marauders, including former X-Men Gambit and Sunfire stopped the Purafiers and left to locate the new mutant. It was then that the X-Men learned that the new mutant was just born rather than a teenager. This confusion is expected as mutant powers typically manifest around puberty, not from birth. The X-Men departed Alaska to plan their next move, not knowing that the geneticaly-engineered mutant hunting monstor Predator X just arrived in Cooperstown. Predator X was created to hunt and feed upon powerful mutants, and it is hungy for the new child.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The prestigious Mythos format returns as we find out how Marvel’s First Family became the team they are today! Paul Jenkins tells the tale while Paolo Rivera delivers the beautiful fully painted origin of the FANTASTIC FOUR!</em></p><p>The group, before they were known as the Fantastic Four, are at a meeting to recount what happened. The point of this session was to decide whether the public would be safe for the public.</p><p>Reed Richards recounts the beginnings, saying that it started at breakfast. Ben Grimm was serving eggs as Sue Storm comments on the eggs, asking if they really were eggs. Meanwhile, Johnny Storm is outside having fun with the spacesuit. Inside, Grimm comments on how Johnny is going to get himself killed, and asks about the solar storm. He also wonders about their communication systems, hoping they will not get knocked out. Reed, in his science talk, talks about how it is highly unlikely that it would happen. Grimm is still unconvinced as he comments on the equipment being quite sensitive, and the fact that the Russians wouldn’t be too happy if they destroyed it all.</p><p>At the meeting, Congressman Sen Buntz questions where Johnny was, and asks him if he was outside. Johnny confirms that. Another congressman asks if he was doing a maintenance check, and Johnny uneasily asks if he gets to plead the fifth amendment.</p><p>Outside the spaceship, Johnny was out having fun with the spacesuit rather than doing maintenance checks. In the spaceship, Sue calls for Johnny, but says that he turned his intercom off. He asks Grimm if he could bring him inside himself. Grimm asks him to come inside, but Johnny says he can’t hear him. Inside, Sue says that the sensor is acting up. Reed says that that can’t be right as the solar storm is meant to happen tomorrow. Outside, Grimm is getting audio interference. It turns out that Johnny didn’t turn off his intercom in the first place – it was rather the solar storm causing this interference. Grimm realises what is happening and rush to get inside, while Reed tells them to enter the escape shuttle rather than the main body of the ship. Johnny sees the solar storm and is awe. Their intercoms buzz of interference. Reed opens up the outer bay doors to the escape shuttle as Grimm is struggling to reel Johnny in with him. But it’s too late as the solar storm destroys the ship. Each of them has their own thoughts while this is happening. Sue wishes she could make herself disappear, Reed wishes she could reach for Sue, Grimm was angry because he didn’t want to die like this, and Johnny thought was <strong><em>hot</em></strong>.</p><p>At the control station, they lose contact with them, and see the escape shuttle from the sky. Everything is in a rush as emergency teams tend to the injured four. The radiation team survey the area and one comments on the amount of radiation in there, as shown by the Geiger counter.</p><p>Back at the meeting, one congressman asks that if the reactor was compromised, wouldn’t one of them have to pilot the ship manually before switching the autopilot? He also asks whether they could have preserved the research material or not. Sue interjects, and explains that if they stayed there, they would have died, and asks them to show them the alpha and theta waves as they themselves had not predicted it. If they could, they would have escaped immediately, or would have been prepared. The congresswoman interjects, asking them how they had piloted the ship of everybody was unconscious. Reed explains that they simply don’t know, and that they don’t know what happened up there.</p><p>It cuts back to a flashback, and all of them are at the hospital, with Sue and Reed watching over Grimm, who seems to be in an intense state. Reed feels that it’s all his fault, as he had miscalculated, but Sue disagrees, saying that he can’t predict the future, even with a brilliant mind like that. Meanwhile, Johnny is experiencing his powers, as the nurse comments on the thermometer and how it’s broken. In another room, Grimm wakes up and gets into a rage and sees himself. Sue disappears, Reed’s arms stretch and Johnny has flames produced near on his face. Grimm, in a rage, destroys the hospital equipment in a rage. Grimm pushes Reed away, and almost gets crushed by the hospital equipment, but is saved. Reed asks if that’s Sue, and uses his hand to feel for her. Sue says that “that’s not my arm”. Grimm, in a confused state, asks what’s happened to his skin when Johnny flies in with flames all over him.</p><p>At the meeting, a congresswoman comments that Grimm had not been able to reform and wonders if that is a safety concern for the public. Reed says that she has always known him to be a man of his word and promises to use these abilities for good. The congresswoman questions if that doesn’t happen, and Reed replies that he will attempt to address the situation, and adds that they shouldn’t be treated differently, as they have had no criminal records. Sue asks Reed what’s going to happen, and Reed isn’t too sure. As they make their way to the lobby, Reed says that he’s purchased the old Baxter building and asks Sue if she would like to join him. Johnny agrees, and so does Grimm, much like family. As they exit the building, Johnny sings <em>We Are Family</em> and Grimm tells him to shut up.</p>",

To the criminals he terrorizes and the citizens he protects, Fear is a bold, even reckless superhero. To those who know his secret, he’s a man paralyzed by a crippling anxiety disorder, who needs an anti-fear drug to fight his war on crime. But what happens when his supply runs out?   <p>The story begins with Adam Rygert standing atop a building, trying to convince himself he is not afraid. He has a momentary flashback to a childhood birthday partner where he was mortified for being too afraid to jump from the diving board. He overcomes the flash back, puts his helmet on, and lets the mysterious gas run through his helmet and into his breathing area. The gas brings on a change in Adam and he easily dives off the building and flies off. HE comes to the docks and find criminal activity. During the tussle one of the villains cracks his helmet, releasing the gas. He dives out the window and uses an inhaler to get another hit of the gas then enters the battle again. When he succeeds he flies away but one of the nearby homeless people obtain a small portion of his drug and starts to use it.</p> <p>During the news coverage we meet Becky Edwards, a reporter and childhood friend of Adam. She talks highly of Adam's alter-ego Fear; however, she is quickly cut off by a police officer. Adam has another flashback to his childhood with Becky and how he had such a huge crush on her that he missed three days of school after talking to her. Now, however, they are going out and she knows he is secretly Fear. She does seem to question why he thinks it's his responsibility though. He starts to have an asthma-attack and then explains that the town was once safe and he feels he can make it again.</p> <p>He has a final flashback to the day he met Lionel, his tutor that would go on to make the drug he uses as fear. Lionel scolds him for being so careless the day prior. They head into a secret lair where he keeps the drug. He reveals a concern that his time is limited and someday Ryan will need to learn to make the drug. Ryan argues that he should go public with it, but Lionel disagrees saying it may fall into the wrong hands.</p> <p>In another house Victor, the head of the criminal activity in the area, is angered by Fear's action and exclaims he'll need to deal with him personally. A man arrives and says he could help and that he knows Fear's weakness.</p> <p>Back at Adam's mansion, we see that Adam was thrown out of his own restaurant. It is also revealed that his father is deceases and, according to his butler, he is not doing a very good job of living up to his legacy. Becky calls him to give him a tip about some activity. Adam heads out as Fear but this time the villains are actually a distraction. He deals with them very easy. Prior to the battle he had tried to contact Lionel with no luck, so afterward he went to his house to see what had happened. When he arrived, he found the house trashed and a message that said \"I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.\"</p>",

            "description": "<p>Titans Tower is back up and running on the East Coast as Judd Winick, Ian Churchill and Norm Rapmund assemble an explosive new team of Titans under the leadership of Cyborg! But their first mission may be their last as powerful forces gather to destroy all Titans past and future!</p><p>Back during the Teen Titans' original line-up, they faced off against the Joker. He had one of his crazy plans that involved teaming up with Bizarro and kidnapping a female pop singer. Things aren't looking too good but Kid Flash manages to snag the giant gun pointed held at the singer's head away from the Joker. To Wally's surprise, it isn't a normal gun. Inside there is a bomb set to go off. As he runs to move the bomb away from civilians, it goes off 3 seconds early.</p><p>Thinking that Kid Flash is gone, Raven engulfs the Joker inside of her to force him to face his worst fears. It turns out that the Joker's fears don't scare him but rather make him laugh hysterically.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donna and Starfire continue to try to break free of Bizarro's deadly grasp. After Donna gives him a hard kick to the face, Bizarro responds by throwing her far away. Left alone, Starfire thinks about the fact that Bizarro is the opposite of Superman. Knowing that Superman derives his strength from the yellow sun, she surmises that it would have the opposite affect on Bizarro. She creates a sun blast and Bizarro is left withered. He still contains the strength to injure Kory.</p><p>All this has given Kid Flash the time he needed to find some blue Kryptonite from one of the locations that Robin suggested. With Bizarro finally defeated, Robin finishes things by taking Joker out with a haymaker blow. \"Titans Together! Together Forever!\"</p><p>Today. Cyborg is trying to start a new team of Titans. He calls his former teammates but they all have reasons and excuses not to join him. It's Nightwing that finally asks Victor if any of the old team has said yes to him. He also asks who are the new team members.</p><p>The new team consists of Hawk and Dove, Power Boy, Anima, Little Barda, Lagoon Boy, and Son of Vulcan. They are the new Titans East.</p><p>Cyborg has them all assembled together and tells them that they will be judged on how they perform together. Power Boy is a little put off by the fact that they are basically trying out for the team. For their first mission, Cyborg wants them to \"nail [Power Boy's] butt to a wall.\"</p><p>Power Boy sets off. Anima is the first to attempt to grab him. He easily throws her off his back. Next Lagoon Boy grabs hold of Power Boy. Power Boy makes fun of him and holds him in a headlock. Lagoon Boy responds by expanding like a puffer fish, sticking Power Boy in places that shouldn't be mentioned. Little Barda takes her shot by delivering a sharp blow to his head. Slamming down into a tree, Power Boy barely manages to avoid a deadly blow by Vulcan's sword. Power Boy claps his hands together and the shockwave sends Vulcan and Little Barda flying back.</p><p>Hawk and Dove decide to take their turn. As Power Boy swings at Hawk and as she manages to stop his punch, she reveals that she's the one he was with the night before (and had her role play as Supergirl). Hawk's punch sends Power Boy flying into the woods. The team runs towards the trees but it's Dove that makes them stop momentarily. She mentions that they haven't been performing as a team and that is why Power Boy has been avoiding their attacks. Shouting out orders, they coordinate a move to surround Power Boy in the woods.</p><p>To their shock, they find Power Boy, impaled on a tree branch. The tree is smoking with some bits of flame and Power Boy's body is half burnt also. As the rest come to realize that someone else is there, blasts start coming at them. Dove and Little Barda are hit. Vulcan puts up a shield but is still shot through it, at the same time that Lagoon Boy is. Cyborg runs towards them yelling for someone to report what is going on.</p><p>Victor is dismayed to find the entire group lying in smoking heaps on the ground. Knowing that he's got to get medical attention there right way, he looks up to see an enormous fireball coming straight down on top of him.</p><p>All that is left is Cyborg's upper torso in a giant burnt crater. This appears to be the end of the Titans East.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>THIS IS IT! The official continuation of the Angel TV series!</p><p>When last we saw Angel and company, they were charging into battle against Wolfram and Hart's Senior Partners and facing down endless demons in a dark and rainy alleyway. Now, IDW Publishing is proud to present the story of Angel: After the Fall, as presented by Angel co-creator Joss Whedon, with a creative team hand-picked by Whedon himself, the Spike: Shadow Puppets team of Brian Lynch and Franco Urru.</p><p>Picking up where Season Five of the fan-favorite TV show ended, the first issue in this maxi-series looks at who lived after that climactic battle, who died, and what happened to all of Los Angeles in its wake. Acclaimed artist Tony Harris (Ex Machina) and Urru provide special covers for each issue of this momentous series. Issue 1 features a full 27 pages of story and art!</p><p>On a street in LA a girl and two men are looting a store when they're suddenly attacked by a demon. But before the demon can do any harm, Angel appears wielding a sword. He cuts down the attacking demon and starts working on its friends. The demons quickly recover, drop Angel to the ground and start tearing into his body. Things look bad but then out of nowhere a dragon appears and burns the demons to a crisp. Throughout his fight Angel had been recapping the events that brought him to the point he's at now, saying that he'd made some bad choices and ending up working for an evil organization. The dragon had also been part of that organization and two minutes into fighting it he had realized that it had been just as misled as he. Now they work together.</p><p>With the threat dealt with Angel turns his attention to the humans. He tells them to take the car his dragon had brought and head to address he hands them on a slip of paper. The people wonder what's been going on and though Angel knows why the world is as it is, he doesn't tell them. He just hops on his dragon and flies away. As the dragon flies over the city he goes over what he isn't telling anyone. Things are like they are because he and his friends took a stand and Wolfram and Hart sent an army. Both sides suffered losses and Wolfram and Hart sent LA to hell. Now demons ran the city. They had quickly conquered and divided it, and now they owned it, everything but the Wolfram and Hart offices where Angel and his dragon live.</p><p>The dragon reaches their home and Angel tells it to grab some cars for the night rounds. As he goes inside a demon grabs him and slams him into a wall. It's Burge, Lord of Downtown LA and his son. Burge has come because Angel's latest escapade took place in his territory. As Burge's son gets angrier (it was his men who had been killed) he prepares to do something rash when Wesley Wyndham-Price walks through the door. While Burge's son holds Angel, Wesley and Burge have a talk. Wesley says that Wolfram and Hart don't approve of Angel's actions and he will be punished, but not by Burge. Angel's fate isn't up to him and if Angel dies, bad things will happen to everyone else. Burge leaves but swears that if Angel leaves the building again that night or kills any more of his men, he'll be coming back for his head. Or his desk. Burge really likes the desk. Burge's son still wants to kill Angel but since he can't he decides to take a swing at Wesley. The demon is surprised to see that the man is intangible and quickly flies off. When the demons are all gone, Wesley asks Angel how his rounds went and learns that he saved about a dozen people and sent that all to the usual place.</p><p>In Santa Monica the last three people that Angel saved make their way to an old hotel that was apparently where Angel sent them. The two guys are wary of the place, not entirely trusting that Angel was a good guy, but the girl believes he was so they go inside. When they open the doors they see a room full of humanoid demons and people with weapons. The guys really want to leave but before they can lightning fills the air around them. A girl in red appears and tells them they're just trying to see if they're on the up-and-up. The lightning fades and then another girl appears from the darkness and starts smelling them and even licks the girl. She freaks out but Nina (the girl that did the licking) explains that she's a werewolf and since the sun and moon are out all the time in hell, it has an affect on her. From out of the darkness someone else appears and tells Nina and Gwen (responsible for the lightning) to calm down, the new arrivals were sent by Angel so they're good. Then he gives them his name. It's Connor.</p><p>Back and the offices of Wolfram and Hart, Angel is laying on a table with some kind of creature on his chest. Wesley says it's supposed to heal him but Angel is not happy about using it. Angel asks why Wesley wasn't around when he came back and was attacked by Burge and his son, and Wesley said he wanted to see Angel's next move which ended up being \"squirm\". Angel then explains why he couldn't really do anything about Burge. If he killed Burge and his son, every demon would be fighting to take over his position as Lord and numerous humans would die. Angel goes on to say that he wishes he had been able to take out the demons as they popped up, but he had been unable to move for the first few days (or weeks possibly) after LA had been sent to hell. Now all he can do is save small groups of humans (without upsetting the senior partners of Wolfram and Hart). He's working on a plan though, all he needs is the right firepower. Wesley gives a response that tells a little about his position now. He says he'd give anything to leave and be able to move on, indicating that he did die at the end of Angel but the senior partners had prevented his soul from passing on so he could do their work and continue to get Angel to work for them. Then he says that if Angel doesn't get some control, the wrong person is going to. As he says this, Angel is looking at a picture of his \"firepower\", some kind of orb.</p><p>The orb is elsewhere at the moment. Specifically, in the chest in the jelly-like Lord of Westwood. The creature sits on a throne in an arena surrounded by girls, other demons and Betta George, a telepathic fish. On his throne, the Lord of Westwood is yelling idiotically at some humans to get them to fight. When they won't, he orders Betta George to telepathically force them to fight. The fish says he doesn't have that much power so the Lord of Westwood imparts him some power from the orb in his chest and Betta George reluctantly forces the humans to start slaughtering each other. In the middle of the gladiatorial brawl a group of angry, armed and hooded strangers enters the arena. Suddenly a weighted bag slams into George's head knocking him out and the attackers advance upon Lord Kr'ph himself. Kr'ph sends his demon lackeys to fight and they willingly put themselves in harms way for their master, but as one of the attackers says, their fighting ability leaves something to be desired. The attackers easily slice through the demon defenses and amid the fight their hoods are dropped and the leader is revealed to be none other than Gunn. Kr'ph has, at this point, turned from threats to bargaining but Gunn knows what he wants and has no problem taking it. He sticks a hand into Kr'ph and rips out the orb from his dying body. With the main bad guy dead, the other demons fall soon after leaving Gunn and his team standing in a field of corpses. No demons are left so Gunn has his men wrap up the fish and Gunn brings the girls back to wherever \"Team Gunn\" is hiding out.</p><p>Back at the offices of Wolfram and Hart, Angel is putting a sword away when he hears someone or something outside yelling \"six for six\". Apparently it's Burge's son again and he's saying that he gets to kill six humans because Angel killed six of his men. Angel stands on the edge of his building remembering that he was told not to leave and watches the demons circle the humans. As Burge's son is about to kill a human, Angel throws his desk outside as recompense. When the demon flies up at Angel, the man takes out a stake and throws it into his eye, a declaration of war.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Gunn's men are writing something arcane on the walls and body cover the floor. The corpses seem to be the people they saved before and they all have bite marks on their necks. Around the corner, Gunn, now a vampire, is draining one of the rescued girls.</p>",

The leader of the world's deadliest terror organization is also the lawful ruler of Wolverine's old stomping ground: the island nation of Madripoor. Unable to depose her openly, S.H.I.E.L.D. sends in its best man to secretly take her down. His name? Stark...Tony Stark. But with his Extremis powers blocked and his Iron Man armor hovering in orbit for emergencies only, can the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. survive against enemies like Bloodscream and Roughhouse, who've nearly killed Wolverine himself? Wizard's 2007 Writer to Watch, Christos Gage (Iron Man), and in his stunning Marvel debut, artist Harvey Tolibao (Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic), bring you a roller coaster ride of action and espionage that will change Madripoor forever!</em></p><p>Stark briefs SHIELD on Madame Hydra and Madripoor and his plan to enact a regime change. Checking into a Madripoor hotel, Stark is greeted by Madame Hydra who injects him with an Extremis-blocking compound &amp; GPS tracking unit. Before the compound takes effect, Stark disables the GPS, then spurns Madame Hydra's advances. Upset, she kisses a bellboy, killing him whith her poisoned lipstick. Cleaning the room of bugs, Stark and his agents go to Lowtown and start a bar fight where undercover agent Huang tells Stark how to contact Tyger Tiger.</p><p>Bloodscream and Roughhouse attempt to kill Stark and agents but fail, destroying the bar in the process. Madame Hydra arrives, claiming that Huang tried to kill Stark, so she executes him. Returning to the hotel, Stark is attacked by Hydra agents. He and the agents escape using H.A.W.K. suits, leaving a bomb for HYDRA. They set down in the jungle and are found by Tyger Tiger who is initially hesitant to openly challenge Madame Hydra for Madripoor's crown until Stark convinces her to try by showing her a secret Hydra weapons lab.</p><p>Later, Stark confronts Madame Hydra at the Royale Palace, challenging her to a duel and goading her into confessing her contempt for Madripoor in front of a jury-rigged camera that's broadcasting live.

But it's not the world of 2007…it's the world of Europe, circa 1000 AD. The world of Brian Wood's brand-new monthly series, NORTHLANDERS. Following the red-hot success of one of last year's most critically-acclaimed books, DMZ, NORTHLANDERS is a fresh take on Vikings.<br /><br /></i> <p><i>NORTHLANDERS tells the epic tale of Sven, an exiled Viking prince who's been living the decadent, high life in Constantinople - the 11th century's answer to Las Vegas - but now must return to the desolate lands of his birth in the frigid islands of the North Sea to reclaim his vast inheritance. Intending only to take his money and run, he finds more than he bargained for as his former family and friends are enslaved at the hands of Gorm, his ruthless uncle. What follows isnot only a bloody quest to free his people, but also a young man's struggle to discover where he belongs in a rapidly changing world…and what awful sacrifices it will take to make a Prince into a King.</i></p> <p><i>NORTHLANDERS has all the cool, modern sensibilities audiences have come to expect from Wood (DMZ, Demo, Supermarket) mixed with the bloody action of 300 and Gladiator. Joining Wood on this epic journey is outstanding newcomer artist Davide Gianfelice and acclaimed cover artist Massimo Carnevale (Y: THE LAST MAN).</i></p>",

Now, no longer under the auspices of S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony Stark is forced to face the reality of his team's newfound freedom. Having gotten his hands on Nick Fury's personal files, Tony sifts through the information Nick has collected about the Ultimates’ adventures and discovers there's been a lot more going on with his team than he ever anticipated. This 32-page special will also include an extra four-page section featuring an all-new story by C.B. Cebulski and superstar Travis Charest.</em></p>",

In Civil War: Choosing Sides, five stories shine a spotlight on the wildcards and impact players whose part in the Civil War has yet to be told - including Daredevil/Iron Fist, U.S.Agent, the Irredeemable Ant-Man, Venom and even... Howard the Duck? Then in Winter Soldier: Winter Kills, James Buchanan Barnes, Captain America's one-time partner Bucky, faces his first Christmas of the 21st century - and the truth of the terrible things he was forced to do as the Winter Soldier. And with Cap caught in a conflict he can neither take a side of - or understand - what moves can he make to try to redeem himself? Later, in Civil War: The Return, two of the universe's greatest heroes are confronted with pasts they can't leave behind in two heart-rendering tales. On Earth, the Sentry confronts his inner demons as the shadows of past and future battles tear him apart. Within The Negative Zone, the walls of 42 are pulled back to reveal the return of one of the Marveldom's greatest heroes. And in She-Hulk, Civil War threatens the rights of every American super hero. So whose side will Marvel's top superhuman lawyer fight for? And how can she possibly choose, when she feels one way as She-Hulk, and another as Jen Walters? Collects Winter Soldier: Winter Kills, Civil War: Choosing Sides, Civil War: The Return and She-Hulk (2005) #8.</em></p>",

England in the mid-1950s is not the same as it was. The powers that be have instituted some changes. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen have been disbanded and disavowed, and the country is under the control of an iron-fisted regime. Now, after many years, the still youthful Mina Murray and a rejuvenated Allan Quatermain return in search of some answers — answers that can only be found in a book buried deep in the vaults of their old headquarters — a book that holds the key to the hidden history of the League throughout the ages: The Black Dossier. As Allan and Mina delve into the details of their precursors, some dating back centuries, they must elude their dangerous pursuers who are hellbent on retrieving the lost manuscript…and ending the League once and for all. THE BLACK DOSSIER is an elaborately designed, cutting-edge volume that includes a \"Tijuana Bible\" insert and a 3-D section complete with custom glasses, as well as additional text pieces, maps, and a stunning cutaway double-page spread of Captain Nemo's Nautilus submarine by Kevin O'Neill.

            "description": "<i>The feral X-Man fights along in four standalone stories! In The Package, Logan must escape from an army of savage killers Deep in the heart of war-torn Africa - with a baby strapped to his chest! The infant daughter of an overthrown monarch is the only hope for a country's future, and the conquering warlord is determined to see her dead. Can Wolverine get her to the border alive? Or will his greatest failure doom an entire nation? In Better To Give, a heavily armed suicide cult - clad in elf outfits - has taken hostage a mid-Manhattan department store on Christmas Eve and is threatening to blow the place sky high. Among the shoppers: Logan, who's just itching to sink his (Santa) claws into someone after enduring the Yuletide rush. Should be easy for a damn-near invulnerable force of nature to save the day, right? Think again. All is not as it seems, as a spoiled billionaire's daughter is about to find out, and the true meaning of Christmas will be spelt out... in blood. In The House of Blood and Sorrow, Wolverine lies at the edge of death in a rural Nebraska cornfield after crashing to Earth in the wake of a clash with a giant robot at the edge of the atmosphere, lapsing in and out of a coma as his body desperately tries to heal. And that's when things really get bad. The men who sent the robot to destroy Wolverine have come to finish the job. The townsfolk who witnessed the crash have gathered up a mob to hunt down and destroy the alien that's landed. And Wolverine's fate just might rest in the hands of the strange little girl who first found him in that dark cornfield. A strange little girl with an affinity for taking care of odd creatures - and whose family holds a deep, dark secret hidden from the light of day. And in \"The Healing,\" Logan lies gutted in a Northwest forest, surrounded by wolves and clinging onto hope and sanity as his body goes about the complicated work of repairing itself. It's not as easy as you might think. Collects Wolverine #41 and #49, Giant-Size Wolverine #1 and X-Men Unlimited #12 <br /></i>",

Equal parts blistering battle action, sensuous soap opera and pitch-black satire in the vein of PREACHER and TRANSMETROPOLITAN, Army@Love is unlike anything Veitch - or any other comics creator - has ever attempted.

But in the aftermath of the big blow-out, things start to go horribly wrong for all of them. Jessie is troubled by nasty memories she's been suppressing for years, while her best friend Nick Philo has become an un-person: Nobody outside their tight-knit little clique can remember seeing him before, and his records have been erased from the college's computers. At first, it doesn't seem like a big deal, but it becomes increasingly obvious that one of them is not what he appears to be. Chock full of ruthless characters with hidden agendas, FAKER takes place during freshman year in college; the ultimate time of reinvention, where, if you're up for it, you can lie, cheat and fake your way through almost anything.  </i>",

Shuuya's Japan is a ruthless military dictatorship where rock'n roll is illegal and children are routinely subjected to nightmarish televised reality shows where they are forced to kill each other—or be killed instead. Even so, Shuuya, Yoshi, Noriko, and the rest of these young people are basically normal, with their ordinary dreams and secret shames. On the eve of their graduation, the forty two students of Class B think they are going to celebrate. Instead, they awaken on an abandoned island and informed by a smarmy but ruthless “Teacher” that they are now officially playing The Game…and only one of them will make it out alive!</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 1: The Worst Game in History</li><li>Chapter 2: Best Friend</li><li>Chapter 3: Shinji Mimura</li><li>Chapter 4: The Oath</li><li>Chapter 5: Other Side of the Door</li><li>Chapter 6: Yoshio Akamatsu</li><li>Chapter 7: Trust</li><li>Chapter 8: Mitsuko Souma</li><li>Chapter 9: Kazuo Kiriyama (Part One)</li><li>Chapter 10: Kazuo Kiriyama (Part Two)</li><li>Chapter 11: Treasure</li><li>Chapter 12: Those Who Come Forth</li><li>Chapter 13: Shogo Kawada</li><li>Chapter 14: Nightmare</li><li>Chapter 15: Conditions</li><li>Chapter 16: The Right Thing To Do</li><li>Sidestory: Energy</li><li>Chapter 17: Past</li><li>Chapter 18: Odds</li><li>Chapter 19: Problem Child</li><li>Chapter 20: Acceptance</li><li>Chapter 21: Forfeiture</li><li>Chapter 22: Battle Plan</li><li>Chapter 23: The Ultimate Team</li><li>Chapter 24: Takako Chigusa</li><li>Side Story: Fallen Angel</li></ul>",

It is the chronicle of a girlhood and adolescence at once outrageous and familiar, a young life entwined with the history of her country yet filled with the universal trials and joys of growing up.</i></p><p><i>Edgy, searingly observant, and candid, often heartbreaking but threaded throughout with raw humor and hard-earned wisdom--Persepolis is a stunning work from one of the most highly regarded, singularly talented graphic artists at work today.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>America is covered in snow. Cities that were once blessed with continual sunshine have a white blanket covering them. But the cold is the least of the population's problems. In Los Angeles rival gangs fight it out for control of what was previously known as the City of Angels. Law and order has completely collapsed and the government, stretched thin as it is by troubles elsewhere, is afraid it will lose the city.Unfortunately, back up is light, and the beleaguered military can only send four marines to turn the tide. Fortunately, they are all that is needed. One of these four, Ricky Di Santos, is returning to his birthplace, the city he left to escape a girl he once loved. But they are destined to meet again, this time on the battlefield.</em></p><p>The series is broken up into four stories, each centered on one of the four main characters and all set in locations that it would be hard to imagine covered in snow. Major Jonathon Carson seeks out his lost son in the icy tundra of Las Vegas, Ricky Di Santos finds himself meeting an old flame in the battlefield of a snow covered Los Angeles, Jed Giffin catches up with his self-centered sister in a freezing Dallas and Sinead O Brien takes to the frozen seas of Miami with a friend from her former life. Each story looks at the suffering caused in these very different settings and examines how people cope in an environment where each day is a struggle for survival. However, there is also plenty of action as the marines deal with those who would attempt to profit from this new world in which America finds itself.</p>",

The contents run from extended stories like Derek Hunter's 15-page Powerpuff Girls-esque goofy-girl-hero comic Gamma Rae to one-page posters and smirking faux-ads like Danny Hellman's sly, smirking ant-farm solicitation. While there are some kid-friendly stories, the tone runs generally darker, with ninja battles, noir murder mysteries, ghosts, vampires, monsters, zombies, and robot-on-robot violence cropping up amid the odd, alternative superheroes. Virtually all the work is colorful, entertaining, and immediate, with a strong sense of experimentation and play throughout; it's hard, in this rich an environment, for any one work to stand out. But Andy Kuhn's \"Mexican Wrestler Funnies,\" in which two wrestlers trade Monty Python-esque barbs like \"It is I who will make love to your corpse, with a Waring blender… set to puree!\" is pretty hilarious, and Adrian Dominguez and Matthew Weldon's anime-influenced teen-hero story \"Ellie Saves The World\" is particularly gorgeous. But then, the wide variety of tones and visual styles guarantees something for just about everyone… A- --The Onion AV Club</p><p>The sheer diversity in style of art, lettering, layout -- everything -- is enough to keep neophytes and nerds alike rapt. The work is at turns touching, hilarious, suspenseful and then some. This is a fine collection. 9/10 --Under the Radar Magazine</p><p>[POPGUN is] a comic book mixtape that will keep the art junkies very happy ... acrazy collection of cutting edge comic book art. POPGUN pulls selections from some of the top indie artists in comics ... Aspiring artists and fans will want to flip through POPGUN for the inspiring images that demonstrate just how much talent is floating around comics these days. --Blair Butler, G4's Attack of the Show</p>",

If that wasn’t enough, Priscilla has to adapt to a new high school, as well as deal with her spiteful cousin, Kitten. Kitten wishes she could shove Priscilla onto the next cargo plane back to America…so when the most popular boy in school (and the guy Kitten secretly loves) develops a crush on Priscilla, the needle of Kitten’s “Hate-O-Meter” flies in the red.</em></p><p><em>Priscilla’s only escape from the drama of this weird world is her diary, and soon she begins her funny and touching journey of learning how to deal with loss, love, popularity and--most important of all--food that bites back!</em></p>",

As a result, she has developed an outer shell, making her look tough and indifferent even with the constantly bullying. When she transfers to a different high school, a fresh start brings an array of new characters into her life: Queen Bee has a cool personality and the fighting skills to match, making her one of the most popular girls in school. And the irresistibly charming Cold Prince Ma-Hyun has the good looks to make the girls swoon.

His entire body wrapped in bloodstained bandages, at first glance he looks like an escaped nightmare, a macabre creature animated by unnatural means.</i><br /><br /><i>But this is no walking corpse. Oh, no--a heart beats strong and true within its skeletal cage, and the eyes...one look at the piercing eyes of this man, and you know he is more alive than most in this forsaken land. Whatever--whoever--ignited the fire behind his bloodshot eyes will rue the day he crosses their path. For this warrior may not mount a pale steed...but he'll follows his enemies just the same.<br /><br />Gyakushu! is a glorious lullaby to fans of the blood-soaked samurai story. The Thief, the tragic lead character in this tale, is a bandaged shell of a man whose sole purpose for living is to kill his way to the ones that destroyed all he loved. As we follow him on his journey, layer after layer of story is peeled back, revealing snippets of the past, as well as clues for the future. His quest for revenge will test not only his physical limits, but his emotional ones as well, as each kill brings him closer to his foes, but further from his humanity. If revenge is a forest filled with trees--the Thief will not stop until they are all reduced to kindling!</i>",

Romero-esque zombie comedy that he intends to be the middle installment of his \"horror trilogy\" begun with the Frankenstein monster love triangle of <b>You Can't Get There From Here</b>. Jason's elegant deadpan style somehow manages to make the gruesome gore and splatter effects almost... charming — and yes, it is a sweet love story at heart.

A fall down the stairs into the arms of a handsome stranger sets off the beginnings of an explanation, and it is one Norio never could have possibly imagined. Soon a whole new world opens up for Norio, revealing a secret society of special people evolved from animals other than monkeys. This society has a complex structure and its members are ranked by rarity and desirability, and it turns out that Norio is a particularly rare breed and his DNA is in much demand!

You’re better than other kids because you’re the child of a god and a mortal. As a demigod, you’ll get the best education a child of Greek, Norse, Japanese or Egyptian divinity can receive. Here at our Los Angeles based campus, you’ll study subjects ranging from Algebra to Mythstory under noted instructors such as Greece’s oldest mortal, Tithonus, and Japan’s mistress of combat, Ms. Hitomi Hachiman. And let’s not forget our very own Fighting Chimeras--divine league basketball champions two years running. Keep at ‘em, Coach Hercules! You may have heard prophecies or seen visions of a great doom looming over the school, but the End Of All Things is no excuse for tardiness and absences will go on your permanent record. The challenges at a school for demigods are great, but if anyone can face them it’s the students of...Pantheon High!</i></p>",

But during one play date, his mother notices that her son is slightly different from the other children. In the alternately heartwarming and bittersweet tale, a young mother tries to cope with both the overwhelming discovery of her child’s autism and the trials of raising him while keeping her family together. This is a story that resonates not only for those whose families have been affected by autism, but also for all past, present, and future parents.</i></p><h2>Back Blurb</h2><p><i>To new mother Sachiko Azuma, her baby boy is the light of her life. Accordingly, she names him Hikaru, Japanese for \"to be bright.\" Eager to raise her son, Sachiko gradually begins to notice that Hikaru seems a bit different from the other children. He is reluctant to be held or hugged, and his growth and development appear slow. Sachiko's suspicions are confirmed when it is suggested that Hikari, at a year-and-a-half, may be deaf. A specialist, however, reaches a different diagnosis: autism.</i></p><p><i>With the Light: Raising an Autistic Child is a simultaneously poignant and heartwarming story of a young mother attempting to cope with an increasingly common affliction. Originally published in Japan under the title Hikari To Tomoni, With the Light has been universally recognized for its sensitive portrayal of autism, winning an Excellence Prize for manga at the eighth annual Japan Media Arts Festival. The story also went on to be adapted as a television drama, which won Best Drama, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Newcomer awards at the forty-first Television Drama Academy Awards in Japan in 2004.This edition marks the first time With the Light has been made available to English-speaking audiences.</i></p><p>Collects and translates volumes 1 &amp; 2 of Hikari To Tomoni.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><h4>Birth/Infancy</h4><ul><li>Episode 1</li><li>Episode 2</li><li>Episode 3</li></ul><h4>Preschool Years</h4><ul><li>Episode 1</li><li>Episode 2</li><li>Episode 3</li></ul><h4>Early Elementary Years</h4><ul><li>Episode 1</li><li>Episode 2</li><li>Episode 3</li><li>Episode 4</li><li>Episode 5</li><li>Episode 6</li></ul><h4>With Dada by Dada's Mother, Ayako Okuhira (Text Only Story)<br />Nobu's World by Reiko Maruoka (Text Only Story)</h4>",

Featured in McSweeney's and on NPR's This American Life, and praised by comic luminaries Chris Ware and Daniel Clowes, Brown's work has always paid tribute to felines as they curl up on couches and purr on the peripheries of his autobiographical stories. Cat Getting Out of a Bag follows his cat Misty really, any cat as she goes about her everyday activities and adventures. In a series of drawings, Brown perfectly captures the universal charm of cats in a lovely book sure to please fans and cat lovers of any stripe.</p>",

In addition to the works written by Friedman, Fun includes many collaborations with his longtime partner K. Bidus, as well as Harvey Pekar (American Splendor), Mark Newgarden (We All Die Alone), and Bruce Handy, among others. Also included is artwork from the notorious Topps Bubble Gum Card series Toxic High, as well as art from the card sets Beauties and Cuties and Ed Wood Players. </em></p><p>Foreword by Daniel Clowes.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Things Just Get Away From You collects all of Holcombe's late-1990s comics work, with a bonus new story, \"Hails at Sea,\" thrown in for good measure.</i></p><p><i>Things Just Get Away From You leads off with \"King of Persia,\" a 1001 Nights/Yiddish vaudeville-inspired graphic novella in which king Faisal Al-Ghazali must win the affection of the woman he loves by traveling to an enchanted land in search of a giant emerald, while accompanied by his faithful companion, the talking camel, Jamila.</i></p><p><i>From the pages of Holcombe's short-lived but beloved comic book series Poot come four stories: \"Swollen Holler,\" a romance between two bugs whose supporting characters include an elderly bachelor, Professor Owl, and a lonely snail named Snail; \"The Eighth Wonder,\" a breezily suggestive, picaresque pantomime story featuring a romantically-inclined barrel-clad wanderer; \"The Red Grampus,\" in which the whaler captain Reginald Nubbins pursues an old enemy unleashed upon him by his first great love, the mysterious Julietta; and \"Count Stinkenpuss,\" in which the eponymous count wins the prestigious Tattersall Cat Show, only to have his prize-winning cat, Mr. Lovely, stolen by a vengeful ex-lover, resulting in a battle to the death in a dogfight over Mt. Kilimanjaro.</i></p><p><i>The book also includes \"What Do Pretty People Think About?,\" a pathetic bit of speculative envy in which Holcombe muses about the condition of physical beauty: What do pretty people think about? Do pretty people feel pain like normal people? Do pretty people even have souls? Finally, the all-new \"Hails at Sea\" is a collage of Holcombe's troubled dreams over a three-year period. Vampires, unfortunate sexual metaphors, talking fish and Tiny Tim all make an appearance in this tribute to the return of the repressed.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Among the many accomplishments in art and literature by Genevan Rodolphe Töpffer (1799-1846), his virtual invention of the comic strip, or graphic novel, stands out as the most surprising, curious, and to us, after a century inundated by comic strips, by far the most significant.</em></p><p><em>This volume is the first English-language version of the Töpffer comics oeuvre and includes (unlike previous French and German editions) all of his eight full-length stories, plus previously unpublished fragments of stories started and abandoned and manuscript segments omitted in the printed versions. Comics scholar Kunzle translates the captions from the French, gives essential biography and chronology, and appends socio-political contexts for all the stories with explanation of references obscure today. He deals with questions of dating and the differences among manuscript, printed version, and the various editions. He also lists the plagiaries, translations, and adaptations in other media.</em></p><p><em>Töpffer's complete comic strip output, combined with Kunzle's annotative material and analyses, makes this volume one of the most significant works of comics history to be published and reestablishes Töpffer's seminal place in the comics canon.</em></p><p><em>David Kunzle is author of <strong>From Criminal to Courtier: The Soldier in Netherlandish Art, 1550-1670</strong> and <strong>Decade of Protest: Political Posters from the United States, Vietnam, and Cuba, 1965-1975</strong>.</em></p>",

From the Venerable Vaults of Marveldom, it's the Mighty Marvel Handbook -- in the style of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s! Just what is a Legacy Handbook, you ask? Imagine a Handbook written during each of those decades. The profiles within each chapter cover everything published by the hallowed House of Ideas up until that point. So if it's from a comic that has a December 1969 cover date or earlier, you'll find it in the magnificent 1960s chapter! Featuring Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men and more across the ages -- as well as hundreds of other era-specific entries! Collecting MARVEL LEGACY: 1960s HANDBOOK, MARVEL LEGACY: 1970s HANDBOOK, MARVEL LEGACY: 1980s HANDBOOK and MARVEL LEGACY: 1990s HANDBOOK.</em></p>",

But despite it all, Jack longed for one thing that eluded him-the capture of his long-time archnemesis, Dr. Litigious Savant. On the fateful night when Jack's dream of cornering the elusive Savant is realized, things go terribly, dreadfully wrong, and Jack gets cut down to size by one of the doctor's insidious inventions . . . the size of your average action figure, to be exact.</em></p><p><em>Written with hilarious verve by Oscar award-winning animator Will Vinton and his longtime writing partner Andrew Wiese.</em></p><p><em>Check out the 3-D \"turnaround\" sneak preview look at a sculptural maquette of <b>Will Vinton's Jack Hightower </b>character. It was sculpted by Gentle Giant Studios for Dark Horse, under the personal supervision of Will Vinton. Will likes to refer to it as the \"life size\" statue of Jack, as the figure measured 10 inches. It is being developed for release as a limited-edition statue, but exact price and schedule are still to be determined.</em></p><p><em>Plus, make sure to visit the official Jack Hightower website <b>www.jackhightower.com</b></em></p>",

Enjoy your favorite characters' awkward, embarrassing first appearances; watch them stumble from their early, crude glory into their mature sadistic and masochistic selves. Li'l Bloody and the Pullapart Boy steal candy, X-Ray Spence answers his fan mail, and Kid Medusa falls in love (twice!). Early critical attention, while overwhelmingly positive, often questioned what Weissman \"was on\" when he came up with these odd tales of young friendship.

            "description": "<p><em>Astronaut Dad is a coming-of-age story about the children of astronauts during the early 1960s right before the Apollo program took off. It's a fictional account of Jimmy Norton and Vanessa Kelly who discover that their dads, as Astronaut reservists, are actually part of a spy orbital program. In book 1, Jimmy and Vanessa uncover the mystery behind a fall-out shelter in the backyard. In book 2, tragedy strikes both families, and the two kids struggle with understanding their fathers. The story marks the transitions we go through with how we perceive our parents -- first as idealized heroes, then as the enemy, and later in life, to see them for who they are.</em></p>",

(also known in the East Coast underground music scene as Kites) is perhaps the most anticipated graphic novel debut of the year. Coming out of the fabled Providence, Rhode Island, art and noise scene, Powr Mastrs is an intense fantasy story projected to run to 10 volumes. In it, C.F. narrates the story of a tribe of mystical warriors whose power relations are constantly in flux. As power shifts, so do physical and psychological identities. In this first volume, we are introduced to the central characters and the complex geographies in which they wander. Overflowing with graphic ideas, from the intricately designed costumes each character wears to C.F.'s exacting architectural detail, Powr Mastrs is rendered in a distinctive pencil line that has already attracted much attention in sources like the groundbreaking comics anthology, Kramers Ergot.</em></p>",

A tiny little island off the East Coast of America, that sits on its own tiny little fault on the underlying tectonic plate. An odd little history ignored by almost everyone. Until the night of the big storm, and the crack in the fault line, and the release of something foul from the earth's guts, blown across the little town on Smoky Island. And the only two people on the island who were outside its reach are now trapped on a black spit of rock with a population who aren't people anymore. They started eating each other an hour ago. This book is available in two horrific editions with all-new covers by Jacen Burrows - softcover or a special hardcover edition limited to just 750 copies.</em></p><h4>Release Dates</h4><ul><li>Softcover - 12/5/2007</li><li>Limited Edition Hardcover - 12/12/2007</li></ul>",

Wormwood is the anti-Christ, his dad is Satan, and his demonic powers help him fit right into New York. His best friend is Jesus, a black mentally-challenged man that just isn't performing many miracles these days. The pesky Armageddon is coming up, and it doesn't look like Pope Jacko is going to be any help in stopping it. Ennis drags the whole world into the gutter with his trademark razor-sharp dialogue, biting wit, and the stunning art of Jacen Burrows, all in full-color.</em></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The hardcover edition was limited to 750 copies.</p>",

Brilliantly interweaving the lives of the creators with the world of their creation, artists Steve Rolston and Philip Bond bring the comic-booking trio Maxwell Roth, Case Weaver, and Denny Jones to life, while the inimitable Jason Shawn Alexander and Eduardo Barreto illustrate the thrilling trials and exciting extrications of the new-and old-Escapist!</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The Blue Beetle debuted in 1939, rivaling such icons as Superman and Batman for longevity in comics, but not in popularity until his recent death and resurrection as a result of DC Comics’ hit Infinite Crisis series. Now, Comic Book Artist magazine’s Christopher Irving explores the history and uncovers the secrets lurking under the cover of the character’s comics in The Blue Beetle Companion! Follow his 60+ years of evolution—from the world of Fox Comics to an in-depth history of Charlton Comics—all the way to the hall of today’s DC Comics. Find out what really happened to infamous Golden Age publisher Victor Fox, and get an in-depth look at the Blue Beetle radio show and Jack “King” Kirby’s Blue Beetle comic strip. Also, presented for the first time since 1939: the first appearance of The Blue Beetle from Mystery Men Comics #1! Featuring interviews with Will Eisner, Joe Simon, Joe Gill, Roy Thomas, Geoff Johns, Cully Hamner, Keith Giffen, Len Wein, and others, plus never-before-seen Blue Beetle designs by Alex Ross and Alan Weiss, as well as artwork by Will Eisner, Charles Nicholas, Steve Ditko, Kevin Maguire, and more! It also features an introduction by Tom DeHaven, the acclaimed author of the novel It’s Superman! and Derby Dugan’s Depression Funnies. Featuring a new cover by current Blue Beetle artist Cully Hamner, this is the ultimate look at one of comicdom’s longest-living heroes!</em></p>",

His style is cartoonish, evoking childhood nostalgia and dereliction of adult responsibility. There are clowns and kitty cats, grinning faces and beaming suns. But Flora did not restrain his darker impulses. His montages are crammed with bullets and knives and fang-baring snakes. Muggers run amok, demons frolic with rouged harlots, and Flora's characters suffer that is, are afflicted by the artist with severe disfigurement. The banal and the violent often coexist within inches of each other on the canvas. </em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>\"I am determined to prove a villain,\" vows the sinister Duke of Gloucester as he prepares to seize the English Crown and become King Richard III. A fusion of the original Shakespeare with manga visuals, this is a cutting-edge adaptation set in a darkly gothic, medieval England. We follow the scheming, seductive Duke as he cheats and slaughters his way to the throne in one of the bloodiest chapters in the monarchy's history. He masterminds the murder of his brother and his two nephews, and poisons his wife in order to marry his own niece. When his throne is challenged, his reign of terror is broken and the ghosts of his victims return to torment him. Richard III is part of Manga Shakespeare, a series of graphic novel adaptations of William Shakespeare's plays. Drawing inspiration from Japan and using Shakespeare's original texts, this series – adapted by Richard Appignanesi and illustrated by leading manga artists – brings to life the great Bard's words for students, Shakespeare enthusiasts and manga fans.</em></p>",
