            "description": "<p>From the files of the Secret Justice Team comes a tale of derring-do and action-packed action, as Captain Yesterday (Fry), Clobberella (Leela), and Super King (Bender) face the vengeful wrath of the spawn of one of the greatest villains from their decidedly small Rogues Gallery, The Sun!</p><p>Zodberg is dressed up in as a superhero and is calling himself, The Claw.  He's trying out for the \"New Justice\" team made up of Captain Yesterday (Fry), Clobberella (Leela) and Super King (Bender).  They tell him he's not good enough.  Trying to show they what he can do, he accidentally cuts off Super King's head.<br/></p><p>It turns out Bender was merely dreaming this.  Fry is trying to wake him up.  He tells Fry that he actually wasn't dreaming but remembering, for some reason, the time they were all superheroes.  He got a new flash card and Fry notices that it says it's a \"flashback memory card.\"  Bender says he needs to pay more attention when he's stealing stuff.  Fry wishes he could remember more.  The miracle cream that gave them their powers had the side-effect of memory loss.  Bender tells him he can project the memory onto the wall and begins replaying the memories.</p><p>Captain Yesterday and Clobberella go outside with the Professor when suddenly night becomes daylight.  A flying flaming man arrives to see them.  Captain Yesterday recognizes him as the Human Sun.  He corrects him and tells him the Human Sun was his father and they're the ones that put him in jail.  He is...the Son of the Sun.<br/></p><p>Son of the Sun begins blazing and heating things up. Hermes runs out and recites the statute that decrees villains are required to give out their secret origins.  Son of the Sun agrees.</p><p>His father, the Human Sun, was a crook but wasn't very successful at it.  Son of the Sun was raised in his care and taught the ways of being a super-villain.  Clobberella asks if he wants to free his father but Son of the Sun says no because they didn't really get along.  But he still wants to have revenge on the world.  He has created five mini-suns that are orbiting the Earth at that moment.</p><p>Things are heating up all over.  Even President Nixon's head is beginning to boil in his jar.  Captain Yesterday says it's time for them to do something.  Super King doesn't feel like it until he hears Captain Yesterday mention being rewarded with endorsements including malt liquor.<br/></p><p>They begin battling Son of the Sun but heat begins making them see things.  Fry seems to be having a sunstroke and is envisioning a world where everyone looks like characters from Ronald McDonald's world.  Son of the Sun decides to leave them all to die.</p><p>The world is heating over and the New Justice team can't do anything about it since they cannot go to Son of the Sun's base on the sun.  The Professor then comes in and tells them about his new invention, the Nimbus 50000, a supercharged portable air conditioner.  It projects a force field within twenty feet of it.<br/></p><p>They journey to the sun and soon enter Son of the Sun's lair.  Soon they are captured and are tied up in a deathtrap.  He is about to leave them in never-ending daylight when Clobberella mentions that it seems like he really hates the dark.  It turns out he is.  His father kept him in constant light and the dark is just creepy to him.  They begin to tell him the positive sides of darkness like romance, theft and a good night's sleep.  Thinking that perhaps he's been wrong about darkness, they soon are at a nightclub.  He thanks them for steering him clear on the awesomeness of the night.</p><p>The memory is over.  Fry and Bender both miss being superheros.  They decide to do it again, but in video game form.  Hermes comes in and yells at them that they should be scrubbing the Planet Express ship.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>THE NEW CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS FOR THE HEART OF HIS COUNTRY IN A CITY GONE INSANE!</em></p><p>Last issue was just the tip of the iceberg, as the Red Skull's master plan kicks into motion, and chaos begins to take hold of the US, with only one man to stand in its way, but is he up to the task? By Harvey and Eisner Award-Winning Best Writer Ed Brubaker with art by master storytellers Steve Epting and Butch Guice!</p><p>Falcon finds an abandoned rehab clinic in Upstate New York. He reports back to Tony Stark that Dr. Faustus was recently there. The birds in the area tell him that several men were there moving things into a truck. Falcon asks Tony if he's going to send a team up to investigate the place but after the shooting from the brainwashed S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, he has his hands full in meetings with several other agencies.</p><p>News coverage of the shooting reveal that S.H.I.E.L.D. has yet to comment on the tragedy. Senator Wright, who is also the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee gives a speech to calm the concerns. He says because their security is under question, they will be using an outside security firm to protect the nation's capital. They will be working until Washington D.C. is safe once again.</p><p>Wright is meeting with Dr. Faustus in his office watching the report. Faustus tells him he will be rewarded for his part. Outside, a big crowd of protesters is demanding accountability. Bucky walks the outskirts of the crowd observing while the Black Widow hacks into their satellites since they are under a partial lockdown. As a young kid tries selling Bucky some bottled water, Natalia discovers that the security firm is owned by a company that's owned by another company and so on until it's clear that they are owned by the Kronos Corporation. They caused the panic and are now protecting the capital. They both know that this all has to be a diversion for something else. Bucky then sees an empty water bottle and notices the company is a division of Kronos International. The crowd has been drugged into starting a riot.</p><p>Elsewhere, Aleksander looks on as a hologram of the new CEO of Kronos works on a deal with the Secretary of the United States. Lukin begins \"talking\" to the Red Skull saying that he's completely changed his original plan. He wanted to cripple the United States, not work deals with them. The Skull tells him that they want the same things.</p><p>The crowd outside the capital suddenly turns into a riot. Bucky is surprised at how quickly it starts and figures that there's no way everyone could have been drugged. He doesn't want to let anyone else die but isn't quite sure how he can help them. He figures Steve would've known what to do. He ducks into an alley and changes into Captain America. He stops several security officers from beating on the crowd and uses sleeping gas to try to calm things down. He looks around trying to figure out what the Red Skull's plan really is. As he throws the shield around to prevent civilians getting shot, he notes that he's getting pretty good at using it. Black Widow is finally able to sort through the images from the satellite and sees that a helicopter landed on the roof of the Senate building. He makes his way there and crashes through a window. He finds Sin and the Serpent Squad there and figures he can easily handle them.</p><p>When Dr. Faustus arrives at the Skull's place, they begin talking about Sharon Carter. Faustus says he was about to go check on her but the Skull says she requires more attention than he's been giving her. Sharon wakes up and finds herself in a hospital gown, strapped to a bed. Arnim Zola approaches here and tells her not to worry since he's a doctor too. She ask herself, how long did she think she could hide her pregnancy from them.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Sinestro and Hal have been summoned back to Oa. The Guardians of the Universe want them to answer for supposedly breaking the territorial edict. Therefore, their rings autopilot them back to Oa to face the Guardians.<br /><br />The Guardians are upset at Sinestro for breaking this edict a second time. Sinestro claims that he was assisting a rookie in the apprehension of Atroticus of the Five Inversions. The Guardians do not take this to heart and state that this isn't an excuse to break the edict. The Guardians want Atroticus to be returned to Ysmault where he will finish out the remainder of his sentence, an eternity of imprisonment.<br /><br />Hal begins to speak his mind and question the rules set forth by the Guardians. He questions why the Green Lantern Corps members must be separated, why the Manhunters went rogue, and if the Guardians even felt fear. This last question enrages the Guardians and Sinestro abruptly puts an end to Hals questioning. He's afraid that he may have pushed them a little too far.<br /><br />The Guardians tell Hal that he was out of line to mention that and threaten him to the verge of expulsion.<br /><br />Sinestro retorts the Guardians and claims that in some circumstances it is necessary for fellow Corps members to travel to other sectors of the galaxy to assist them, help them grow, and to make sure that they are \"in check\". All of these things can ensure that the Massacre of Sector 666 does not ever happen again.<br /><br />The Guardians leave Hal with his ring and in the care of Sinestro as they contemplate their decision. Sinestro then begins to gather his things in preparation for transporting Atroticus to Ysmault. Sinestro tells Hal that they will reconvene in another month so he can \"evaluate Hals' progress\".<br /><br />Back in Ferris airfield, Tom and Hal are discussing which aircraft Hal is going to be taking up that day. Tom, in a matter of three weeks, has repaired the old plane which was off to the junk yard. This aircraft is special to Hal because it is one that his father had taken him up in as a child.<br /><br />At Edwards Air Force base, Hector Hammond is contained inside a small chamber in Hangar 44. He wants out and doesn't appreciate being \"poked and prodded\" by their scientists. Hector is jealous of Hal and Green Lantern's lifestyle.<br /><br />In Coast City Hospital, William Hand is seen browsing bodies in the morgue by the security guard. William kills the guard with his Cosmic Divining Rod.<br /><br />Sinestro, finally delivers Atrocticus to Ysmault. As he's about to leave the Five Inversions begin to taunt him about witnessing Abin Sur's death. They also state a prophesy that Sinestro's homeworld will decend into civil unrest with riots, and a 'bloody coup'. Krougar will lead the unrest. Sinestro states his doubt and that they cannot instill fear in him. Atrocticus threatens that one day Sinestro will feel his rage and will burn with it.</p>",
