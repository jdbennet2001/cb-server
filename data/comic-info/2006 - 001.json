And the only two people on the island who were outside its reach are now trapped on a black spit of rock with a population who aren't people anymore.

            "description": "<p><i>After the INFINITE CRISIS and before One Year Later, the DCU spent a year without Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. A year in which those heroes were needed more than ever as the fate of the world hung in the balance. Who stood up in their absence? And who sat out? The story of DC's most eventful year ever can now be told as four of the hottest writers in comics - Grant Morrison, Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, Mark Waid - deliver an unprecedented weekly tale of death, danger, romance, intergalactic terror and the never-ending, universal meaning of heroism. Joined by storyteller Keith Giffen and cover artist J.G. Jones, 52 features art for the first month by Joe Bennett, Ruy Jose, and Jack Jadson. Also, starting in Week #2: 'The History of the DC Universe,' a 10-part backup feature by Dan Jurgens and Art Thibert that takes you on a tour through the legendary past of the DCU. 52: A year without Superman; a year without Batman; a year without Wonder Woman...but not a year without heroes.</i></p><p>Week 1, Day 1-4</p><p>Ralph Dibney sits in his completely destroyed house and takes stock of his losses as he talks about the upcoming funeral of his wife Sue. Renee Montoya sits in a bar and gets drunk. Steel searches the debris in Paris looking for survivors.</p><p>Week 1, Day 5</p><p>Booster Gold, in his sponsor-filled uniform, uses Skeets' knowledge of the present to capture and defeat an unsuspecting Mammoth. Afterwards he takes time for some photo ops with some kids who are worried that Wonder Woman is dead. He tells them that he has seen the future and knows there is nothing to worry about. Then he puts one foot on Mammoth and shills Soder Cola because “sometimes even superheroes get thirsty.” Skeets tells him to hold the smile back because the public is still saddened by the recent loss of Superboy. So, Booster plays it up and even sheds a tear but he is in too good of a mood to really dwell on it. He knows that tomorrow he is going to be asked to be part of the Justice League roster.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ralph sits on a bed at the Ambassador Hotel chewing mints. He listens to his cell phone messages and, contemplating suicide, he places a nickel-plated .45 caliber hand gun in his mouth. As a tear rolls down his face, a message from the cemetery reports that someone left a message on his wife's tombstone.</p><p>In Paris, Steel confronts his niece, Natasha Irons, because she is going to meet the Teen Titans instead of helping Steel with the relief work in Paris. Unbeknownst to her, Steel had set up her armor to explode by remote control. He quickly dismantles her armor, tersely informing her that she hasn't earned her armor or her role as a hero yet; if she wants her armor back, she can rebuild it herself.</p><p>In the land of Kahndaq, Black Adam tells his people that they have a new mission but is interrupted by a suicide bomber. Adam grabs him and rips off one of his arms, telling the failed suicidal assassin that he has three more chances to tell him who planned the attempt.</p><p>Week 1, Day 6</p><p>Doctor Sivana is watching TV when interrupted by some yet-unidentified creatures.</p><p>Back in Metropolis, the rest of the surviving superheroes are getting acquainted and figuring out the death toll. Booster Gold is excited because this is the moment he believes he will be asked to join the Justice League. Unfortunately, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman don't show. Booster starts to panic, constantly checking with Skeets for historical information. Skeets soon shuts down and falls to the ground. Booster becomes crazed and starts yelling at Jimmy Olsen to take the photo of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. Other people and superheroes try to grab him and restrain him. Booster ends up elbowing Clark Kent in the nose, as he says “Booster, they're not coming.” Booster asks him how he knows, and Clark just says, “I just know, and I'm sorry.”</p><p>Week 1, Day 7</p><p>Gotham City. The Question removes the bat from the bat signal and spray paints a question mark on it. He turns on the searchlight, aiming it at a drunk Renee Montoya's apartment window. Montoya's is furious, not really comprehending that the backwards question mark is not the typical bat signal. Als she can howl out in a drunen rage is that the signal should be aimed at the sky.Notes</p><p>\"Tomorrow is the defining moment of the century and I'm gonna be part of it.\"</p><p>-- Booster Gold</p><p>NOTE:</p><p>The splash page on story pages 18-19 has two, as-of-yet unidentified characters.</p><ol><li><p>She is standing to the left of Shift, wearing a purple and red outfit with yellow gloves/boots.</p></li><li><p>He is seen talking with Ray and Manhattan Guardian.

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>The Illuminati is a secret organization comprised of several of the world's most powerful heroes: Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, King of the Inhumans, Charles Xavier, founder of the X-Men and mutant rights activist, Reed Richards,founding member of the Fantastic Four, Namor the Sub-Mariner, King of Atlantis and Iron Man (Anthony Stark), founding member of the Avengers.</p><p>These six men have worked together to mold and shape the status of the superhuman world and the world around it.</p><p>How and what they have done together has remained a mystery...</p><p>UNTIL NOW...</p><p>Writers Brian Michael Bendis ( Avengers, Ultimate Spider-Man) and Brian Reed ( Ms. Marvel) have joined together with Jim Cheung (Young Avengers) to reveal this untold story of the Marvel Universe and the Illuminati's actions affect today!</p><p>Years back during the Kree/Skrull war, the Illuminati proactively try to keep the war from spilling over towards the Earth.</p><p><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></p><p>Years ago...</p><p>[On a Capital Skrull Ship over Throneworld]</p><p>Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII is hearing from one of his advisors that the Kree-Skrull War is over on account of Rick Jones, a \"single human\". Outraged, Dorrek demands an explanation as to how their superior fleet had been defeated. The advisor cautiously lays down the factors: explaining that the Earth's population of \"genetic atrocities\" (mutants) and so-called superheroes posed the biggest threat, and in conjunction with the competition from the Kree, the Skrulls' attempt to conquer Earth with a frontal attack was impossible.</p><p>The two are interrupted by the teleportation of the Illuminati, who introduce themselves as Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, Iron Man of the Avengers, Prince Namor of Atlantis, Doctor Stephen Strange of the mystic arts, Professor Charles Xavier of the \"genetic atrocities\", and Black Bolt of the Inhumans. Mr. Fantastic quickly declares that they traveled there to inform the Emperor that they will not tolerate another invasion of Earth and warns him against even approaching Earth space. Iron Man and Namor promise the Emperor retribution should he disregard their warnings. Dorrek is offended by their presence and swears that the Earth planet belongs to the Skrulls while promising to wipe out the human race, starting with their families. In acknowledgement, Iron Man asks Black Bolt what he has to say...</p><p>The Capital Skrull Ship explodes from the inside out, and the Illuminati are safely teleported aboard the nearby Quinjet by Doctor Strange. Namor rejoices at the ship's destruction, watching with pride from a window as it crashes down into the water below. When the rest of the Illuminati do not share his satisfaction, Namor comments that he'll just enjoy it enough for everyone then. Just then, the Quinjet is fired upon by multiple Skrull ships, despite being cloaked. The assault comes too fast for Doctor Strange or Professor X to aid in their escape, and the Quinjet is blown to pieces. The Illuminati drift in space, helpless.</p><p>Skrull scientists look upon their captured subjects. Mr. Fantastic is stretched in captivity to an enormous length and width, and the scientists are curious as to what the upper limits of his extension are. Namor is laid within a heated cell, deprived of nearly all moisture in the air as the scientists mock his existence as a \"homo superior\". Black Bolt is held in restraints with a beam immobilizing his vocal chords as the scientists comment on the perverse nature of the \"Kree-spawn\" and the Terrigen Mists. Professor X is held suspended in a containment field while the scientists explore his mutant DNA. Doctor Strange is held upside-down inside a spinning containment field while the scientists are confounded by his mystical powers and have called in priests from the Vovco Islands to look into them. The scientists then move onto study Iron Man's armor, which lies in pieces on a lab table. They comment on its primitive design in comparison to Skrull technology and state that it will go into the Royal Trophy Room, now that it has been dismantled. After discovering the armor kept Tony Stark's heart valves working, they are anxious to see how long he will survive without it.</p><p>Tony Stark sits naked alone in the brig. He is greeted by the Avengers, who crash through to rescue him. Stark knows better however, and tells the Skrull imposters that they always underestimate their opponents, asking them how dumb they think he is. The Skrull Quicksilver and Skrull Scarlet Witch insist that the exercise was a waste of time, but the Skrull Captain America and Skrull Thor think otherwise. The Skrull Thor theorizes that Stark doesn't expect his teammates to come and rescue him because no one knows they came there. He assaults Stark, who quickly incapacitates the Skrulls in unarmed combat, noting the training the real Captain America had given him beforehand. He puts on some pants taken from a Skrull and moves on with a Skrull rifle, freeing Charles Xavier from his confinement. Once free, Xavier assaults the Skrull scientists around him psychically until they are begging him to stop. Tony asks him if he's happened to have seen his armor, and Xavier replies that he hasn't while expressing concern for Tony's heart. Stark helps him move down the corridor to rescue the others. Namor exclaims that he would very much like to hit something, and Xavier alerts the two that the entire Skrull armada has been called. They quickly free Doctor Strange, who casts a spell to keep Stark's heart pumping for a little while longer. After recovering Black Bolt, the Illuminati arrive where Reed Richards is being painfully stretched. Namor recovers Richards and they make it into a large Skrull ship for their escape. Tony Stark pilots the Skrull ship out of the hangar, shooting into the atmosphere. As a countless number of Skrull attack ships open fire on their vessel, Black Bolt motions for them to open the back pod-bay. Doctor Strange refuses, stating that they are almost out of the atmosphere. Reed asks Strange if he can cast an illusion spell to aid in their escape, and Xavier helps \"sell\" it psychically.</p><p>As the Skrull armada bears down on the Illuminati's ship, a gigantic psychic illusion of Galactus appears before them. Many Skrulls, in their panic, collide into each other as the Illuminati flies off to safety. As they pass quietly by Saturn, Namor exclaims that they will come for them. Xavier tells him that the Skrulls were coming for them already. Stark replies that Namor is right, but at the very least, they made it clear that if they DO come at Earth, then the fight will be a real fight. Maybe now they'll look for someone else to pick on. The Illuminati pause, and as their ship nears Earth, Tony says \"well, at least now they know it'll be a GOOD fight.\"</p><p>Back on Throneworld, Emperor Dorrek sits in his broken throne among the ruins of his chambers. He asks his advisor if they got what they needed from the [Illuminati], and the advisor answers \"yes.\" The Emperor sullenly declares that it was worth it. He orders that the priests of the sciences get to work, exclaiming that no matter how long it takes, he will wait.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>From one of America's most acclaimed comics writers — a startlingly original look at life on the streets of Baghdad during the Iraq War inspired by true events.\tIn his award-winning work on Y: THE LAST MAN and EX MACHINA (one of Entertainment Weekly's 2005 Ten Best Fiction titles), writer Brian K. Vaughan has displayed an understanding of both the cost of survival and the political nuances of the modern world. Now, in this provocative graphic novel, Vaughan examines life on the streets of war-torn Iraq. The experience is made all the more evocative by the lush, spectacular artwork of Niko Henrichon. In the spring of 2003, a pride of lions escaped from the Baghdad Zoo during an American bombing raid. Lost and confused, hungry but finally free, the four lions roamed the decimated streets of Baghdad in a desperate struggle for their lives. In documenting the plight of the lions, PRIDE OF BAGHDAD raises questions about the true meaning of liberation — can it be given, or is it earned only through self-determination and sacrifice? And in the end, is it truly better to die free than to live life in captivity?Based on a true story, Vaughan and Henrichon have created a unique and heartbreaking window into the nature of life during wartime, illuminating this struggle as only the graphic novel can.</i></p><p>A pride of lions kept at the Baghdad Zoo must fend for themselves after they are abandoned when the war in Iraq causes the city to be bombed and looted.</p>",

In their way stand an embattled crew of seven hardy Autobot warriors, sworn to prevent the impending Armageddon at any cost, and an unlikely trio of human misfits, pulled kicking and screaming into a hitherto hidden world of pain and hurt. The can of worms is open, the genie the out of bottle… and nothing will ever be the same again! It begins again–here, now–the saga of the war-torn robots in disguise, the Transformers! Legendary Transformers writer Simon Furman and artist EJ Su pick up where they left off in “The Transformers: Prelude to Infiltration” with the first official issue of The Transformers: Infiltration.</i></p>",

The Nuclear Option to be sent in when absolutely, positively, need to kill everything in sight. Now, Ares -- who has invaded Olympus, attempted to take over earth, stood at the walls of Troy, and fought toe to toe with and against Earth’s greatest heroes – has turned his back on Olympus and centuries of brutal warfare to begin life anew on Earth with one goal: to raise his child. But what happens when Olympus – under siege and in danger of falling – calls on its most violent son to come to its rescue? And what happens if Ares refuses?

            "description": "<p>It starts out with Hot Rod riding on a meteor which is heading towards a moon. He thinks about how people always tell him things are impossible and he always believes there’s a way to do anything. He eventually jumps off of the meteor and crashes onto the moon by himself and although he survives, he is badly damaged by the fall. Hot Rod then flashes back to a time on Ki-Aleta when he was first put in charge of a unit. They reach a place called the Omega bunker and devise a plan to distract the omega guardians, sneak into the bunker, and secure the magnificence – a map of everything in the universe. He then flashes back to his present situation where he is trying to break into Styx – the most brutal Decepticon penal colony. He uses a virus to create false alarms around the base, sending guards everywhere at certain times, allowing Hot Rod to get by undetected. As he tries to get to the Z-Lateral cell block, more memories of Ki-Aleta come up. They manage to distract the guardians and Hot Rod and Download are working to secure the magnificence but as they do, something goes wrong with the holograms distracting the guardians and they are detected and Download is killed by them. Back in the present, Hot Rod disguises himself with a hologram and gets to the Z-Lateral block and all the cell doors are opened by his virus. He tries not to think about anyone else he could rescue and focuses on saving one bot in particular – Dealer – who he abandoned back on Ki-Aleta. He remembers how back on Ki-Aleta, Dealer was under attack by Decepticons and was calling for help but Hot Rod had to ignore him to carry out the back-up plan made to secure the magnificence in case the main plan failed. Hot Rod finds Dealer alive but damaged in his cell and places a hologram on him to disguise him as well. Hot Rod then commandeers a ship and they use it to escape. When Dealer is fixed up, Hot Rod tries to apologize to Dealer but Dealer says it’s no problem and he understands why he did what he did. However, Dealer is later seen talking to Banzaitron about how he compromised the mission from the beginning and that Hot Rod is still unaware of that. Banzaitron is annoyed that they didn’t get what they wanted because Hot Rod still secured the magnificence but Dealer tells him that Hot Rod still feels guilty and feels as though he owes Dealer and that they can use that to get what they want. Banzaitron then decides to rename Dealer to Doubledealer.</p>",

When a doomsday weapon manufactured by Hydra turns up in the  Nevada desert, there's only one man the authorities can ask to go in  and defuse it: Bruce Banner! What does all of this have to do with the  FF, you ask? Well, who do you think has to deal with the fallout when it  all goes terribly wrong? Then, in the wake of recent events, Bruce  Banner has finally found a semblance of peace. Here, in the isolated  interior of Alaska, he hopes to protect the rest of humanity from the  Hulk's never-ending rampage by secluding himself in self-imposed exile.  Banner is confident that his plan will work - after all, who would be  foolish enough to actually come looking for the Hulk? But when Nick Fury  comes calling, you know there's trouble for someone involved. It all  ends with the Hulk being shot into space by those he once called allies!  Collecting FANTASTIC FOUR #533-535 and INCREDIBLE HULK #88-91.</i>",

For the past few years, Matt Murdock’s life has been teetering on the edge of destruction. Now, pushed beyond the limit, Matt finds himself behind the eight ball with no clear way out, the people he calls friends slowly deserting him, and Hell’s Kitchen gradually slipping out of control. The question is, when his back is against the wall, just how far will Daredevil go to get back what is his? Spinning out of the stunning finale of Bendis and Maleev’s ground-breaking run, Brubaker and Lark pick up the billy club and run as hard and as fast as they can to leave their own mark on one of comics’ most enduring legends. Longtime DD fans will not be disappointed! Collects DAREDEVIL #82-87.</i></p>",

THE TYGER: Long before he waged a one-man vendetta against organized crime, long before he was young lieutenant waging war in the jungles of 'Nam, Frank Castle was a 10-year-old boy growing up on the mean streets of Brooklyn. When a classmate commits suicide in the aftermath of an unspeakable act, young Frank uncovers a secret dark enough to blacken the purest of hearts. Thus begins his first journey on the road that will eventually turn him into the man known as the Punisher, a journey that will bring him face to face with the Tyger: a creature not made by God, but just as vital to the world as anything He created. THE CELL: From the darkest bowels of Riker's prison, the old men preside over their empire. Nothing goes down without their say-so; no one draws a breath without their permission. And when a riot explodes, they need only fortify their defenses and ride it out. But someone else is weaving his way through the bloodstained halls, their newest neighbor: Frank Castle. THE END: Legendary artist Richard Corben joins definitive Punisher writer Garth Ennis for Frank Castle's last stand! In a world gone mad, the Punisher just might be the sanest man on Earth. Now he's heading home, to the place it all began, and heaven help anyone who stands in his path.</em></p><p>In the first part of this volume, a young Frank Castle becomes involved in a tale of murder and revenge in his mob-controlled neighborhood.</p>",

Earthlight is a very expensive and controversial project, and life there is tense and difficult. Safety regulations must be obeyed to the letter.

Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, and James Joyce walk into a Parisian bar... no, it's not the beginning of a joke, but the premise of Jason's unique new graphic novel. Set in 1920s Paris, <b>The Left Bank Gang</b> is a deliciously inventive re-imagining of these four literary figures as not only typical Jason anthropomorphics, but...graphic novelists! Yes, in Jason's warped world, cartooning is the dominant form of fiction, and not only do these four work literary giants work in the comics medium but they get together to discuss pen vs. brush, chat about the latest graphic novels from Dostoevsky (\"I can't tell any of his characters apart!\") to Faulkner (\"Hasn't he heard of white space? His panels are too crowded!\"), and bemoan their erratic careers. With guest appearances by Zelda Fitzgerald and Jean-Paul Sartre, and a few remarkable twists and turns along the way, and you've got one of the funniest and most playful graphic novels of the year. Like Jason's acclaimed <b>Why Are You Doing This?</b>, <b>The Left Bank Gang</b> is rendered in full spectacular color.</i></p>",

But the day his feline \"brother\" died was the day Ameya withdrew from the world. Several years later, Ameya encounters a drenched stray cat in the park. Little does he know what fate has in store for him...</em></p><p>Have you ever loved a pet so much that they became human to you? As a child, Ameya saw his cat as someone more than pet: a brother. As the years went by, their bond grew ever tighter. But the day his \"brother\" died was the day Ameya withdrew from the world. Now, several years later, a park in the pouring rain after an argument with his agent was the last place the once-prolific artist Ameya thought he'd find himself. Little did he know what fate, in the form of a drenched stray cat that resembled his beloved \"brother,\" had in store for him. What follows after Loki's arrival, along with support and encouragement by Miss Chacha, is a series of often-colorful events. From vet visits, sunbeam snoozing/day­dreaming, fishing, and dust bunny and bird chasing, to falling in love, first dates, car trips and the grand finale of an Art Gala, Ameya and Loki's growing bond is continually tested and strengthened. What complicates matters is that Ameya begins to personify Loki and see him as a human, not a cat. This does help jumpstart his art again, but it also causes a fair amount of chaos and the occasional questioning of Ameya's mental stability. However, it is through this somewhat unorthodox relationship that Ameya regains the love and inspiration he thought he'd lost. The bond between owner and pet is an interesting and complicated one, and it will be explored fully as Ameya begins to leave his self-imposed isolation and Loki learns to trust and love again.</p>",

The Nuclear Option to be sent in when you absolutely, positively need to kill everything in sight. Now, Ares - who has invaded Olympus, attempted to take over earth, stood at the walls of Troy and fought toe to toe with and against Earth's greatest heroes - has turned his back on Olympus and centuries of brutal warfare to begin life anew on Earth with one goal: to raise his child. But what happens when Olympus, under siege and in danger of falling, calls on its most violent son to come to its rescue? And what happens if Ares refuses? Will Zeus destroy his son - and his grandson - to save his city? This story brings together heroes new and old, uniting Hercules and the Greek Pantheon with the Marvel Universe. Ares is the God of War, so we promise this is like no heroic book Marvel has done before. Heads will fly and blood will flow between Ares and anyone who stands in the way of his son.

Perpetual geek, social basket case and obsessive fan – needless to say, the guy called \"Train Man\" has never had a girlfriend. Most of his days are spent immersed in electronics and waiting for the box set DVD of his favorite anime series.</i></p><p><i>But fate takes a turn for Train one ordinary night on an ordinary train ride. He falls in love at first sight with Hermess, a gorgeous fellow passenger. When a drunken rider tries to harass her, Train surprises himself by coming to her rescue. But when Hermess later contacts Train with a thank you give and the possibility of further contact, that's one situation he can't handle.</i></p><p><i>He immediately goes online to a popular chat room to solicit advice. To his horror, he's encouraged to ask her out. Soon he is bombarded with advice regarding how, when and where he should do it. Will Train Man find true love, or will all this pressure to come out of his shell be too much for him to take?</i></p><p><i>Based on a supposedly true story, the tale of DENSHA OTOKO (<b>The Train Man</b>) was a phenomenon in Japan.</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Prologue: Even Without Courage...</li><li>Mission 1: I...

They are actually  encounters with the </i><i>dead-their way of sending us a message. But  you may not want to open such strange mail from beyond-not unless you  can see the ghostly attachment, like Akiba can. And not unless you carry  a gun that can kill what isn't alive, like Akiba's aptly named </i><i>Kagutsuchi,</i><i> \"the tool between God and earth\"... digging a divine grave to lay to rest the evil dead.<br /><br /> Volume 1 of </i> <i>Mail opens  with a model's photo shoot at what was a lovely riverside. But  someone's thrown their trash away here: human bones. When the negatives  in the darkroom reveal hidden horror, it's time for the magazine to hire  Akiba. The answers lie in the secret basement of a shunned house...  but they don't lie peacefully!</i>",

Sharing the same goofy, over-the-top comic mayhem that was Chaplin's trademark, and preceding the expressive, cartoony art style of <b>MAD Magazine</b> legend Harvey Kurtzman, all of <b>He Done Her Wrong</b>'s hilarious slapstick, tragic heartbreak, heroism and villainy, character development, high emotions and raucous thrills somehow manages to take place, astonishingly, without a single word of text, or conversation, or even a footnote. The story follows the convoluted misadventures of a naïve frontiersman with superhuman strength exploited by a larcenous robber baron who eventually double crosses our hero and steals his girl. <b>He Done Her Wrong</b> is a classic comics work, legendary among aficionados, and arguably the 20th century's first graphic novel. Fantagraphics Books is proud to put this back into print in a facsimile edition, unabridged, with newly designed covers.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><em><strong>The Three Paradoxes</strong> is an intricate and complex autobiographical comic by one of the most talented and innovative young cartoonists today. The story begins with a story inside the story: the cartoon character Paul Hornschemeier is trying to finish a story called \"Paul and the Magic Pencil.\" Paul has been granted a magical implement, a pencil, and is trying to figure out what exactly it can do. He isn't coming up with much, but then we zoom out of this story to the creator, Paul, whose father is about to go on a walk to turn off the lights in his law office in the center of the small town. Abandoning the comic strip temporarily, Paul leaves with his camera, in order to fulfill a promise to his girlfriend that he would take pictures of the places that affected him as a child. Each \"chapter\" of the story is drawn in a completely different style, with strikingly unique production and color themes, and yet, somehow, despite (or perhaps because of) this non-linear progression, it all comes together as one story: a story questioning change, progress, and worth within the author's life.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em> Firecrackers lighting up an ancient tree on a summer evening. Twin boys born the same night their grandmother passes away. Teenagers hanging by their fingertips from the roof of a parking garage. These are the moments of quiet poetry that make up Leland Myrick's Missouri Boy. </em></p><p><em>Happiness alternates with tragedy in these snapshots of Myrick's own Missouri childhood. Filled with startling and at times achingly beautiful images - from a perfect paper airplane flying in the autumn sky to visits to the 'underwear pond' to a solitary cross-country motorcycle trip - Myrick has created a graphic poem that brings together the experiences that formed his character, for better and for worse. These moving and intimate vignettes are at once melancholy and hopeful, exploring the surprising links between life and death, beginnings and endings. Poignant, timeless and tenderly evoked, Missouri Boy is a unique tribute to a small-town American childhood.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The book ranges playfully from riffs on the gag cartoon to paranoid soliloquies of a surrealistic apocalypse, with references to contemporary politics, pop culture, and religion, plays on language, and sequential abstractions. Stories intertwine, branch off, dead end and double back. These are experimental, absurdist art comics, but the book is a page-turner, and some of it is laugh-out-loud funny. Reading it is not so much like reading comics as it is watching the artist make connections between ideas, find patterns, and set down the story as it happens. It's a tour de force, beautifully and uniquely packaged, in black and white and color, by one of the most fascinating new cartoonists of the decade.</em></p>",

Early on, she sees things like an imposter shaman being thrashed by a dragon of the deep, and doesn't understand that none of her schoolmates can see such things. Her powers make her the amorous target of hedonistic demons even as a child. Long shielded from the reality of her power, she finally learns the secret of her mother's death, and why her grandmother was never able to leave their village. Enter Sunbi's world in this mind-boggling psychological chiller!</em></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Prologue: The Unfamiliar Family</li><li>Chapter 1: The Ritual of the Dragon Spirit</li><li>Chapter 2: The Dokebi Food</li><li>Chapter 3: The Departure</li></ul>",

The two girls meet and discover that they have identical faces. </em><em>As Yooi accepts the irresistible offer of becoming Lida's look-alike, she finds herself in over her head, being chased by assassins and falling head over heels for Lida's fiancé. </em><em>A revelation of social boundaries and emotional limitlessness, this story will have your heart beating faster with every turn of the page.</em></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 1: Doppelganger</li><li>Chapter 2: Gil, Gaon</li><li>Chapter 3: The Double</li><li>Chapter 4: A Crisis</li><li>Chapter 5: Immersion</li><li>Chapter 6: A Bait</li></ul>",

Before he was one of the undead, he was one of the living and now, the secrets of ESCAPE OF THE LIVING DEAD's breakout zombie star are revealed! Deadhead, the enigmatic, Stars and Stripes_x001E_wearing leader of the army of the walking dead is not like his rotting brethren. Something burns within him, something beyond the hunger for human flesh, something that the zombie multitude recognizes as a power that even they should fear. In the continuation of creator John Russo's saga of The Living Dead, the murder of the man that is Deadhead will be exposed as we witness the horrific events that now drive him in his inexhaustible pursuit of one thing... Make that two things: Human entrails and vengeance!</em></p>",

To play in the puddles after the rain has gone? To return a shell to the sea? The Walking Man follows a modern day Japanese business man as he strolls at random through urban Japan - often silent, usually alone - with his vivid dreams that let time stand still. Every corporate American should have a copy on their desk and, in times of stress, take two chapters, twice a day. Take a little stress out of your life and relax with The Walking Man, a little step every day. Lovingly reversed in collaboration with the creator to read left to right.</em></p>",

He forms relationships with his inanimate surroundings and muses to a dead audience, specifically his bear rug, Philippe. His own tales eventually become entangled with that of the legendary Paul Bunyan, and the two become indirectly intertwined, illuminating the discrepancy between the character of the storyteller and the character within his stories. The lives of both Paul and Pete encounter such things as the questionable origin of an ocean and the desire for preservation of everything from a fallen bird to an overused expression that has strayed a stone's throw from its original meaning.</em></p>",

Elder coined the term \"chicken fat\" to describe the myriad background gags crammed into his stories for MAD, Panic, Humbug, Goodman Beaver and Little Annie Fanny: \"It's the part of the chicken soup that is bad for you, yet gives the soup its delicious flavor,\" he once explained. Chicken Fat is a collection of flavors by a master comedic chef as he works out his recipes. This is a collection of sketches, drawings and a variety of obscure commercial illustration over the course of Elder's long career.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Was treibt den surf begeisterten Wayne immer wieder an jenen einsamen Strand an Mexikos Küste, der nicht gerade für seine Killerwellen bekannt ist? Irgendetwas zieht ihn magisch an, etwas, das möglicherweise der Schlüssel ist zum Rätsel seiner eigenen Herkunft. Ein Rätsel, das zurückreicht bis in die Zeit lange vor der Eroberung Mexikos durch die spanischen Konquistadoren. In eine wilde und mystische Zeit, als Menschen und Götter noch auf Tuchfühlung waren. Hier geschah es, dass die junge Cañari ihren kleinen Bruder Xaotil am Abend vor dem Tag Ix verlor, dem Tag, an dem die Menschen ihren Göttern begegnen. Cañaris Suche nach ihrem Bruder führt sie tief in den Dschungel auf eine fantastische und gefährliche Reise, die alles in den Schatten stellt, was das junge Mädchen sich vorzustellen wagte.</em></p>",
