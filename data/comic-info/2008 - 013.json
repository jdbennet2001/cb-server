            "description": "<p><em>\"Thy Kingdom Come\" continues! The Justice Society has been tracking the \"Heartbreak Slayer\" — a mysterious serial killer targeting super-villains — for months. Now, as new members are welcomed into the fold and the Society expands, the JSA will come face-to-face with an evil that threatens the future they stand for.</em></p><p>At the JSA's headquarters, Stargirl shows Jakeem around as he looks for a room of his own. Each room that he asks about is already being used by one of the newer members. He starts getting angry and asks why she didn't save him a room. She tells him that she didn't know there's be so many new members. He's had it. He kicks open a door saying that whoever is in there is \"steppin' on ouuut.\" Speechless, he finds the room belongs to Thunder, the Black Lightning's youngest daughter. Her parents are there too helping her unpack. They are also packing up some things like the television. Jennifer begins to protest saying that her social life has been demolished since she can't check her e-mail or get phone calls. She wants the television in case Stargirl or Cyclone wanted to watch tv in her room. He mom convinces him to let the tv stay. He reminds her that Mr. Terrific has lots of delicate equipment and if she touches the television, everything within a hundred yards will short out. He tells her to keep her hands off. He also says the same to Jakeem, who looks like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>Dr. Mid-Nite checks out Mr. America after the beating he took. Mr. Terrific goes over the list of those that have been killed recently. They were all superhuman criminals that posed as Gods. As Mr. America made his escape, he heard the name \"Gog\" and asks if it means anything to them. Hourman mentions that he and Liberty Belle found it carved into a pillar. The Superman from the future comes in with Power Girl and tells them it means a lot. Mr. Terrific pulls up a hologram of Gog. Power Girl asks Kal if she recognizes him but he says no. He notes the armor is similar to someone from his time named \"Magog.\" Dr. Mid-Nite tells them that Gog and Magog are mentioned in several different religions. Superman tells them that Magog claimed his powers were given to him by a being named Gog. He claimed to be the last god of the \"Third World.\" Mr. Terrific tells him that the Gog on their world isn't a God at all. His real name is William Matthews and he was born in Chicago. He was a missionary that disappeared in Africa. He returned wearing the armor and attacked Superman just over a year ago. Not knowing why, Kal says he'll go ask Superman.</p><p>Kal flies to Metropolis and hovers outside the Daily Planet. He reminisces as he watches an exchange between Perry and Jimmy. He starts flying closer until he sees Lois and stops in his tracks. At a nearby desk, Clark Kent is admiring his wife when he becomes aware of the other Superman. Kal thought he'd be able to handle seeing Lois again but is taken back. The last time he was at the Daily Planet, he was too late to save all his friends, including Lois.</p><p>As he momentarily grieves, Superman flies over him and asks if he's spying on his wife. Kal tells Superman that he didn't mean any disrespect, he's just trying to adjust to everything. Superman asks if he can help with anything. Kal asks him about Gog. Superman says there isn't much to say. He claimed to be from the future and was the only survivor of a nuclear explosion in Kansas that he failed to prevent. It was Batman that discovered his real name was William Matthews. They figured that he really wasn't from the future, just sick in the head. Kal tells him that maybe he was able to see a glimpse into the future. Kal tells Superman that in his world, Kansas was destroyed. His wife, Lois, was killed by the Joker. He arrested the Joker and right before his trial, a man calling himself Magog killed him. People looked up to Magog after that.</p><p>They are interrupted when Kal hears a voice say that they are a God. Superman doesn't seem to hear it but Kal flies off saying it's coming from Gotham. Hercules finds himself face to face with Gog. Hercules is blasted and sent flying outside. Both Supermen arrive to see him. When Hercules comes to, he slams his elbow in Superman's face, which gives him a bloody nose. He then punches him and sends Superman flying. Kal stands his ground as Hercules prepares to punch him too. The punch doesn't faze or even move Kal in the slightest bit. Hercules tries again but Kal simply grabs his fist with one hand, removes his golden tunic and sends him flying with a punch. Superman moves in to catch him and drives him into a nearby statue. They see that Gog is still inside and move in a streak to get him. As they enter, Gog teleports away. Kal looks at the spot where Gog was and notices traces of volcanic ash. He figures the Justice Society will be able to track where it originated from.</p><p>In the Congo, Gog walks down some old stairs carved into a mountain saying he will get rid of all the Gods that walk the world since they will not save it. He will make the way clear for the only savior that can. He kneels before an enormous head that is either carved or trapped in the side of a mountain.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>After dealing with the attack of 50-foot murderous toys, Superman works to keep Jimmy Olsen out of harm's way. But Jimmy's nose for trouble leads him straight to a reclusive toymaker named Winslow Schott.</em></p><p>Superman is fighting giant toys in Metropolis, including a toy soldier, doll and teddy bear. Because this is happening right outside the Daily Planet, Lois and Jimmy are out checking the scene. Jimmy is trying to get the best pictures he can and not worrying about the danger to his life. When Superman finally finishes, he spots a camera on top of a building some ways off. Before he can investigate who is responsible for the camera, it explodes.</p><p>The Toyman is impressed by Superman's vision.</p><p>Inside the Planet, Perry is ordering his staff to get on this story since it happened on their doorstep. Jimmy noticed something familiar during the battle and tries mentioning it to Perry. All Perry is concerned about is whether or not he got good shots of Superman. He tells him to get them developed right away and sends him off. Tired of being treated this way, Jimmy hands the camera over to Clark and leaves to take care of his own lead.</p><p>Jimmy is determined to prove that he's not just a \"kid with a camera\" and plans on finding out who was behind the toy attack. He also feels assured since he has his wrist watch from Superman. At the same time, Toyman watches the footage of the fight. He sees a point when all three of his creations stopped at the same time. He figures there must have been some sort of conflicting signal. This is strange since he only uses frequencies beyond the sonic range of machines in Metropolis. Unless someone has a \"supercharged dog whistle.\"</p><p>Jimmy exits a cab across town. As he pays the driver, a kid runs by and steals his money. Upset, Jimmy signals the watch to teach the kid a lesson. Clark hears the signal and makes his move to leave. Perry is also looking for Clark so he can't let himself be seen leaving. He goes into a supply closet (that happens to have a window) and decides that might just be better than heading to the roof. As Superman arrives, Jimmy is embarrassed and tries to explain what happened. Superman simply flies off. As he leaves, he tells himself that if this happens one more time, he'll take the watch back.</p><p>Jimmy later does some research. He tries calling different toy manufacturers to see who could have made the giant toys (he didn't realize there were so many in Metropolis). Jimmy finally gets a lead and heads over to Winslow Schott's place. Toyman recognizes that Jimmy was there when Superman was fighting his toys. He allows Jimmy inside and apprehends him. He notices Jimmy trying to reach for his wristwatch. He also notices that it's an odd watch with no numbers or display except for one button. He knows better than to push it since that's obviously what Jimmy was trying to do. He figures he should check it out. He starts up a buzzsaw to assist in removing the watch from Jimmy's wrist...</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Where has Nick Fury been and who are the new Howling Commandos? It’s the debut of all-new characters and some surprising revelations about some classic ones as Nick starts to put his plan to stop the Invasion together. But will it be enough?</p><p>The Eisner award-winning team of Bendis and Maleev bring this very important Secret Invasion issue to life.</p><p>Six months ago in Oregon, Daisy Johnson is approached by a man that looks a bit like Samuel L. Jackson, but wearing an eye patch. She mentions that he reminds her of Nick Fury, who used to run S.H.I.E.L.D. She mentions how he had once come to here and asked if she wanted to save the world in his \"Secret War.\" That cost him his job and she was forced into mandatory S.H.I.E.L.D. retirement. Nick tells her that he got her from, what he called, his Caterpillar Files. Those are files he keeps on kids that have the potential to become something big. No one else in the government knows about those files. He tells Daisy that he wants her to help gather the other Caterpillars. She asks why he needs this team. Nick replies that it's because no one knows them. They can be trusted. Daisy agrees.</p><p>First stop is the Bronx. Daisy finds Alexander, Ares, the God of War's son. She finds him \"scaring the holy hell\" out of some bullies just by looking at them. She refers to him as Phobos, God of Fear. She says he has the power of a god in the body of a ten year old. Alexander seems enlightened by this.</p><p>In Puerto Rico, a street thug grabs the purse of a young lady. She runs after him and suddenly finds she has ran past him and ended up in another part of Puerto Rico. Just as suddenly, she is pulled back like a ricochet. Standing there waiting, Daisy greets Yo Yo Rodriguez. Her father was the Griffin. Yo Yo asks Daisy if that means she's a mutant and Daisy says no. She can take her to someone that can help her.</p><p>In Atlanta, Georgia, at a convenience store, Daisy watches as a punk steals some stuff and the clerk simply sits back. She asks him why he let the guy steal stuff. He says she did too. He says what he's paid isn't worth risking his life. She mentions the fact that he has powers. Surprised she knew, J.T. Slade takes her out back to show her what he can do. He was out at a club with a girl and her brother came at him with a chain. He caught it out of reflex and somehow charged it up in flames. He asks Daisy if she saw him do it. She tells him no but that he's the grandson of the original Ghost Rider (Phantom Rider). After asking if she's from Hydra or S.H.I.E.L.D. he agrees to go with her, more in the hopes of making some money.</p><p>Later she visits X-Factor Investigations in search of Layla Miller. Layla knew she was coming and says she can't go with her. She is needed somewhere else. She tells Daisy that she will survive but may lose a lot before she becomes \"one of the greats.\"</p><p>Outside the boarded up Sanctum Sanctorium of Dr. Strange, a young man stands staring in the rain. Daisy says she just left Hawaii looking for him. The man is desperate and wonders if this is a test of Dr. Strange's. He has connections to the magics and doesn't understand how they work. All he has is a book left to him by his father, Dr. Druid, but he can't read the language. Daisy tells him it's not a matter of magic, he has monster DNA but knows someone that can help him. The man is overjoyed.</p><p>In Minneapolis, Minnesota, a man is bailed out of jail. Daisy tells him that within a day his record won't even exist anymore. He says the whole thing wasn't his fault and goes with her.</p><p>In one of Nick Fury's safehouses, the Caterpillars are all gathered. Fury tells them that every day for the rest of their lives they will do as he says. If they don't, they will die. He doesn't mean it as a threat but a fact. They will begin their training. He asks them if any of them knows what a Skrull is.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>There's a contract out on The Taskmaster, and no shortage of villains willing to fulfill it. But what'll kill him first -- the bad guys, or his latest class of recruits? Welcome Annex, Prodigy, Gorilla Girl, Sunstreak and Batwing to the Initiative. But are they -- is anyone -- ready for the coming of...Butterball??</i></p><p>SYNOPSIS ASSEMBLE!</p><p>• A new group of cadets makes its way to Camp Hammond. Their reasons for coming to train as part of the Initiative Program are as varied as their powers. The potential recruits include anti-registration figure Prodigy, former villains Sunstreak and Batwing, Gorilla Girl, Annex, and newcomer Emery Schaub, who calls himself Boulder.</p><p>FRESH FISH</p><p>• Upon their arrival, they are greeted by Hank Pym, one of the masterminds behind the Initiative and the founding Avengers known as Yellowjacket. Boulder is at a loss for words at meeting Pym, and blubbers on and on about his achievements. Others are not so impressed...</p><p>DISRESPECT</p><p>• Pym disregards the comment, but he loses his cool when Boulder asks him what it was like to pull Captain America out of the ice.</p><p>• The recruits are then introduced to Taskmaster, who will be their drill instructor over the months to come. He quickly puts them in their place, most notably by dubbing Emery \"Butterball,\" telling him he has to earn his codename.</p><p>• Over the next few weeks, the young cadets train and the Initiative Staff assess their performance. Emery is the focus of most of their discussions. Pym and War Machine feel that his power of invulnerability is too valuable to go to waste, but Taskmaster points out that the kid doesn't excel in any way...he's not strong, or fast, or smart or even skilled.</p><p>• And what's worse...he just doesn't \"get it.\" When Emery points out that Taskmaster isn't qualified to train them because, due to his photographic reflexes he himself has never had to train at anything, Taskmaster decides to punish the other cadets to try and motivate him. But that doesn't work either...when the cadets try and give Emery a beating like Private Pile in 'Full Metal Jacket,' his invulnerability lets him sleep right through it.</p><p>• Pym tells Taskmaster to keep working to see what he can do with the boy. He also points out that they have increased security because there is a price on Taskmaster's head. It seems that the criminal community doesn't appreciate that the Taskmaster has decided to work with the Initiative.</p><p>• One night, bored and restless, the cadets decide to sneak off base for a little fun. They head to the beach to relax and do some drinking. When Prodigy suggests that they go skinny-dipping, he is surprised when Gorilla Girl agrees. He quickly pulls off his uniform...and finds her naked, as well, although it's not quite what he expected...</p><p>NUDE SCENE</p><p>• While the others go swimming, both Emery and Sunstreak stay on the beach. Discussing his powers, she realizes that he can't be hurt...which means he can't be burned. Since she is always red hot, she realizes that she can touch him without hurting him. Excited by the idea, she comes on to him, but he can't quite deal with it and he runs off.</p><p>• He takes off in the jeep that they took from camp, leaving them all behind. He is quickly confronted by the Initiative Staff, who have come looking for him. He tells them that he snuck off base alone, and the other cadets overhear this. They are impressed that he didn't rat them all out...but they don't have long to reconsider their feelings for him as a group of super villains show up to collect the bounty on Taskmaster.</p><p>• Led by King Cobra, Mauler, Firebrand and Mr. Hyde attack the Initiative Staff with Emery standing by realizing how out of place he is...</p><p>FISH OUT OF WATER</p><p>• The other cadets leap into the fray, which throws the staff members off their game. Despite the distraction, Yellowjacket still manages to take out Mr. Hyde, their deadliest foe. Realizing that they had better retreat, the Mauler decides to take one of the kids hostage so that he and his allies can make their escape. He grabs Emery and puts his energy cannon to the boys head, telling Pym and the others to back off...</p><p>BAD IDEA</p><p>• With no risk to Emery due to his invulnerability, the staff members take Mauler out. The remaining villains flee, and War Machine pursues them. Yellowjacket stays and keeps the cadets from rushing off after the villains to avoid any other potentially disastrous situations. He also tells the kids that he is impressed.</p><p>• The next day, Yellowjacket and War Machine tell Emery that they've decided to send him home. They realize that despite his ability, he isn't cut out for combat. As Emery packs up his things, the other cadets tell him how jealous they are that he is going home. But Emery is not happy about leaving at all.</p><p>• Watching the display, Taskmaster and Constrictor realize how upset the kid is and they decide to give him a parting gift...a picture that will help him remember his time at Camp Hammond...</p>",

As he begins to fight off the android, Jay Garrick, the Flash arrives to disassmble the samuroid. It turned out the murder victim was a friend of Jay's.</p><p>It turns out the samuroids were built by T.O. Morrow and came under the possession of the Penguin after the Riddler paid off a debt to him. The Penguin wants to have Bruce Wayne killed since Wayne Enterprises won't sell the supplies their start up company needs to become the first in the global security business.</p><p>Jay follows Batman back to the cave to try to figure out who else could be in danger. Jay tries talking to Batman about the inevitable day that he'll have to \"pass the baton\" of Batman. Batman avoids the conversation. As they head upstairs, Jay takes a patrol of the estate and discovers more samuroids making their move towards the mansion.</p><p>Jay soon realizes that while the samuroids have more decorations on them, they are also faster. He also realizes that the ones he's fighting are simply a distraction as others have made their way to the mansion.</p><p>Inside Bruce finds three samuroids ready to attack him. He wonders why so many when one would be enough to take out Bruce Wayne. He then figures either he's earned the respect of someone or it's just someone that does things in excess...like the Penguin. Jay enters and asks why there isn't any security. Bruce tells him it wasn't activated in order to draw them in. Jay doesn't want to risk Bruce's life and says they need to get back downstairs. Unfortunately their path is blocked. So Jay vibrates them through the floor.</p><p>Since the samuroids are being run on a chemical artificial intelligence, Jay says the form of bacteria they have will be susceptible to antibiotics. He uses Batman's lab to create a gas that will neutralize them. Only the gas will be poisonous to them too. Batman puts on a gas mask and heads to cause a distraction while Jay readies the gas to run through the ventilation system.</p><p>They soon trace the 'droids to a factory and find T.O. Morrow there. Jay isn't too happy with the fact that Morrow murdered one of his friends. He has set demolitions all over the factory and threatens to leave Morrow inside. Morrow quickly says he'll confess to everything but begs that his \"children\" aren't hurt. Batman explains to Jay that Morrow develops an attachment to his creations (just as he did with Red Tornado). Before they can do anything, T.O. Morrow escapes into the timestream.</p><p>The factory explodes and the two need to depart to answer distress calls from the JLA and JSA. They leave with a great respect for each other.</p><p>Batman is fighting off the samuroids but the swarm of them is getting to be too much even for him.</p>",
