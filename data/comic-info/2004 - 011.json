            "description": "<p>Joe Ledger (Doctor Spectrum) is sent to investigate the blast site where General Casey attempted to kill Hyperion (Mark Milton) using a twenty-kiloton blast with Hyperion at ground zero. His handlers particularly want to know whether Hyperion has survived the blast. Using the crystal, Ledger locates the cave that Hyperion took shelter in following the attack. Joe's persona loses control and he has no memory for a period of about ten minutes.</p><p>Zarda tells Hyperion their origin. They were released from a large ship in small cradle-pods in pairs to seed planets. As they were released, an enemy attacked their parent ship, and their two cradle-pods went by different paths to the same destination. Zarda arrived on Earth two thousand years earlier than Mark. She tells him the story again, this time wrapped in the language of myth, they are the children of gods, who went to war but left their children behind, and begins to tell the story a third time, only to realize that her mind is clouded with confusion. The one thing she is certain of is their purpose: to conquer, kill, and rule the Earth in preparation for a wave of their people.</p><p>Kyle Richmond (secretly Nighthawk) awards Stanley Stewart (the Blur) a giant check which will be used to fund a scholarship in his name to promote the education and rise of African Americans. After the ceremony, Kyle takes Stanley aside and asks him tough questions about what he intends to actually do with his life other than collect endorsement money from big businesses. Kyle entrusts Stewart with his secret vigilante identity and challenges him to join him that night. When they meet later, it emerges that Nighthawk is investigating the deaths of prostitutes in the Chicago area. They sneak into a building avoiding guards and in the basement find a massive pile of human limbs, rent from bodies by sheer force. Nighthawk speculates that the killer is another super powered being, full of evil.</p><p><b>General Notes</b></p><p>Richard Isanove contributes inks to the cover only.</p>",

Meanwhile, the kidnappers are deciding what to do with Emma and decides to look her up somewhere until they figure something out. The media has begun surrounding the Frost mansion with questions about his daughter's ransom. Winston has begun to act like he really cares because he has to keep up his reputation and actually care for his daughter in the eyes of the cameras.

            "description": "<p><em>The mansion and its new young residents get a shake-up when a member of the original New Mutants team comes home. But Rahne Sinclair - a.k.a. Wolfsbane - is not the sweet little girl she used to be. Also, can the Xavier Institute help a mutant girl who has been living homeless on the streets of Salem Center?</em></p><p>This issue compares Rahne Sinclair and Laurie Collins side by side. We go through all of Rahne's history and learn Laurie's origin. Every page or so it switches from Rahne's story to Laurie's story. Alot of the narration is similar in each story, which really makes this ish stronger.</p><p><i>Synopsis</i></p><p>Present: We start off in Laurie and Sofia's room. They hear Rahne come back with Josh, but its after curfew, AND they're on detention, AND Josh blew off his classes that day, so they know Josh'll get in even more trouble if he's caught. Laurie decides to help him sneak in.</p><p>Past: Laurie's father had the same powers that she has. He used his powers to gain status in the world, and rape women without them even knowing it was rape (because they thought they wanted him at the time). Eventually he wanted Gail Collins. But after she became pregnant with Laurie, his powers stopped working on her, so she found out the truth and left.</p><p>Present: Laurie gets downstairs to find that Rahne has disemboweled Josh.</p><p>Past: Rahne's father also influenced people, but through the Church. But he was also an evil man, and participated in many sins himself... including lust. One day a \"lady of the night\" became pregnant with his child, so after the lady died, he took the baby in as a ward of the Church. Rahne basically became cinderella, and lived with Reverand Craig as he beat religion into her, and taught her to be ashamed of herself.</p><p>Gail raised Laurie by herself, but worked long hours and multiple jobs to make enough money to support them, so Laurie didnt see her very much. Laurie found ways to entertain herself, such as puzzles and crosswords. She never reached out to people because she could see that her mother had been hurt before (very powerful panel of Laurie listening at her mother's bedroom door as Gail sits up at night crying).</p><p>When Rahne turned 14, she transformed into a wolf for the first time... and she loved it.</p><p>When Laurie turned 13, her pheromone powers activiated for the first time. She was popular, all the kids at the beach loved her... and she loved it.</p><p>But the reverand saw her transform, and told her she was evil. He tried to kill her.</p><p>Laurie's mother immediately understood what happened, and taught Laurie never to use her powers, because its not fair to control other people's feelings and emotions. Laurie withdrew even more from those around her. Unfortunately, that didnt work (flashback to the scene at the beginning of issue #2, where we see a school freak out because of Laurie's fear pheromones).</p><p>*\"Salvation came to Rahne in the form of a <b>mother</b>.\"*</p><p>Dr. Moira MacTaggert sent Rahne to a special school where she met other mutants, and made friends.</p><p>*\"The solution to Laurie's <b>problem</b> came from her <b>mother</b>.\"*</p><p>Gail sent Laurie to a special school where she met other mutants... but she didnt make any friends.</p><p>Rahne grew up with the New Mutants, but was still a shy girl who feared her feelings. She still feared the wolf inside her, and she still suffered alot (shot of Doug Ramsey's grave).</p><p>Laurie didnt make any friends at Xavier's, and none of her roommates worked out. Angel Salvatore was affected by Laurie's pheromone powers. Cessily Kincaid was immune to those powers, but still didnt bond with Laurie.</p><p>Then, Rahne's worst nightmare came true: she was transformed permanantly into a beast. She felt all her emotions stronger than ever, and couldnt control any of them. Her powers terrified her.</p><p>Then, Laurie's worst nightmare came true: she also saw how terrifying her powers could be. There was a riot at Xavier's, where students attacked human visitors. Laurie hid in her room, but felt many emotions such as fear, anger, and panic. She wondered, was SHE causing the riot outdoors? Was that how powerful she was? Her powers terrified her.</p><p>Eventualy, Rahne regained control of her powers, and even confronted her father once and for all. But then a villain took away her powers. She was free of the wolf inside her forever... but it left her powerless to save her mother as the villain killed her.</p><p>Eventually, Laurie made a friend who refused to walk away. Through Sofia, she met David and Kevin, and was happy for the first time. But then a villain attacked her new friends. Laurie used her powers willingly for the first time ever, and she scared away the villains. But she also scared her friends, who could not help her when the villain killed her.</p><p>After her mother died, Rahne wandered around, confused, upset, and hurt. She came back to visit her friends, but she was changed. She angered her friends, and felt urges that she couldnt blame on the wolf.</p><p>*\"She was all but <b>lost</b>. Until she met <b>Josh</b>.\"*</p><p>He gave her the wolf back, and she attacked him for it.</p><p>Laurie was stabbed through the heart.</p><p>*\"She was all but <b>dead</b>. Until she met <b>Josh</b>.\"*</p><p>Josh healed Laurie, and she fell in love. Unfortunately, Josh was interested in someone else. Someone who just attacked him...</p><p>Present: Laurie uses her powers correctly to scare away Rahne. She runs off, and Laurie kneels by Josh's side, who just passed out...</p>",

This prisoner is the Fallen One, first herald to Galactus, a cosmic-powered sociopath looking to even an old score with its former master!</em></p><p>Cole's team tries to quell the Kyln's inmates. Skreet takes Thanos to a series of cocoons, and explains that one of them belonged to The Fallen One, the first herald to Galactus, whom Thanos has never heard of before. The Fallen One was relieved of duty for being too pathological.</p><p>Cole and Starlord find Thanos. It turns out that Starlord is the one who brought the Fallen One to the Kylns in the first place, but he doesn't want to talk about it. Starlord and Skreet also have a tense moment between them based on previous history.</p><p>Starlord gets Mynx back from Skreet and restores her to her normal size. Gladiator grabs Starlord and tells him that he is now conscripted to Gladiator's unit.</p><p>Thanos eventually decides that the Fallen One is going after Galactus, who could normally easily defeat him. Right now, however, Galan is still weakened from his battle with Hunger. Thanos goes to warn Galactus, who already knows. Meanwhile, the Fallen One is on his way.</p>",
