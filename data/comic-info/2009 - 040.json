            "description": "<i>Following last issue, Supergirl must decide what to do with a shocking piece of information that casts all of \"New Krypton\" in a new light! Meanwhile, Lois begins putting together clues regarding the body found in Metropolis Harbor and the strange message it was broadcasting.<br/></i><br/>Supergirl is being questioned about Superwoman at the Metropolis Police Precinct # 55, home of the Metropolis metacrimes division. She says that Superwoman was living in Kandor with the rest of the Kryptonians and that she thought she was a friend, but also believes her friend Thara Ak-Var can't be Superwoman because that would mean she helped Reactron murder her father. Then Major Lane comes in and says Superwoman was found at the corner of Malverne and Siegel Avenue. Supergirl hurries off while Lane begins to talk to the inspector about national security and keeping a Kryptonian in his police station. Supergirl flies while thinking about Thara's connection in her father's murder. She soon spots Superwoman and flies toward her but as she does she realizes that the \"Superwoman\" was just a decoy and then Reactron attacks her and uses Gold Kryptonite on her, taking away her powers temporarily. Supergirl acts quickly and uses her cape to make sure she lands safely just as Reactron comes down and beins to attack again. Meanwhile, Cat Grant and Lana Lang are talking to each other at a party while Jimmy Olsen is flirting with a bunch of girls. Lana tells Cat about how she sometimes worries about niece since her father passed away when suddenly they see something happen through the window. Supergirl is getting attacked by Reactron who tells her the truth about his suit and that the old suit he had was not a piece of space that was fused with him giving him power over it all, but rather a suit to save his life as he's dying and if it wasn't for her, the suit would have saved him from his radiation sickness. But he had managed to get a new suit and he also enjoyed killing her father. Supergirl then attacks him and tells him that she had trained with Batman, and even though she has no powers, she can still defend herself pretty well. As they fight, Supergirl removes the Gold Kryptonite from Reactron and tosses it away. Reactron then disappears while Supergirl starts getting her powers back. She then looks at Superwoman's cape and sees something she never noticed before and realizes who she is and flies off. Then the Inspector is talking to the commissioner over the phone, telling them that he did not feel he was endangering national security by keeping a Kryptonian with him and says he thought she could help him solve a murder and enters a room only to find that part of the room had been destroyed by heat vision. Back at the party, Lana, Cat, and Jimmy are leaving and talking to each other when all of a sudden Lana starts feeling weird and passes out, while the Inspector enters his room cautiously and without realizing Superwoman is right above him. Superwoman then blasts him with heat vision and makes a remark saying he should tell his men there's an intruder in his office. Supergirl then flies into the office and attacks Superwoman angrily and asks why she pretended to be her friend while helping with her father's murder and proceeds to unmask her at the same time, revealing Superwoman to be Major Lane.",

So as he prepares to take her inheritance right from under her nose Sela decides it's time to pay him a visit before things go terribly wrong. There is a fine line between need and greed and one con man is about to learn that once that line is crossed, there may be no going back.</i> <br /> <br /> Meant to be an analogy to Paris Hilton/Lindsey Lohan, the story with Jillian Howard tells of a spoiled rich girl.  Her pool attendant is shown to be Sela, who offers her a different path.  After a near fatal car accident in which she was drinking she ran into an empty school bus.  Afterwards she is visited by Sela who reads her the story of the Goose and the Golden Egg.  This is about a poor old couple who think that their fortunes have changed with the golden eggs, but can only ever get more of them to feed their increasingly expensive lifestyles.  As the story cuts back to modern day, Jillian says she has learned her lesson but instead decides on a big party for her friends.  She is visited once again by Sela who tells her that she must really change her way, but Jillian fires Sela instead.  It is then revealed at Sela's insistence that her father has cut her off financially.  Instead of learning her lesson she steal her dead mother's jewelry and travels to Australia.  There she charters a boat to go snorkeling, but once she is ready to be brought out of the water, it is revealed that the skipper is in fact Belinda.  As a shark attacks her, Belinda reveals to her that she belongs to her now.",

We've done that often enough before. But after a while, the lies and misdirection and carefully constructed half-truths begin to weary a man's soul. Let's just say that by the end of this issue, both Jacks get what's coming to them.</i>",
