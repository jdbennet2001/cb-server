Meanwhile, Annie January (alias Starlight) has her own doubts about membership of The Seven. This storyline also reveals a little more about the other members of the team- beginning with Butcher, and his relationship with CIA director Susan Rayner.</i></p><p>Starlight is sitting in a church and wants to know if God is out there or not. She can't understand the things she's had to go through lately since joining the Seven. She figures that if God is there, he must be sadistic. She has really been let down since seeing that the Seven don't really do much to save others. It's mainly been about corporate sponsorship.</p><p>Butcher has more sex with Director Rayner. She continues to curse and tell him she hates him the entire time.</p><p>Wee Hughie visits the Legend. The Legend informs him that the Blarney Cock is back in town. Hughie is shocked because he was the one that accidentally killed him after first getting Compound V in his system. The Legend tells him that this happens from time to time. Capes die all the time but have so much Compound V in them that it simply jump-starts their bodies. The Legend tells Hughie he has to kill him again. When they come back, their minds aren't really there. Plus Butcher wants it known that when the Boys kill someone, they stay killed. He also tells Hughie to do it as a favor for him. Hughie says he'll do it but then wants all his questions about the Boys answered. The Legend agrees, saying he's earned the right to know where he stands.</p><p>Starlight travels back home to visit her former teammates, the Young Americans. Arriving unannounced, she walks in on Drummer Boy having sex with Holy Mary. He claimed he was lonely and didn't know if she was coming back or not. Everything she's known, her heroes, her friends, and maybe even her god have been a lie. Thinking that perhaps God isn't there, she leaves the church. In the park, she runs into Wee Hughie and falls, in tears, into his arms.</p>",

But by the time Stark uncovers the truth, it might very well be too late. For Khonshu has great expectations of his avatar -- he wants the streets washed with</p><p>blood, and what Khonshu wants, he usually gets.</p><p><b>Spoilers</b></p><p>Tony Stark watches a video of Moon Knight beating the crap out of a skinhead. He tells the agent with him that they need to prevent this from getting out. He wonders how he was able to pass his psych exam and decides they need to look into that.</p><p>Marc Spector is training with Rob as Frenchie watches on. Marc's hitting a punching bag as Rob holds it. Rob is excited over the news coverage Moon Knight is getting. He asks what the guy he beat up named Maddicks do. Marc doesn't want to talk about it. Rob keeps pushing and Marc accidentally hits the bag so hard, it hits Rob in the nose. Frenchie isn't too happy. As he takes Rob away to stop the bleeding, he turns back to Marc. He tells him there was no need for what he did to Maddicks. That battle was fought long ago.</p><p>A subway tunnel worker, Carson Knowles, reaches the end of his shift. On his locker is a newspaper clipping with the headline, \"Black Spectre released from jail.\" A couple of his co-workers gives him a hard time and laugh at him as he leaves.</p><p>Frenchie tries nursing Rob's bloody nose. He tells him he should stay away from Marc. Rob thinks Frenchie's jealous that they're building a friendship that doesn't rely on him. Frenchie tells him that people close to Marc simply get hurt. The squabble continues and Rob ends up leaving.</p><p>Carson has to visit with his parole officer. He notes that he's been staying out of trouble and also that it's payday. Carson tells him he's not going to pay him. The parole officer curses him out and tells him he'll go straight back to jail if he doesn't. He tells him he doesn't have any rights anymore. Not too happy, Carson pays him and leaves.</p><p>Marc and Marlene finish up some activities in his bedroom. They begin to argue and she asks why he moved the statue of Khonshu in there. He says he needs it but Marlene says it just reminds her of her father. He becomes distracted by Khonshu as he makes himself look like Tigra, reminding Marc of his past relationship. Marlene decides to leave because she doesn't want to argue.</p><p>Everyone is feeling down. Carson visits a pawn shop and picks up an old item in a long box. Frenchie pulls out a gun he had hidden beneath the floorboards in his place. Marc takes out the cut off face of Bushman that he sliced off his face. Frenchie stares at an old photograph and holds the gun up in anguish. Carson looks into the reflection of the sword he got and sees his Black Spectre costume. He says, \"Welcome home.\" In the bathroom, Marc takes the face and puts it on his own. At that moment, Marlene walks in after decided to turn around and go back to Marc. She is horrified with what she sees. He drops the face and yells out to her. A hand picks up the face and says he's been looking for that. It appears as if Bushman himself is standing there with the face back on.</p>",

A major SECRET INVASION chapter is here! Oh, but you want to know exactly who we're talking about right? Spoilers, dude!</em></p><p><em>This issue centers itself around one of main keys in the Invasion: Henry Pym and how was he replaced.</em></p><h4>Spoiler Warning</h4><p>The issue begins with Hank giving a lecture on \"Advanced Genetic Analysis\" in the Sheldonian Theatre. We jump to after his speech were he allows the many students watching to ask him questions. One asks does Hank think that his adventures with the Avengers have changed the \"course of [his] research\". He explains that he does think it did, and that anything can change everything, as tells the audience a story about Reed Richards, and when he once got an idea for a one of his biggest success from watching his son (Franklin Richards) play with building blocks, and he continues to talk about how the smallest things can affect their work. He does this while staring at a blonde girl in the audience, who raises her hand next and asks why did the Avengers break up, to which he smiles slightly and tells her that in his mind, they're just taking a break, and if they are needed he believes they will return. The two then stare at each other.</p><p>In his office at home (we presume), Hank types away on a computer, and then here's a door crash behind him. It's Wasp, Janet, and she tells him she's home, and he tells here that he's \"in here\". She states that he's still up, and she tells him that she forgot where they lived, and he replies sarcastically, to which she says that they've only lived there a month, and he asks her, obviously angry, where she was, and she explains that she was with Tom Ford, a friend who she had dinner with, and Tom brought friends and they talked business, and then Hank points out to us that she is drunk. She replies telling him she was out, and that she had a good time and she's sorry she has friends, and that she has to \"shmooze a little\" to get the business back up and running, while she enters the bathroom. Hank asks her, well more demanded her to go to bed, and she shouts back, carrying a tooth brush and now in her under garments, that he was the one who wanted to move to England, and he repeats his earlier comment, adding that she is drunk, and then Janet pops her head around the door saying that she could have kissed someone, but she didn't. Hank raises her voice, and tells her to go to bed, and she slams the door, questioning herself on why she didn't stay in New York, and after she leaves, Hank quietly asks \"Why didn't you?\"</p><p>Next morning, and it appears that Hank fell asleep at his desk, as he wakes up in his chair. He calls for Janet, and walks to the bedroom to she that the bed is empty, and then he moves onto the closet, to see that all of Janet's clothes are gone. He walks into the bathroom to see a not taped to the mirror, saying bye, to which Hank remarks \"Classy.\"</p><p>Next, and we jump to Hank in bed with the blonde student from his lecture before (the one who was staring at him). She asks can she ask him sothing, and he tells her to go ahead, and she asks \"Aren't you married?\", to which he replies that now she asks (presumably because they're in bed, naked, together, I think its safe to assume that they slept together). She explains that she knows that he's married, but why did he sleep with her if he is. He explains that he's seperated, and then they talk about that. She then tells him that he's the oldest guy she's slept with, and Hank takes offence, telling her that he's not old, she then comforts him saying it wasn't an insult. He asks does she have a roommate, which she tells him no while putting on a t-shirt that's to big for her, and then he asks does she have the internet, and she replies affirmative. He then goes to tell her that she can't tell anyone, but before he can finish, she tells him that she won't. She tells him that her mother would die if she saw her \"canoodling\" with anyone, and he appriciates that. She then claims that he'll probably be going back to America, and he asks why she'd think that, and she shows him the laptop displaying a picture and article about the New Avengers, but he explains that they have nothing to do with him, as it was another life, and he intends to work on his research there in England. She confirms this by asking if he's staying to which he replies yes, and he asks her out to dinner, and she accepts, excited as she has a \"billion questions\".</p><p>The next page shows the two doing various things together, eating out at a restaurant, the two in a kitchen and Hank making coffee, the two taking a stroll, the two coming out of a shop and then in a bar, and she is asking a different question in every different situation. The last panel of this page then shows her asking about the Kree-Skrull war, and then we see that the two are sitting on a bed, her naked and Hank in his underwear, Hank also with a tub of ice cream, the two with spoons, and Hank going to feed her. He tells her that's going back, and she asks if it was real, to which he replies yes. She tells him that her brother constantly visits conspiracy websites and stuff, and Hank then tells her that from his experience, most conspiracies are true. He then tells her about the Kree, and about that they're noble, and that \"we\" will most probably be like them in ten thousand years. He asks if she knows who Captain Marvel is, and continues on telling her that he's a Kree, and then she asks about Skrulls. He says its going to bother her, but he tells her that they're shapeshifters.</p><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li>Cover is an homage to Avengers <a href=\"/the-avengers-213-court-martial/4000-21654/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-21654\">#213</a>, November, 1981.</li></ul>",
