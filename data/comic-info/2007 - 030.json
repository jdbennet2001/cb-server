            "description": "<p>Fry, Bender, and Leela are on a delivery mission.  Fry realizes that his toes look a lot like little fingers.  They are delivering baseball memorbilia to a rich collector, named Granville Byers IV (Grabby to his friends, if he had any).  The package consists of Barry Bonds in suspended animation.  With this final aquisition, Grabby has completed his run of the 2006 San Francisco Giants.<br/></p><p>The gang notice all of his collection on display.  Bender simply sees the monetary value of the \"old\" stuff.  Fry notices that one display stand is empty.  It is reserved for a mint copy of Space Boy #150 \"The Death of Space Boy.\"  Apparently there are no longer any copies in existance.  Grabby says he'd pay anything to get a copy (within reason, of course).  Bender literally has dollar signs in his eyes.<br/></p><p>Back at Planet Express, Bender is trying to draw a copy of Space Boy #150 to try to sell it to Grabby.  Fry scoffs at it saying it looks nothing like the issue.  He would know because he used to own a copy.  It turns out that in trying to hide it from his brother, Fry hid his copy at work.  Bender insists they go look for it.  Leela goes to supervise and Zoidberg goes just to go on a \"field trip.\"</p><p>In Old New York, Fry finally finds their way to Panucci's Pizza.  After eating a slice of pizza left on the counter (they were never made with real ingredients so it's still perfectly fresh), Fry finds the comic hidden behind a loose brick in the bathroom.<br/></p><p>Bender keeps trying to horn in on Fry's coming fortune.  When Fry decides to go to the phone to sell it to Grabby, the others tell him to use IDbay.  Putting on a virtual helmut and staring at the comic, bidders will be able to think their bids to Fry.  There is another bidder besides Grabby.  The bidding war goes on but Grabby finally wins.<br/></p><p>As they return to Grabby's planet, Fry and Bender continue to fight over the comic.   Suddenly the ship is attacked and borded.  Mom is there with her three sons/guards.  It turns out that Mom was bidding anonymously on the comic.  When she lost, her only alternative was to simply hijack them.  She's not interested in the comic afterall.  She is more interested in the plastic that has preserved the comic for ten centuries.  She figures if she can replicate it, she'll make a fortune.  She throws the comic to the boys who fight over it and end up ripping it to shreads.  As Fry and Bender lament over the ruined remains, Bender wonders if they could tape it back together and sell it.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The best-selling Captain America series continues its most shocking story ever!</em> <em>It's the Winter Soldier versus everyone in this senses-shattering conclusion to the first arc of the EPIC \"Death of Captain America\" storyline. Winter Soldier versus Crossbones - the man who sniped Cap! Winter Soldier versus S.H.I.E.L.D. and Tony Stark's hand-picked Mighty Avengers operative! Winter Soldier versus the Red Skull! And finally - the Winter Soldier versus himself! You'll have to be there to see it!</em></p><p>Tony Stark is trying to figure out how they were infiltrated. It's figured out that the agents that dropped off the grid have had psychiatric evaluations with Dr. Benjamin (Dr. Faustus in disguise). There is a report of something in the basement when Tony gets a call from the Black Widow. It turns out that Dr. Benjamin is dead in a freezer. He appears to have been there for some time.</p><p>In Aleksander Lukin's office, the Winter Soldier is taking pounches from Crossbones and Sin. Lukin puts on the Red Skull mask as the Skull finally reveals himself. He asks Bucky if the Lukin he knew would willingly work with the Red Skull. Getting his bearings, the Winter Soldier quickly puts down Crossbones and Sin. He walks up to Crossbones saying, \"You...you shot my friend.\" He grabs him by the throat and lifts him up. Crossbones is beginning to choke as the Red Skull comments how Steve Rogers wouldn't resort to murder as an option in dealing with an enemy. Bucky tosses Crossbones aside yelling at the Skull to stop using his name. Bucky pins him against the window and the Skull utters a single word, \"Sputnik.\" It turns out it was a one-time shutdown code from his old Soviet handlers. Crossbones ask why he waited so long before he used it. He could have killed him. Red Skull says he wanted to see if Bucky would kill Crossbones.</p><p>In the Falcon's apartment, Sam prepares to prep his spare costume after his current one got burned. Black Widow casually enters through the window. She tells Sam that she's looking for the Winter Soldier just like he and Sharon (Agent 13) are.</p><p>At Sharon's apartment, she is in the bathroom in tears. She wants to believe that this must be another trick of the Skull's. Looking down at a pregnancy test, it reveals that she is, in fact, pregnant.</p><p>Tony looks at an old picture of Cap, Bucky, Nick Fury, and Dum Dum. He holds the letter delivered to him from Steve. He curses Steve for making him want a drink. He calls up images from when Steve was shot.</p><p>Elsewhere, Winer Soldier is being tortured by Faust. Images of Cap getting shot are all around on screens. Faust is happy that he's finally come to. He says that he's heard so much about him over the years that he feels as if he already knows him.</p><p>Sharon sits in the shower playing over Steve's last few days. Recalling his last words, she realizes that Steve must have known that it was her that shot him.</p><p>Tony is frustrated that there were over one hundred cameras and news crews yet no one was able to get a clear view of whoever shot Steve. Satellite footage had been diverted and Tony figures Nick must have been behind it. He figures Nick must have had some plan to free Steve and didn't want anyone to see it put in motion. He thinks about Sharon being right by Steve and the fact that she didn't see anything either. Suddenly, he calls down to get a list of all agents that had been evaluated by \"Dr. Benjamin.\"</p><p>Sharon dresses to go out. Grabbing her gun, she looks in the mirror. Standing next to her is the image of Dr. Faustus. He \"tells\" her it's time to work again. The Falcon and Black Widow arrive at her apartment. Sam calls out to her. Sharon says she'll be right out as she grabs something out of her safe.</p><p>Tony Stark finds Sharon's name on the list of patients. He kicks himself for not having pieced this together before. He dresses in his armor knowing that they now have a big problem. He calls the Black Widow. She begins to tell him that she's with Sam and Sharon. Tony tells here there's been a change in plans. She has to bring in Sharon. Before he can continue, Sharon walks out in a trance. She then shoots the two of them with some sort of energy gun.</p><p>As Tony calls his agents to Black Widow's position, Steve's note can be seen. The last lines ask Tony to help Bucky through his time of frustration and anger. He doesn't want Bucky to slip out of his new life. His second request is that Tony not let \"Captain America\" die. He says it is bigger than just him. Tony can't let the legacy die with him.</p>",
