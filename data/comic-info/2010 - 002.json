On the one-night honeymoon allowed them within the prison confines, she convinces him to tell her the truth. The truth is that he had been set up and was innocent of the charges brought against him. Believing his sincere manner, she sets out to find the true culprit of the crime and manages to do so, just in the nick of time, thereby saving Nick from execution. Unfortunately, this also means that her family's debt remains intact since her death-row inmate was pardoned. Furthermore, it turns out that Jack's the son (disowned) of a distinguished noble family. As his wife and still the holder of a large debt, she takes it upon herself to contact her husband's family for help. What will their reaction be...?</em></p>",
