Danielle Baptiste, the newest bearer of The Angelus, begins to explore what this new role means for her, learning what the Angelus truly is, and how it ties into our notions angels and even Heaven itself.

After a harrowing battle with the disgusting and deadly Black Rider creatures, even confident, stalwart combatants like Solomon Kane and the mysterious L'Armon know enough to seek safety during the sinister hours of the night.

Wade Wilson has been tapped to save the Universe, and to do that he's going to need help. Enter: The sexy-but-insecure Lady Deadpool! The devious-but-lovable Headpool (a.k.a. the Zombie Deadpool Head)! The bratty-but-brilliant Kidpool! And the irascible mutt known as Dogpool! Individually, they're, well, kind of messed up, but together, they're the unstoppable force know as DPC.<br /><br /><strong>Summary</strong></i></p><p><em>In this universe most marvel heroes are kids. Professor X wants to tap Emma Frost by having a dance social between Professor X's male students, and Emma Frost's female students. Storm warns the professor about Kidpool so the professor made a plan. Meanwhile Kidpool is seen giving a wedgie to kid Cyclops which caused them both to see Storm. Storm used the professors plan by putting both of them in detention for the whole day. So Kidpool and Cyclops are in the danger room for detention, Cyclops says he has the codes for the danger room. So Kidpool took 2 lightsabers and fought Cyclops until he figured out Cyclops could just unlock the door and leave. So Kidpool and Cyclops are at the dance, Cyclops sees Jean dancing with Wolverine. Cyclolps said he will give Kidpool 20 dollars if he can distract them long enough for him to get to Jean. So Kidpool distracted the students until Wolverine attacked Kidpool along with Angel and Colossus. Storm then broke up the fight and everyone was saying how much they don't like Kidpool until Earth 616 Deadpool came in and said he needed Kidpool. So Kidpool went with Deadpool and Earth 616 Deadpool called Kidpool Tito.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Pixie, Armor, X-23, and Mercury are still missing, but actually they are on their way to attend a Dazzler concert, in what may be Oakland. On Utopia Anole and Rockslide find Blindfold hiding in the girls bathroom, and go report it to Miss Frost. Nightcrawler also report to Frost about Pixies mother, what does this mean? Could it be Pixie is not where she is led to believe with her posse of girls?</i></p><p>Ten hours before the events of last issue, we see Mercury, Armor, X-23 and Pixie (but not Blindfold) riding on Pixie's moped bike. Pixie teleports them to the city and tells them about the secret invitation she got to a private Dazzler show. They are briefly challenged by a mugger with a baseball bat, but Pixie disables him with her dust. She tells the others that the invite only contained GPS coordinates and no other info. As they enter the nightclub Cessily and X-23 sarcastically joke about how ugly the other partiers are. Two of these strangers are demons in disguise - one has been entrusted with tracking Pixie for weeks and tells the other to fix his face on his disguise. The girls (except X-23) are confused by the loud music and bright lights. The show begins with dancers hanging from the ceiling - as they look up they fail to notice the other dancers are now demons and they are knocked out by a strange magic.</p><p>Back in the present in the illusion world, Pixie has now taken some control over the illusion, adapting it to fit her own currently warped sense of reality. She is the Prom Queen at a party attended by the demon 'school children' and is cross with the girls for not going along with things and not wanting to see her happy. Saturnine and the demon nurse look on from afar - the nurse is concerned that the illusion is coming apart too soon with Pixie's intervention and the fact that Pixie didn't come alone to the invite. Saturnine thinks that Pixie is ideal though - she is adaptable and desperate to belong. He wants to find the dark place in her soul.</p><p>Meanwhile on Utopia, Rockslide, Anole, Blindfold and Nightcrawler come to see Emma Frost about the missing girls. When Blindfold starts to talk strangely, Emma begins to take things seriously.</p><p>In the Prom illusion, Pixie demands the girls make an effort to fit in. She pulls out her soulsword, sheathed inside her and stabs Ruth (Blindfold) in the illusion - in reality back on Utopia, Ruth falls to the ground and warns of trouble. She tells the X-Men the other four girls went to the Dazzler show without her because she didn't want to dance. In the illusion, X-23 struggles to stop Pixie and gives a demon a fierce knee to the head. On Utopia, the X-Men search Pixie's room and find the invitation and set off to find her.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mrs Gwynn goes to the Wyngarde mansion where she finds Regan and Martinique who are surprised that she knows about their father, the original Mastermind. She tells them they have been usurped as the babies of the family by Pixie, who is apparently their half-sister (sharing Mastermind as a father).</p>",

And when Daken slaughters a pair of masked assailants in front of witnesses, the world starts to wonder what happened to the Wolverine they knew. Norman Osborn, desperate to spin the attack, decides to stage another assault to prove once and for all that the Wolverine he handpicked for his team of Avengers is on the level, enlisting a gang of C-list villains to serve as punching bags for Daken. But when the villains learn Osborn's plan, they devise a plan of their own - for revenge. Soon, Daken finds himself the hunted instead of the hunter. Does he have the raw survival instincts to muscle through? He'd better hope so. Because even if he fights his way out of this mess, he still has to answer to Osborn. And his father.</em></p><p><em>Collects Dark Wolverine #78-81.</em></p><p>As an Avenger, Daken is supposed to be one of the good guys - to the public, anyway. But when a tape revealing his true colors is leaked onto the internet, Daken will be forced to clean up his act...and confront the possibility that being a hero might just be more difficult than being the villain! Collecting DARK WOLVERINE #78-81.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>It's been nearly 20 years since notorious outlaw Skinner Sweet was buried on boot hill. But when a group of grave-robbing collectors of Western memorabilia uncover his final resting place, they find much, much more than they bargained for. And: Pearl Jones was attacked and left for dead by a cabal of powerful Hollywood vampires. Now, a mysterious stranger comes calling and Pearl gets a second chance at life - and at revenge.</i></p><p>“Morning Star”. 1925. Henry Preston and Hattie Hargrove find a bloodied and bitten Pearl wandering the desert. At the hospital, the doctor doesn’t give Pearl much hope for life. Later in the morgue, Skinner Sweet climbs in the window, bites his lip, draws blood, and kisses Pearl’s eye, thereby turning her into a vampire. Pearl makes it back to her house where Sweet is waiting for her. He breaks the news of her death to her and explains that they are an “evolved” type of vampire, different than the aristocratic European vampires who attempted to prey on them. One big difference is that the sun has no effect on Skinner or Pearl. Skinner departs, but leaves Pearl a gift in her closet – a tied-up Chase Hamilton, who originally led Pearl to slaughter by B. D. Bloch and other vampires. A furious Pearl transforms into a razor-clawed vampire, kills Hamilton, and leaves him in his dressing room.</p><p>“Deep Water”. Will Bunting, narrating from 1925, continues to recount events he witnessed in 1880. After the train wreck and fight with Skinner, James Book falls into a coma and later awakens to the news that Sweet murdered his fiancée with poisoned wine. Book, Felix Camillo, and Bunting head to Cruces to pay their respects. Mr. Percy and his European vampire associates begin to dam the nearby river, thereby putting the town and Sweet’s grave underwater. Years later, scavengers from Lakeview, a nearby town, go diving to steal items from Sweet’s grave only to find he is still very much hungry.</p>",

Hulkpool then came in and moved the missle to the Red Skull's base where Hitler and the Red Skull are. Hulkpool then had the missle land at the base while saving Bucky Barnes and Captain America. Hulkpool then teleports to the time where the truck with toxic waste was going to hit Matt Murdock. Hulkpool saved Murdock (preventing Murdock from getting his powers). Then Hulkpool is sent to the time where Steven Strange was about to have his car crashed until Hulkpool Saved Strange (preventing him to become Dr. Strange). Then he did other preventing stuff like with the Fantastic 4, Iron Man, Spiderman, even the Hulk. So then Hulkpool finally got to Deadpool at a strip club. The two fought each other until Hulkpool killed Deadpool. It also turned out that changing history will only make alternate timelines (kinda like alternate universes).

Since discovering role-playing games, Cyd Sherman spends more and more time in-game as the healer Codex. As her boyfriend ignores her in favor of his fledgling band and her therapist questions whether or not she has \"real\" friends, Cyd decides to form her own group within the game after meeting Clara, who teaches her about reputation points, and Zaboo, who introduces her to \"friending\" within the game. Detailing the never-before-told origin of The Knights of Good, this is essential reading for fans of the show, and a great jumping-on point for readers new to </i><i>The Guild. And don't miss season three of the show at <u>watchtheguild.com</u>!</i>",

            "description": "<i>As U.S. Weapons Inspector Will Haley and his Russian counterpart Anya  Romanova begin to uncover the truth behind the mysterious military  project known only as 'Dosvidanya,' those most closely associated with  the program keep turning up dead. Can this pair of sleuths get past  their cultural differences before the body count rises even further, or  is this just a prelude to the nightmare the Soviets planned for their  enemies? </i> <br/> <br/>In Siberia, there is an ice fisherman (<a data-ref-id=\"4005-71996\" href=\"/yuri-gasgarov/4005-71996/\" slug=\"yuri-gasgarov\">  Yuri Gasgarov</a>) trying to catch a fish. He hears a noise and looks over his shoulder. He sees a little girl and tries to communicate. As he wipes his eyes the girl has disappeared. He chalks it up to being too long on the ice and goes about his business. He hears another sound and sees the girl again, this time he gets up to walk towards her and she disappears again. Thinking he must be crazy he begins to gather his belongings and starts to walk back to his truck when he notices small footprints ending where he last saw the girl. Puzzled, he starts to follow the footprints in the snow until they end in the middle of the lake. The ice starts to crack and the says his prayers and asks for forgiveness for what he did \"at the projekt\".  The ice breaks and he falls in. As he's underwater he looks at the surface and sees the little girl standing on the ice looking down at him. <br/> <br/>At the Department of Defense makeshift headquarters in Russia, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71988\" href=\"/will-haley/4005-71988/\" slug=\"will-haley\">  Will Haley</a> reports to his superior for instructions. His boss, , tells him that he's heading back to the site to continue investigating weapons of mass destruction. This comes at the request of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71987\" href=\"/anya-romanova/4005-71987/\" slug=\"anya-romanova\">  Anya Romanova</a> of the Russian police. Following orders he heads out to continue his work at the site. Anya mentions how much her country has changed--mostly for the better--and quizzes Will on his Russian history. Nightfall comes and they head for a bar to continue to put pieces of the puzzle together. They chat for a few hours and make their separate ways.  <br/> <br/>On his way out, Will hops in a snow cat and feels a gun pointed at his head. He is instructed not to turn around but to drive. Will realizes that the man is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-71990\" href=\"/boris-konstantin/4005-71990/\" slug=\"boris-konstantin\">  Boris Konstantin</a> and they begin chatting. Konstantin mentions that he knew Anya's father and as he's talking to Will he hypnotizes him. <br/> <br/>A few minutes later, Anya happens to be driving by and stops to find Will passed out over the steering wheel and a cat sitting next to him on the passenger's seat. Will gains his composure and admits to not remembering anything after sitting down to drive home. They get in Anya's car and head to a crime scene. There is a Russian police officer filling out a report of Yuri's death. Anya immediately recognizes him and pretends not to notice. As they're examining the body Will recognizes the voodoo doll in his hand and has a short flashback of the hypnotism. He remembers that Konstantin had slipped a piece of paper in his pocket and examines it carefully while walking away. <br/> <br/>The next day Will and Kip drive to a storage locker and suit up. Will is investigating what was written on the piece of paper slipped into his pocket by Konstantin. They open the storage locker to discover a Tar Tar skeleton. ",

            "description": "<p><i>Somebody wants the super-spy codenamed the Black Widow dead…and they came damn close! Now Natasha Romanoff, recovering and angry, chases the trail with fatal skill!</i></p><h3><i>Issue</i></h3><p>Beginning while the Widow is still in her drugged state in the hospital, she has a dream of the past which she seems to narrate, explaining that she had to do it, but sometimes she wish she hadn't.</p><p>Waking up, eyes wide, she clutches her stomach before lifting the shirt to see the bandages and cringes in pain. Leaning over the bed, she picks up the phone before whispering a code into it so it can begin a trace. Wolverine enters, asking if he's interrupting something, and she says her escape. He tells her that she's suppose to rest in bed for three days, but she ignores him, claiming it's a scratch as the two make some allusions to the Black Night in Monty Python.</p><p>Natasha questions him about his present, and he tells her the Barnes and Stark have been called away and tries to get her to rest so she doesn't split her stitches. She implies that he should, and she says that he should find her clothes, but he tells her he's not that polite before handing her the black rose from where she was attacked. She asks if he found anything else before he says he has to ask her something. Back to inner monologuing, Natasha claims he knows what was taken while leaving the room.</p><p>Monologuing that Wolverine had just warned her and that she doesn't have much time if he knows while walking down the corridor, a nurse attempts to stand her with a needle, but Natasha blocks this and replies with a punch to the face. An unknown narrator then begin talking about accusations brought forth that are solid and need investigation and that they've approved a strike on Natasha, while a \"doctor\" looks at Natasha leaving the corridor while kneeling over the nurse, while speaking into his watch, telling the other side that an agent is down and Natasha is moving.</p><p>In a stair case, Natasha is approached by three guards who say she's supposed to be drugged, and warn her that she must stay still or the will shoot to kill. Natasha claims that she is too weak to stand and asks them not to shoot her as they throw her handcuffs to retrain herself in. She retaliates by throwing them at one of the guards head before knocking out the other two and stealing one of the men's uniform. While this happens, the voice continues to narrate, claiming that they were taking advantage of and that if they hadn't found damning evidence, they wouldn't be sat there, and what they've found is unfortunate: that the \"Black Widow is engaging in acts of... Espionage.\"</p><p>We cut to Iron Man, Captain America (Barnes) and Hawkeye, with Clint replying by telling the man that he'd be more worried if she wasn't doing this. The man then accuses her of spying against them and other superpeople: they'd found a data pill in her body that could contain \"vast amounts of information\", and that the information is very detailed, down to what they wear for underwear. Tony replies in disbelief, and the man tells him that he (Tony) doesn't wear any. Tony goes on to say he's abusing this power, with Clint backing him up by telling the man that Natasha is loyal, but the man claims that she's selling this information to the highest bidder, and Barnes calls him a liar. Rhetorically, the man asks if the Widow hasn't seduced any of them, claiming that this disorientates their judgement, to which Tony tells him he's \"full of crap\" and Barnes brings up the subject that the man used to work with Osborn; the man telling them that was a mistake, and claims that they don't have all the facts about the Widow. Stark's phone begins to ring.</p><p>Pepper Potts is walking down a pavement, asking Tony if he wants to get lunch when she is shot by Lady Bullseye. While this happens, the man narrates, telling the heroes that Natasha was once an enemy of the state and a former Russian spy, one of the deadliest women in the world and that she lead the Avengers; with no superpowers.</p><p>Barnes says that these are positive things, and Clint tells him that he trusts Natasha. Tony, on his phone, raises his voice, asking who's on Pepper's phone, to find out that she's been attacked, knocked out with a sound rifle. As they leave, the man tells Tony that Pepper was listed as his weakness.</p><p>Back to Natasha as she walks into a bar, though to the back and into a room that she put aside as a safe house for herself, while saying that any spy should know that, and this it the first rule. She narrates that the people of the building, Russian and old, owe their lives to the Widow and are paying their debt, as she boils the kettle and removes her bandages before applying new ones. She pours herself a cup of tea and looks at the rose in the evidence bag, saying that she new this would happen, and forgot that secrets don't keep. As she drinks her tea on the sofa, it zooms out to reveal a wall with numerous guns hanging on it. She narrates that if the government knows about the chip, she must go to plan B, and that she'll assume that that is the only bad thing they know about. Pulling out some clothes and a passport from many, the Widow acknowledges that they did not find out about this on their own, and questions who told them and what is their reason, before coming to the conclusion it's a personal vendetta, while cutting open her hand slightly. She claims that the rose and the chip were two of her best kept secrets and everyone who knew about them are dead.</p><p>On the TV, a newscaster issue a report from the F.B.I. stating the there's a $1 million dollar reward for information on Natasha, and she claims that this was a predictable move but they are not her concern and she wants to know who's pulling their strings, while claiming that it's going to be a pleasurable hunt while preparing her weapons and passport.</p><p>Wolverine is say in Bucky Barnes' appartment and Wolvie asks him how the meeting went. Barnes knows Wolverine knows with Wolverine then asking how Pepper is. Barnes says she'll live, before asking why Logan let the Widow leave the hospital, to which he replies that at the time he knew nothing but he's researched and got told the Natasha is a spy too, but acknowledges that she wouldn't hire someone to shoot Pepper and comes to the conclusion that someone's after her.</p><p>He continues to narrate, saying that there'll be others and that the Widow needs to face them as the legend she is while Natasha is walking through a dock, claiming that she's close. She then turns, telling someone to reveal themselves. With this, Elektra does, telling the Widow that they need to talk, while Wolverine narrates, saying that legends always die hard.</p>",

They go to a martial arts demonstration featuring Shang Chi, where Midnight and a band of ninjas attack. Pete turns into Spider-Man and helps Shang-Chi defeat them.

Writer Mike Costa continues to put the fallen (now resurrected?!) Autobot through some strange paces, with stunning art by Casey Coller.</i> <i>   </i><br/> <br/>Ironhide finds himself at the racetracks of Cybertron which were famous long ago. As he stands there, he has memories of how the announcers said that all sentient life in the universe would focus on the races when they came on no matter what. Ironhide feels that everything other than himself is dead as he tries to open a door which has no power left. He then has a flashback from long ago when he worked as security for the racetrack in which Drag Strip was a racer entering the tracks and a bot tried to kill him but Ironhide stopped and arrested the bot. As the bot was arrested he told Ironhide that bots like him will be the cause of them losing everything. Then his boss came over and asked what was going on and Ironhide explained and also said that the bot was saying something about how he'd wake up one day and he and his boss laughed at this. Then it's back in the modern day and Ironhide is shocked by everything he sees. He describes the place like it was hit by a bomb and notices that radiation levels are also very high. He then starts feeling as though he's going crazy because he's talking to himself when he suddenly hears something moving and gains hope that there's someone else there. However, as he goes to where he heard the sounds coming from he finds nothing and really starts to doubt his sanity when all of a sudden he's attacked by a creature. He kills it but then gets attacked by another creature which he also kills while saying that this isn't the way it's supposed to be. He then transforms and drives away thinking to himself that someone else other than monsters and that everything can't just be dead when he crashes. He suddenly finds himself in a room with Ratchet and Wheeljack hovering above him telling him to get up. He's glad to see them and asks where everyone is and they say that they're at his funeral. He says that that can't be true because he's not dead when he suddenly sees the bot who he had arrested long ago at the racetrack half destroyed and the bot tells him that Prime isn't happy because he let the Stunticons get away. Ironhide says that he wasn't working for Prime at the time and then the bot tells him they're more dangerous now and he's lost his old job and no one recognizes him anymore. Ironhide then cries out that it can't be that no one recognizes him because he'd take a laser blast for any of his fellow bots and Prowl tells him that that's just stupid and it was a mistake and he ruined everything. Then Wheeljack appears and tells him that he also fixed everything. Ironhide is confused by this and then Wheeljack starts to get louder and louder and starts telling him that he must come now. Ironhide then wakes up and finds a bot standing in front of him telling him that he must come now and nothing else. He then transforms and follows the bot since there doesn't seem to be anything else to do. The bot just tells him to follow it and he just starts talking saying how he's glad that the bot isn't a monster and the place has changed a lot. He then tells the bot that he's just going to keep talking if it's alright with him because there's no one else there when they arrive at a part of Cybertron which is filled with lights and appears as though it may actually have living beings within.",

Set right at the start of the Crossed outbreak, this epic tale of depravity promises to shock and disturb you with even more intensity than the first series! The Pratt family was torn apart by the sudden strike of the infected masses. The survivors think they have found a safe place to start over. A place the Crossed won't find them and can be well defended. But those are only the external threat as evil lurks in the hearts of some men and those terrors aren't as easy to see as a Crossed rash. Imagine, for a moment, the worst crimes against humanity. Picture the cruelest affronts to decency. Conjure your darkest nightmares... and then realize it could all be so much worse. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed.</i></p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The first and fifth covers are a homage and a parody of Grant Wood's <em>American Gothic</em>.</li></ul>",

From the New York Times Best-selling author, George R. R. Martin, comes a tale of vampire clans, death and debauchery, legendary blood masters, and even a few epic steamboat races on the muddy Mississippi. This is Martin's FEVRE DREAM, an antebellum story of power, loss, and the fever of bloodlust. Marsh and York's beautiful riverboat, the Fever Dream, has already proved herself faster than the smaller boats on the river. But now she's going to face off against The Southerner, and that race won't be the only confrontation on the river when Marsh goes head to head with his co-captain! And what is the dark and brooding Damon Julian planning? There's snarling and dissent from his brood on the Garoux plantation that can only end in blood... but whose? Each issue of this stunning full-color epic is illustrated by Rafa Lopez, an artist whose skilled line captures every moonlit drop of blood in delicious detail. Adapted by the Hugo-nominated author Daniel Abraham, this version of FEVRE DREAM stays faithful to Martin's original dark vision, while bringing the torture and joy of his vampires to almost-human life.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The end is here. Sacrifices have been made. The most dangerous and successful attempt at the extermination of mutants is upon us. Who will walk away?</i></p><p><i><b>Synopsis for X-Men Second Coming Chapter 14:</b></i></p><p><i>Chapter 1</i></p><p>Everyone watches in amazement as Hope's floating body glows in a fiery aura. As she lands back onto the ground, she stumbles and staggers towards Cable dismembered arm; clutching onto it as she calls his name and passes out.</p><p>In the infirmary, Hank is seen treating Piotr's wounds from the battle. A dazed Hope awakens to find herself in the infirmary and Hank comes over to examine her once he sees that she is conscious. Hope asks how long she has been out since then and Hank replies for \"around thirty hours\". Hank tells Hope that she seems to be fine and apologizes for his abruptness to leave her for he is needed to help treat the injuries of the other patients in the infirmary. Hank joins Doctor Nemesis in examining Warren's injured wings, while Doctor Rao checks up on Bobby, and Karma is seen being fitted for a new prosthetic leg. As Hope stands idle looking around at the injured, Erik tells Hope that it has been much less than a week. Hope seems puzzled by Erik, and he reminds her of what she had told him before and what she had done to Bastion. Hope says she does not exactly remember what has happened recently or what she had done and asks him if everyone around her thinks she's dangerous. Julian interrupts sarcastically saying who would think that she's dangerous as he waves his severed arms around. Erik quickly rebuffs Julian and tells him to run along and get back to rest. Erik tells Hope not to worry herself over what the others think as Hope lies down on the gurney next to Erik. She tells him that maybe it is alright to be thought of as dangerous.</p><p><i>Chapter 2</i></p><p>Hope has a flashback of Nathan telling her that she isn't gonna get rid of him that easy, and back in the present Hope and many of the other X-Men are attending the funeral service for him. As Scott tries to give a eulogy for his son, he is overwhelmed at the situation and is unable to do so. Hope sees this and steps up to speak for Nathan in his place; giving a tearful speech. After the funeral service Hope sits alone by herself near the coast. Loa, Bling and Prodigy watch Hope from afar and ponder if they should say anything to her, but Prodigy deduces that anything they have to say to her she already knows.</p><p>Scott pulls Rogue aside much to her dismay so they could have their talk. Scott tells Rogue that her actions and choices could have made Kurt and Nathan's deaths been in vain because she put Hope in the front lines and thus in danger. Rogue tells Scott that Hope wants to fight in the front lines alongside with the people that are putting their lives in danger for her and not to hide behind them. Scott tells her that her decision put their whole strategy plan in jeopardy, and is disappointed that she made that decision alone. He tells her that because Hope trusts and responds to her that she is needed on Utopia to help her cope with everything going on, but adds that she is reckless and a loose cannon and officially takes her off the combat roster.</p><p><i>Chapter 3</i></p><p>Logan is alone binge drinking as Ororo enters. He tells her to leave and she tells him she cannot and asks him what's wrong instead. He tells her that Kurt was the only X-Men that did not see him as an animal, but Kurt died seeing exactly that; an animal. Ororo asks him if Kurt was wrong, to which he simply responds no. Ororo mentions that she spoke to Scott about the secret formation of X-Force and that Scott told her that he accepts full responsibility for X-Force. Ororo looks at an old picture of herself, Scott, Jean, Kurt and Logan and reminisces of the past. She picks up the picture frame and tells Logan that she is taking it and that he may kill her if he does not like it because that is what he does now. Logan tries to explain his involvement in X-Force and rationalizes their actions and choices. Ororo saddened by his views says that she is sorry to hear that he felt that way because now this might be the last time that they are able to drink together.</p><p>Later, Logan approaches Laura and tells her that she's out. Confused, Laura replies that she does not understand what he means. Logan continues and tells her that it is over and that she is no longer in X-Force. Laura tells him that Cyclops ordered her to be in X-Force, but Logan replies that he should have never let Laura onto the team roster. He adds that both he and Cyclops used her just like how the Weapon X Facility would use her, and that it is time for her to act as her own person and make her own decisions. He asks her what does she want, still bewildered she replies that she doesn't understand. Logan continues to badger Laura on the subject and she simply replies that she does not know exactly what she wants. As Logan begin to turn and walk away from her, he tells her that it is a start and if she wants orders that she should give them to herself and he leaves her.</p><p>On Alcatraz, Scott tells Logan that numerous X-Men including Storm, Colossus, Iceman, Xavier, etc. have come to him about the underhanded formation of X-Force, and that Hank will not be returning. Scott continues on and tells Logan that X-Force will no longer be a part of the X-Men's future. Logan agrees more or less and tells Scott to get some rest because he looks exhausted and leaves. Logan walks into a darkened room and announces that this is now X-Force and that no one can ever know about them. Fantomex, Angel, Psylocke and Deadpool all stand beside Logan.</p><p><i>Chapter 4</i></p><p>Scott is alone preparing a letter to Kurt's sister to inform him of his death when Bobby comes in to inform him of Hanks departure. Hank and Namor are seen in the hangar(?) and they have a small chat. Hank wonders why Namor would take residence on the mutant isle of Utopia while Namor wonders what kind of man would turn his back on his own people. As Hank's aircraft takes off, Namor states that they are better off without him. After watching Hank leave, Scott leaves to find Emma and to check on Hope. Scott spots Emma at the bonfire and asks why she is in diamond form, and she responds that she is tired of feeling. Scott then asks Emma how is Hope doing to which she replies not so great considering her father is dead and everyone around her hates her. Scott then asks Emma if what they did was right and she says it does not matter, that what matters is tomorrow. Hope glances back at Emma and a phoenix like aura envelopes around Hope. A stunned Emma rushes to find Scott to tell him of what she saw, but when she finds him he tells her to quiet down. As five lights appear on cerebra, Scott tells Emma that they were right.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The battle for New York begins as battle lines are drawn and war forges strange allies. Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Spider-Man, Moon Knight and...Kingpin?! Plus, a dangerous new player enters the battle, one that could win the fight...or damn all of New York!</em></p><p>The second installment of Shadowland opens in Hell's Kitchen. The events of the previous issue are covered. A lone undercover cop remarks to himself about what Daredevil has done. He recalls the construction of Shadowland, the Hand ninjas patrolling the streets and in search of some of his fellow officers who are missing. He shatters the glass in his own taxi and the Hand ninjas are instantly on the scene.</p><p>Next, we head to a soup kitchen owned by Danny Rand. He and Luke Cage are discussing the actions of Daredevil and whether or not Bullseye deserved what he got. Cage calls it murder while Rand attempting to remain optimistic says you could say it was self defense. Cage disagrees saying Murdock's actions are only bringing fear to Hell's Kitchen and he breaks up a scuffle in the soup kitchen.</p><p>The Kingpin and Lady Bullseye enter the soup kitchen. Fisk says he wants to return Hell's Kitchen to legitimate authority and Luke &amp; Danny scoff at his \"noble\" intentions. Fisk reiterates Cage's statement about fear ruling the streets and says they're going to have to take down Daredevil.</p><p>The story moves to Daredevil's throne room in Shadowland. Black tarantula approaches him and says wallowing in guilt isn't necessary. Daredevil says he feels no guilt or anything. Black Tarantula asks him what he needs and Daredevil says they need reinforcements. They need to expand their area of control and Black Tarantula questions the entire martial law governing Hell's Kitchen. Daredevil says he expects him to follow his orders without question. He is to invite all costumed heroes to join the Hand or become their enemies.</p><p>Back to Midtown. Kingpin and Lady Bullseye are apparently taking part in a mystical ritual. There is a pentagram shaped object on the floor and the Kingpin has an ancient scroll in his hand. Lady Bullseye says she had to slay many hand ninjas to obtain it. Kingpin says that the ritual has been prepared and all that remains is the final incantation. This will summon the Zugaikotsu warrior. Lady Bullseye says he is one of the Hand's most ancient enemies and should be feared. She says he seeks to control him like a child's plaything. Fisk says all men must bend to his wield and the ancient warrior was a man once.</p><p>Fisk utters the incantation in Japanese and Lady Bullseye questions if anything happened or not. Fisk says he can hear it and its getting closer. He says she may wish to duck as something crashes through a nearby window. Fisk is shocked and Lady Bullseye says not to look at it's eyes. The demon asks, \"What the hell is this?\" Fisk says, \"Oh ancient one, hear me now. A great injustice has been done in the city. Voices cry out in darkness.\" The demon cuts him off and says \"You may cut the masterpiece theater talk fat man. Voices crying out for what?\" Fisk simply replies...\"What else? Vengeance.\"</p><p>Once again we go back to Shadowland. White Tiger with Hand ninjas confronts Luke cage, Iron Fist, Shang Chi, Misty Knight &amp; Colleen Wing. She says that Daredevil sees no one and Shadowland is off limits to civilians. Then we go back to Daredevil's throne room. Daredevil assumes they've reconsidered his offer. The group of heroes says they just wanted to talk. Murdock says there is nothing to discuss and the other heroes argue with him over his recent tactics. At this moment Spider Man enters the throne room from a nearby window.</p><p>Finally we go to the Shadowland dungeon. The cop from the first part of the issue is behind bars with some of his fellow officers. They discuss the rumors swirling regarding Shadowland. The officer regurgitates a lock pick and escapes his cell. He decides to check out the layout of the prison before freeing anyone else. As he looks around they hear a rumble. One of the officers says it sounds like a dinosaur. \"Worse\" says the cop. Ghost Rider has entered Shadowland. He easily dispatches some of the Hand ninjas with Hellfire. Laughing hysterically he races upward.</p><p>Finally, Daredevil is notified they've been breached. Daredevil blames it on Iron Fist, Luke Cage and friends. He says he knew they couldn't be trusted. He orders the Hand to take them down. This issue closes with Cage, Iron Fist, Shang Chi, Spider-Man, Colleen Wing and Misty Knight throwing down with DD, Black Tarantula, White Tiger and Hand ninjas....</p>",

Come along and join  Black Bolt, Medusa, Triton, Gorgon, Karnak and loveable Lockjaw, as they  struggle in battle against both Kree and Skrull in The War of the Three  Galaxies!</i> <p><i>It all begins when Blastaar bursts into the Inhumans' Himalayan  refuge to activate an ancient menace designed to devour the entire  Inhuman race. That Kree monster is just the first salvo in a war that  will lead the Royal Family to the stars and into battle side by side  with Captain Marvel. And if cosmos-spanning war isn't enough to keep  Black Bolt and company busy, the insane Maximus can always be relied  upon to wreak havoc ­ and then only to whet the appetite for the coming  of the Incredible Hulk! Illustrated by the king of detail-packed  penciling George Perez, master of amazing anatomy Gil Kane, and 1970s  up-and-comer Keith Pollard, with scripts by the fan-favourite writer  that crafted many of the era's greatest epics, Doug Moench, it's a  singular saga that's collected here for the very first time!</i></p> <i> Collecting <em>The Inhumans</em> issues #1 to 12, <em>Captain Marvel</em> #52 and 53 and the rare Inhumans tales from <em>What If...?</em> #29 and 30 and <em>Thor Annual</em>  #12, written by Doug Moench and Scott Edelman, pencilled by George  Perez, Gil Kane, Keith Pollard and Al Milgrom, with cover artwork by Gil  Kane..</i>",

All this, and the secret manipulator behind the scenes twists his knife in Steve's back with an ending that will leave readers stunned!</i></p><p>Shot by a sniper, Jacob Erskine urges Steve Rogers to protect his wife because “if Smith’s done it”, “they’ll come after her now”. Erskine dies and Rogers escapes the hotel. Once on the ground, he sees a sniper’s nest, but he finds it was controlled remotely by computer. Rogers scours the Madripoor underworld for intel on who may have hired a hitman to kill Erskine. No one has info, and Rogers suspects it was an inside job.</p><p>Rogers asks Sharon Carter to gather info on Myron Smith, Erskine’s head of security. Rogers then recalls the woman who looks like Erskine’s wife, Anita. Lieutenant Cynthia Glass worked on the Super-Soldier experiment, ended up being a Nazi spy, but also died saving Rogers against orders from her superiors. Rogers tails Smith and Anita to Nextin Pharmaceuticals’ corporate retreat. Rogers confronts Anita while she walks on the beach and she seems to remember Rogers. Carter calls Rogers with info on Smith, who has no personal history at all prior to joining Nextin. Rogers figures out the puzzle – Anita Erskine and Myron Smith are machines controlled by the Machinesmith. Machinesmith then begins to deactivate the super-soldier serum in Rogers’ blood and Rogers begins to shrink.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The creative team of</i> <i>Jonathan Maberry and</i> <i>Goran Parlov take you on a journey into the darkest territory in this Marvel Knights limited series. A terrible plague has swept the Earth, turning everyone - human, hero, villain, god and monster - into sadistic cannibal predators. As Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Thing and other infected start a feeding frenzy, the world falls in a wave of insatiable violence. Now, five years later, one man hunts the wasteland that was New York City. One man stands against the hordes of monsters who hunt the night. He is the Punisher, the Last Gun on Earth. And he has an endless supply of ammunition.</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>New York was infected with a disease that limited peoples' higher brain functions which reduced everyone to cannibals. Everyone except for the Punisher. He was forced to hunt the infected and was on the trail of the Hulk. He shot the Hulk in the eye with an arrow made of a broken piece of Wolverine's claw. The Hulk collapsed and Punisher seized the opportunity to kill the incredible Hulk.</p><p>In the distance the Punisher could hear cries for help. Upon further investigation, he discovered two survivors in a church trapped in a pit. As Punisher lowered a rope to rescue a clergyman &amp; a young boy, Venom ambushed the Punisher. He managed to kill Venom and pull the two out of the pit before more infected within the church could stop him.</p><p>Along the way back to Punisher's hideout the preacher explained he had been trying to help those not infected but, everyday more and more people turn and become cannibals. He thanked God for answering his prayers and sending the Punisher to come rescue him, but Punisher did not share his belief in God and sees their timely rescue as a coincidence or luck. The pastor explained that he has not lost his faith in God despite the all that has happened. He saw irrevocable proof of hell all around him and conversely knows if Hell exists than Heaven must also exist.</p><p>At the Punisher's hideout Deadpool called out Punisher wanting to talk. The Punisher shot Deadpool several times before tying him up. Deadpool told him there were more survivors, and that his boss would like to talk with Punisher. The Punisher left Deadpool with a necklace made of hand grenades around his neck and went back inside the hideout to find Spider-Man (Deadpool's boss) holding the priest and the boy.</p>",

Is Daredevil using The Hand to kill mobsters untouchable by the law? Or is something even more sinister spreading throughout the city? Each hero approaches the puzzle from a different angle, and now they must race to discover the truth - but The Hand has other ideas, and time is running out! Can this quartet of strange bedfellows put their differences aside and come together before death strikes again? Join writer Antony Johnston (DAREDEVIL) and artist Wellinton Alves (THUNDERBOLTS) for a trip down the mean streets of Shadowland!</i></p><p>Paladin, thinking he shot and injured Shroud at the conclusion of last issue, is fooled by the Shroud who was faking injury. After a short fight, they stop and begin to sort out their stories. Paladin had been hired by Mikey Fortunado (found dead last issue) to kill his brother, Bobby. After Mikey wound up dead, Paladin assumed that Bobby was responsible and went to rob him to recover his fee when he ambushed the Shroud, who had been observing Bobby’s apartment. The Shroud tells Paladin that the Hand was responsible for Mikey’s death, but Paladin is unconvinced that Daredevil would have bothered to have Mikey killed.</p><p>Misty Knight cons her way into the office of the Chief Medical Examiner and examines Mikey Fortunado’s body while another technician is in the morgue with her. Knight finds that Mikey had rohypnol is his blood and observes that his wounds were too sloppy to have been caused by the Hand. Later, the Hand show up in Misty’s office and tell her they did not kill Mikey Fortunado and tell Misty to stop her investigation. Misty calls Bobby Fortunado and tells him he may be in danger. As he talks to Misty, Bobby sees Hand ninjas in his apartment.</p><p>Silver Sable calls her employer to ask about her fee. Her employer states that the job was to bring back her target alive, which she did not do, and he then implies that Sable killed him intentionally, which would harm her reputation. She vows to find who killed her target.</p><p>At Bobby Fortunado’s apartment, Paladin arrives to find Bobby and his men dead. Misty arrives and thinks Paladin killed Bobby. He denies it as more of Bobby’s men show up. They assume Misty and Paladin killed Bobby and train their guns on them.</p>",

Who is the kid that can mop the floor with them both? And if that wasn't bad enough, the worst villains from Luke and Danny's past are crawling out of the woodwork en masse to take them on: Cockroach Hamilton! Comanche! Specs! Senor Muerte! Discuss! Stiletto! Why has this flash mob of colorful criminality suddenly swarmed against our heroes -- and what role does it play in the long-term schemes of The Hand?</i></p><p>AThe book opens with another flashback as Victor Alvarez argues with his father over his parent’s impending divorce. Just as Victor accuses his father of caring about the protest for the apartment building more than his family, the building blows up (due to Bullseye).</p><p>In present day, Victor’s mother comes to talk to him, but realizes he has snuck out. Picking up on the fight from last issue, the new Power Man continues to take on Luke Cage and Iron Fist. A nearby drug dealer recognizes Power Man as the one who took out his crew early last issue. He calls someone he refers to as “D.N.S.”, who summons the Rivals. The fight continues as Power Man absorbs the chi from Iron Fist’s signature punch, much to the surprise of Iron Fist. The Rivals arrive and take on a drained Power Man. Cage and Iron Fist join the fight and beat up several of the Rivals. They are briefly detained by Chemistro’s alchemy gun which allows Power Man to leave the scene. We learn that Power Man is the son of the former Rival member Shades. Cage and Iron Fist can’t pursue him any longer as they must get to Shadowland for Daredevil’s intervention ( <a data-ref-id=\"4000-227712\" href=\"/shadowland-/4000-227712/\">SL #2</a>). During the ensuing Shadowland melee, Daredevil removes the ban on killing, prompting the ninjas who were beaten by Power Man (last issue) to plan their revenge.</p><p>At home, Power Man/Victor reveals to his stepsister Sofia that he is Power Man. He confesses to her that he has no idea how he survived the apartment explosion and that he has intense dreams that seem like memories. He makes Sofia promise to keep his secret. His mother then barges in and Sofia tells her Victor was jumped by the Rivals and his mom believes her.</p><p>On Riker’s Island, a voice in a limo talks to a lawyer who tells her that half the Rivals will be released from jail and the other half will have to stay due to warrants. The voice turns out to be Deadly Nightshade (“D.N.S.”), who is in pursuit of Power Man for an item that “Specs” stole from her months ago.</p>",

From the award-winning master of comics, Alan Moore, comes a brand new tale of Lovecraftian horror that will leave you too afraid to close your eyes, but more afraid to open them! NEONOMICON, the sequel to THE COURTYARD Graphic Novel, is slithering its way onto shelves to take its place as a Great Old One of comics terror! Illustrated by Moore's favorite demented artist, Jacen Burrows, NEONOMICON pulls no punches as every full-colored page is covered in nightmares brought to gruesome life! In the wake of a gruesome homicide and an impossible vision in the courtyard, Agents Brears and Lamper are understandably rattled, but more determined than ever to find answers. Now, their case is taking them literally and literarily through Lovecraftian mythos, to Salem, Massachusetts as they try to unravel the secrets of sex, drugs, murder, and the ever-creeping darkness...</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>On a bitter winter day,</i> <i>Kinsey Locke</i> encounters a madwoman who just might be able to unlock the darkest secrets of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55977\" href=\"/keyhouse/4020-55977/\"><i>Keyhouse</i></a>, but forcing the truth out of her won't be easy, and besides... <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52416\" href=\"/lucas-caravaggio/4005-52416/\"><i>Dodge</i></a> has no intention of ever giving Erin Voss a chance to tell what she knows...</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>The issue starts with two men shoveling snow off the side walk. One is making racist comments about President Obama as a black woman pushes another black woman in a wheelchair. As <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52411\" href=\"/tyler-locke/4005-52411/\">Tyler</a>, Kinsey, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59946\" href=\"/jordan-gates/4005-59946/\">Jordan</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52416\" href=\"/lucas-caravaggio/4005-52416/\">Zach</a> walk by, the woman in the wheelchair starts to scream the names Dodge and Rendell at them. The two women continue into a gated residence and the woman pushing reveals that the woman in the wheelchair is Erin Voss. Remembering the name, Kinsey implores Mrs. Voss for information about Keyhouse and her father. Mrs. Voss simply yells back \"No! White! White! WHITE!\" Kinsey wonders why Erin is scared until the man who was shoveling snow points out that the residence is McClellan Psychiatric Hospital. Kinsey wants to seek answers from Erin but Tyler simply wants life to be normal.</p><p>Kinsey is back at Keyhouse with Scott and Jamal, remembering Erin's name being on the wall in the drowning cave, while through the door <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52413\" href=\"/bode-locke/4005-52413/\">Bode</a> is eavesdropping. Kinsey is astounded that Erin acted that way just because she was white, citing that Erin was friends with her father. She wonders how to get in when Jamal mentions that it isn't difficult to get in and that his uncle used to work there until racism forced him to quit. Kinsey decides that she'll go Saturday. Scott points out that the problem isn't getting in, the problem is she's still white.</p><p>The two men who were shoveling snow are now in the bar when Zach, who has used the gender key to become a girl, approaches them. Zach asks them about McClellan and then tells them a story about how she bet someone Erin Voss was in there. As proof she asks them to take a picture of Erin and specifies that the picture must include the door to her room. The man answers that Zach can expect the pictures on Saturday.</p><p>Bode is standing before Kinsey with something held behind his back. Bode reveals that he can fix it so that Erin will talk to her, but only if Kinsey and Tyler start including him when making plans. Kinsey asks how he is going to help her talk to Erin when he pulls a mirror from behind his back. The mirror enables a person looking into it to take on the appearance of another ethnicity.</p><p>Kinsey and Bode, both now black, are sitting across from a black boy on a bus. Kinsey comments on how a woman won't sit down, even though there is an empty seat. Bode remarks that maybe she's getting off at the next stop, which she does. Kinsey wonders if it really mattered why she wouldn't sit, that \"Maybe it just sucks not knowing.\" The boy sitting across from them states that \"<b>Mostly</b> it just sucks not knowing.\"</p><p>Kinsey and Bode arrive at McClellan as the photo that Zach requested is being taken. One of the snow shoveling guys enters Erin's room to take more photos as the other guards the door. As the man shuts the door to Erin's room a disguised and knife-wielding Zach uses the Anywhere Key to enter. Zach kills the man in the room and Erin begins to scream, alerting the man outside. He enters, sees Zach and flees to the room across the hall, with Zach in pursuit. Kinsey enters Erin's room. Not noticing the body hidden behind her, she uses the Head Key to peer into Erin's mind, to find only white walls with Rendell written on one wall with a valentine's heart picture of him, and scrawled on the other wall is Dodge and the Omega Key. In the foreground of her mind is Kinsey opening Erin's head and a masked man holding two knives over a body on a bed. Kinsey realizes that Erin's thoughts quickly fade away and that what is in her mind is the present. She turns to see the body as a nurse comes and she runs from the room.</p><p>Back at Keyhouse, as the television shows news of racial prejudice, Kinsey relates to Tyler how Bode and she could not hail a cab until they had become white again. Tyler says that at least the authorities are not looking for Kinsey, to which Kinsey doesn't know how to feel. The final segment on the news is the search for \"an African-American, in her teens or early twenties.\"</p>",

Just as young Lieutenant  Thomas Brightwater meets Doe in a remote and secret outpost at the edge  of desert and gets a brief glimpse of his dark backstory, the terrifying  being breaks free and havoc is unleashed. Meanwhile, armed with what  they do know as well as a regional conflict in the Middle East quickly  spinning out of control, higher ups in Washington mobilize a twisted  plan to ensnare the whole region in a final and decisive battle royal.  Or so they think. Because they could have never predicted how the  biggest menace of all is of their own ilk and with the potential to  terrorize their forces in a way no terrorist ever could. For Lieutenant  Brightwater, the race is on to once more gain control over Doe,  understand his unfathomable origins, and possibly get him back on the  cause. The alternative is total Armageddon - not just in the region, but  possibly the whole planet and everyone on it...</i>",

For centuries, the God of Mischief endured righteous punishment for his many crimes, and yet blamed his hated half-brother for his own torment. Learning of the Odinson's awakening, the God of Lies engineers his escape, to wreak havoc and nightmare upon those whom Dr. Donald Blake loves! Meanwhile, when Heimdall attempts to block an angry Thor from regaining entry to Asgard, we discover if his sword is a match for the power of the mighty hammer Mjolnir! The legend reborn continues with Harvey Award-winning writer Bryan J.L. Glass (The Mice Templar) and acclaimed artist Tan Eng Huat (SILVER SURFER: IN THY NAME)!</i></p>",

But with their troop numbers spread impossibly thin from both war-time service and riot control, the National Guard know that one misstep in dealing with the protesters could set off a fatal firestorm of violence during this most emotional time...

Funny thing is, he was hiding in plain sight there in the glare of the white hot lights, a lanky stranger with the rubber arm, throwing heat that could take off a man’s head. See, every man needs a challenge, a moment when he faces impossible odds, when looks deep inside himself and sees what he’s really made of. Bullseye’s next pitch is one for the history books.</p>",

Mitsu has just started working as a window washer, a dangerous job that five years earlier led to the loss of his father. As Mitsu struggles with being the new guy--making mistakes, struggling to keep up, handling petty workplace resentments--he also discovers the simple pleasures of befriending his coworkers, enjoying time off and getting to know his absent father through the eyes of his colleagues. All of this is part of growing up in the cramped urban quarters of the Saturn Apartments.</i>",

With the aid (and occasional interference) of a few of the Phantomhive house's numerous acquaintances, little stands in the way of the young earl getting to the bottom of this mystery.

A satirical and funny sendup of the monster craze of the 1960s, Melvin Monster is a classic kids comic of the Silver Age. Stanley's reputation as a great storyteller and visual comedian is richly deserved - few golden or silver-age comics stand the test of time the way these comics do. As with all volumes in the John Stanley Library (Nancy, Thirteen Going on Eighteen), covers and interiors are designed by the award-winning cartoonist Seth, who is the designer of the bestselling Peanuts archival collection.</em></p>",

Realistic in its visual execution and noble in its subject, depicting a time in which the fabled warriors of history and legends fought together for the greater good, it remains one of the great masterpieces of the medium.</i></p><p><i>In this second volume, Prince Valiant helps his father reclaim his throne in the kingdom of Thule, fights alongside King Arthur, and is made a knight of the Round Table in recompense for his bravery and wit. Bored by the peace he helped to create, Val decides to independently pull together the forces to battle the Huns’ descent on Southern Europe. When Val’s army breaches the Huns’ stronghold, however, he discovers that corruption reigns still further west in Rome. Thus Val sets off with Sir Gawain and Tristam of Arthurian legend fame, and the familial kinship of the trio sees them through chivalrous escapades, false imprisonment and daring escapes. By the end of this volume, they go their separate ways, and Val boards a ship to Sicily—yet a storm approaches, throwing him off-course, as adventure follows him everywhere.</i></p><p><i>Fantagraphics is proud to present these strips, which, thanks to the use of original proof sheets and advances in printing technology, are even brighter and crisper than when they were originally published 70 years ago.

            "description": "<p><em>Loosely based on a teenager’s diary from the 1980s found in a gas-station bathroom,<strong>Unlovable</strong> is the remarkable story of Tammy Pierce, as filtered through the pen of Los Angeles artist Esther Pearl Watson. This second volume picks up where the first volume left off (winter break) and finishes Tammy’s tragicomic sophomore year of high school in 1985.</em></p><p><em>Tammy has built a devoted following over the last several years in the pages of <strong>Bust</strong> magazine, where <strong>Unlovable</strong> continues to be serialized on the magazine’s back page, and this beautifully produced, dayglo-orange and sparkly pink hardcover presents over 400 pages of her sometimes ordinary, sometimes humiliating, often poignant and always hilarious exploits. Her hopes, dreams, agonies and defeats are brought to vivid, comedic life by Watson’s lovingly grotesque drawings, filled with all the ’80s essentials — too much mascara, leg warmers with heels and huge hair, etc. — as well as timeless teen concerns like acne, dandruff, and the opposite sex (or same sex, in some cases).</em></p><p><em><strong>Unlovable</strong> is about the rawness of trying to figure out who you are in a very public and humiliating way. <strong>Unlovable</strong> addresses these mysteries of adolescence through Tammy’s naiveté; girls and women in particular will find much that resonates, but men will also relate to <strong>Unlovable</strong>’s universal humor and wide cast of characters.</em></p><p><em>In the epic saga that is <strong>Unlovable</strong>, Tammy finds herself dealing with: tampons, teasing, crushes, The Smiths, tube socks, facial hair, lice, celibacy, fantasy dream proms, gym showers, skid marks, a secret admirer, prank calls, backstabbers, winter ball, barfing, narcs, breakdancing, hot wheels, glamour shots, roller coasters, Halloween costumes, boogers, boys, boy crazy feelings, biker babes, and even some butt cracks. Tammy’s life isn’t pretty, but it is endlessly charming and hilarious.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>L'attaque au Metropolitan Museum of art de New York par des chevaliers templiers en arme a marqué tous les esprits. Les trésors du Vatican qui étaient au coeur d'une exposition semblent être l'enjeu de l'attaque, et notamment cet objet des Templiers, l'étrange encodeur qui permettrait de déchiffrer des informations fondamentales... L'agent Reilly mène l'enquête, aidé par le Vatican mais leur émissaire, monseigneur de Angelis, joue un double jeu et est prêt à tout que certaines informations demeurent définitivement secrètes. Pendant ce temps Tess progresse dans ses recherches qu'elle partage avec Reilly à propos de ces mystérieux Templiers... Le second tome de cette série passionnante qui a rencontré un vif succès dès sa sortie !</em></p>",
