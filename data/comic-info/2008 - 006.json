Who?!!</em></p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p>Horn sits with Haley as she watches Madman and the Atomics on their mission. He tells her not to kid herself since he has a girlfriend. She insists that she is only concerned about the mission and saving the Universe.</p><p>The team stands in front of the Crimson King. He congratulates and absorbs his son. They try standing up him. Tired of their complaining, the Crimson King starts blasting them away into nothingness with Frank the first to go. The Crimson King is ready to remake the Universe.</p><p>Madman and the Atomics now find themselves far outside of the Crimson King's lair. Confused, Madman tells them that he got into his head and made him think he destroyed all of them. Madman tells them they have to stop him because he basically wants to do the Big Bang in reverse.</p><p>As if things weren't bad enough, they get attacked by brain eaters. In a courageous move, Metalman becomes a victim. Hale tells them his brain is gone but his body could be preserved. It Girl is shocked by this. Frank tries telling her they have to carry on. He pulls her to him and asks to feel her pain and he'll show her all that he knows. As they merge, she becomes enlightened.</p><p>They join together, willing to die as heroes in order to save the Universe. They succeed and return to Haley. As thanks, she says she sent engineers from her planet to Earth to build a base with some of their technology to help them in fighting the good fight. Frank's rocket has also been fixed and modified so that it is easier to navigate. Frank is given a new spacesuit and It Girl is given a re-animated Metalman. Haley is confused at her distress. She figured they'd want to use him as a Zom-bot. Next is the arrival of Joe. Haley figured Frank would want to celebrate with her there and she is being brought in a sphere. As she approaches, Frank realizes that he's having deja vu. This is when she dies. It Girl stretches out her arms to save her. Haley stops her saying she'll be killed too. With an explosion, Joe is gone.</p><p>Haley tries apologizing. Frank just takes the spacesuit and leaves in the rocket. The rest of the Atomics are left not knowing what they'll do next.</p>",

Dinah tells Ollie that she'll drive and asks Ollie if he's going to make himself useful. Ollie pulls out his bow and arrow, and shoots the aircraft that attacked them. However, it turns out to be an arrow that releases glue on impact, so he grabs a few other arrows and shoots for the aircraft.

And the truth behind the origin of underground secret agent Rockman!</p><p>Spoilers</p><p>The Laughing Mask is brought in to police custody. Even though it's been noted that he might need to be placed separate from the normal prison population, he is placed in a cell with other inmates.</p><p>Black Widow continues her nightly excursions to the Goth clubs. There is a young woman that is interested in her and looks up to her. She wants to know where she always disappears to at midnight. Black Widow says it'd be better if she didn't know where she went or what she did.</p><p>Phantom Reporter has a bit of writer's block. He contemplates putting on the old costume when he receives a phone call from Mastermind Excello. He tells Richard that now that he's secluded himself, he is starting to see the flow of time again. Something terrible is going to happen.</p><p>Dynamic Man continues his fight against evil. He easily takes out the \"Men of Tomorrow\" in their giant mechanical robots. A group of men want to buy him a drink to thank him. He finally agrees to let them. In the bar, one man pats his behind which angers him to no end.</p><p>Captain Wonder is out saving lives too but is not speaking to anyone. It's clear that he is still grieving.</p><p>Colonel Dexter gets a visit from a young woman who thinks that Rockman might be her grand-uncle, Daniel. Her grandmother told her he was trying to unionize the men in his mining town against the company that owned it all. The owner finally brought in some men to kill him. Winning the fight, the owner set off an explosion that accidentally killed everyone below. Daniel was exposed to some gas that made him invulnerable. When he dug his way out, he discovered that the entire town fell into a sinkhole. All were dead, including his wife and daughter. He would pound on the ground and claim that he could hear them calling him from below. The Colonel told her it wasn't Rockman when she showed him an old photograph. He later said it would be better for him this way rather than know that he would never see his wife and daughter again.</p><p>In the end, the Phantom Reporter decides to make a comeback.</p>",

After a fiasco in the Danger Room, the girls fight over Colossus, and they smash the TV, so they have to face Wolverine in a real berseker rage!</em></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>It's the last night of a visit from Banshee and Moira MacTaggart and the X-Men are going out to a dinner and show. The seventh game of the Stanley Cup means that Logan is left home to babysit Siryn, Kitty, Amp, and Illyana. Before leaving, Colossus gives Siryn a note. Kitty wonders what's up since she has a crush on him.</p><p>The girls are bored and Siryn proposes they all check out the Danger Room. Kitty has reservations, but she casts them aside when she thinks of Siryn laughing about Kitty's immaturity with Colossus. Kitty opens the Danger Room and the ladies access the earliest program available: a Brotherhood of Evil Mutants simulation. Amp runs away with Illyana while Kitty and Siryn take on the robots. During the fight, Kitty asks about the note from Colossus. Siryn doesn't really answer, causing Kitty to stew even more in her rising jealousy. The fight ends when Illyana inadvertently opens a portal into the control room and hits the pause button. The girls leave the Danger while Logan continues watching his game.</p><p>The go to Kitty's room and play a game in which they tell secrets to each other. Kitty has to go first and she tells Amp about her fears concerning Siryn stealing Colossus from her. Amp tries to ease her mind by telling Kitty about a guy back at Muir that Siryn likes. Meanwhile, the robots un-pause and begin scanning the mansion for enemies to engage.</p><p>Illyana's turn in the closet has her trying to tell Kitty that she teleported through a wall. Kitty doesn't get it. The robots from the Danger Room have found Logan. Big mistake: they block the television. He dispatches the robots and returns to his \"moral right as a Canadian.\"</p><p>Amp's turn in the closet reveals that she has a crush on a guy back on Muir Island named Dmitri. Siryn, however, bursts her bubble and reveals that she and Dmitri are fooling around. As a matter of fact, the cryptic note Colossus gave Siryn is a note to Dmitri in Russian. Amp is offended and tells Siryn that Kitty played a joke and had Colossus write a mean letter about Siryn instead. Then, using her emotion-boosting powers, turns Siryn onto Kitty. The ladies blast through a wall and crush Logan's television. Logan goes berserk and chases the girls around the house. Amp calms him down with her powers and then admits what she did. Logan has compassion on Amp and offers her some kind words.</p><p>When the X-Men return home, they find Logan cradling Amp on the sofa. Later, on the flight back to Muir, Amp and Siryn make up and Amp admits to forsaking Dmitri. She's got Logan on her mind.</p>",

Stark Industries is beset on all sides by the evil Ezekiel Stane and his hordes of suicide bombers around the world. Can Iron Man be in four places at once while his empire crumbles?</i></p><p>Is this the day the Man of Iron finally meets his match? The answer....maybe so. Tony sends his Iron Men to disable the bombers, he doesn't want a body count. But the bombers are still set in their mind their the martyrs and Stane is the man who will lead them. Tony improvises his fight with Stane bringing in more Iron Man armors to his fight in attempts to distract Stane long enough and give him an advantage. Soon Tony must take it into his own iron cold hands to defeat this man, but as he knew it would happen the bombers set off the bombs within their suits and three go off leveling cities.</p><p>His fight with Stane is a trying one will he make the killshot or will he not. Soon he makes the decision that affects the entire globe, the world without electricity. Trillions lost for one pathetic excuse for a child....Tony is angry and he makes the final showdown between his long time nemesis son a good one making Stane see what he has done. The world will not be the same, and Tony will never be the same again once he sees what he must do to stop this from ever happening again.</p>",
