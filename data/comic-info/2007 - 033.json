            "description": "<p> <br/><em>Mark Verheiden <i> (</i>Battlestar Galactica, Smallville) brings you the conclusion of the epic story pitting DCU aliens against the Earth. You won't believe who the Last Son of Krypton and the Dark Knight must face in this finale!</em>    <br/> <br/>Across the world, the blackrocks fall affecting all those that come in contact with them. Batman continues to be infected, himself, fighting against Superman. Superman tries to get through to him as he takes the punches from Batman. He knows that the blackrock will release Batman if it believes it is in danger but it also knows that Superman will not kill Batman. Superman makes it clear that he does know how Batman's mind works and that he'd rather die than lose his soul. As he starts hitting back, he says he will do whatever it takes to bring him back or give him peace. The blackrock appears to believe him as it leaves Batman's body.</p> <p>An infected Jimmy visits Lex Luthor. It seems the \"others\" want Lex but with a clear mind. They do not wish him to be infected. As he's about to be taken, he tries to bargain for his life by saying he knows how to deal with Superman, how his type think. He is soon surprised to see that Despero is also working with the others. He tells Lex that if he tells him how to kill Superman, they may let him live.</p> <p>Superman and Batman regroup to prepare for a final battle. They pick up a nuclear device that Batman had liberated from the Joker to use as a last resort. Superman takes on all the infected heroes as Batman enters the others' ship. He runs into Jimmy but is still prepared to detonate the device if need be.<br/></p> <p>When Superman is faced with the others and Despero, he tries to talk things out again. He tells them that not all humans are evil and need to be wiped out. He reminds them that he was from another planet and taken in by humans. There was no personal gain for them. He's been embraced by the world as Superman. He has seen the nobility of the human spirit and wants to be part of that. He then tells them that Despero lied to them. Outraged, Despero tries to stop Superman from talking to the others. He asks Luthor how to destroy Superman. Before Lex can answer, Batman gives him a boot to the head.</p> <p>The others are still unsure. The fact that they've been listening means that they are conflicted. Superman tells Batman that he has to believe in them and trust them the way he does with him. Hesitating for a second, Batman does. The conflict is over immediately. All those infected have been released. The aliens leave without a word.<br/></p> <p>Bruce Wayne now thinks over his ways. Superman saved the world because he believes in humans. Bruce realizes that he needs to try that himself. He tries to be a nicer person in his Bruce Wayne persona and reestablishes his friendship with Superman.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The man at the top of Bucky's hitlist is finally in his grasp... but saying anything more than that will spoil all our surprises! Still, the final moments of this issue will stun fans just as much as the final moments of Captain America #25 did!</em></p><p>Red Skull isn't too happy with Dr. Faustus for having lost Winter Soldier. He wants Agent 13 punished. His main concern is the fact that Bucky knows their secrets. They have to set their contingency plans into motion.</p><p>On the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, Winter Soldier sits, handcuffed to a table, with his mechanical arm removed. S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists are surprised that most of it is of their design. That means either they had a Russian mole or Winter Soldier is working for Nick Fury. When they try to get a closer look at the arm, one scientist is shocked to unconsciousness. The arm levitates up and knocks out the other two scientists. It then makes its way up the wall into a ventilation shaft.</p><p>Falcon is out looking for Faustus and Sharon. He tells Stark to look after Bucky. Since he was important to Captain America, he's important to him also. Tony tells him not to worry about him. The power goes out momentarily and he finds out that Winter Soldier is no longer being held. The guards are knocked out but still alive. Tony armors up and orders that lethal force is not approved.</p><p>Out of the shadows, Winter Soldier attacks Iron Man. He tells him he's stupid for actually bringing him there. He tries an EMP attack but Tony was prepared for it. Iron Man blasts him and tells him they don't need to do it this way. Winter Soldier continues to punch and shoot at him. Iron Man isn't too concerned until he is thrown against some exposed electrical wires. As his armor recharges, Winter Soldier attacks again. He manages to rip off Tony helmet then knocks his legs out from beneath him. Winter Soldier rolls to his feet with a gun in hand and aims it at Tony's face. He asks Tony what was he trying to say about him not being able to hurt him. Tony tells Bucky that he's good and he's glad. He also tells him that if he even flinches, his repulsor blasts from his hands will liquefy his brains. He tells him he doesn't want that to happen because he is trying to do right by Steve. He wants to honor his last wishes. Bucky doesn't know what he's talking about and Tony tells him he has a letter from Steve.</p><p>In Stark's office Black Widow arrives with guards to find Bucky seated reading the letter. He orders the guards to leave but tells Natasha she can stay. Winter Soldier questions if the letter is real. Tony tells him he's had it tested numerous times and the lawyer that delivered it was legit. He tells him they need to put aside their differences and get the man that really killed Steve, the Red Skull. Winter Soldier tells them that the Red Skull is Aleksander Lukin. Somehow they are sharing the same body. Tony is surprised because there was a report earlier that Lukin was killed and his body was found. They know it's fake and that the Skull set this up when he knew that S.H.I.E.L.D. got a hold of Winter Soldier.</p><p>Winter Soldier isn't sure he should take Stark's offer. He says that the letter doesn't clearly state that this was Steve's wishes. Stark tells him that he knows Bucky wouldn't let anyone else fill those shoes. He asks if he wants to be the one to let Steve down. Winter Soldier says he'll do it under two conditions. The first is he wants his mind completely scanned for any programming left over or any failsafe word implants. The second condition is that he will not work for Stark or anyone, just like Steve didn't work for anyone. Tony ponders this and agrees.</p><p>Later as Winter Soldier is being probed, Natasha says she doesn't think he's ready to take this on just yet. Tony says Cap would disagree. Besides, Winter Soldier already has the shield...</p>",
