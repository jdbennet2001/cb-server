Then, in perfect timing, O.N.E. arrives, headed by  Agent Cooper. As they head back to X-Factor, Jamie hallucinates  Layla, who says that Cooper can’t possibly understand them because she’s not “one of us.” She then proceeds to chant “one of us” throughout the issue.<br /> <br />When they arrive at X-Factor, Agent Cooper gives them two options. They can disband and be placed in witness protection or they can work for O.N.E. She gives them 24 hours to decide. “One of us”.<br /> <br />Jamie goes to the hospital to check on the man he helped earlier, only to find out he’s died. Afterwards, he sits on the stoop and talks to ‘Layla’, who tells him that  Theresa is pregnant and he must have known it deep down because how else could a figment of his imagination tell him? “One of us.” Jamie asks her why she keeps quoting that and she says it’s from that movie, Freaks. Jamie then meets up with  X-Factor, lets Siryn know (and therefore telling the rest of X-Factor) he knows she’s pregnant.<br /> <br />24 hours later, Agent Cooper shows up to get their decision, only to find the building empty, but a laptop on the desk. She plays the video waiting for her. It’s Jamie, saying they decided to pass on both choices, and telling her not to bother hunting them down. And also to get the hell out of the building, because it’s going to blow. <br /> <br /><em>Detroit, five months later</em>; a dark-haired lady is at a house, looking for X-Factor, greeted by a very pregnant Theresa. Cut to a diner, Jamie is sitting alone, asking for the check when Val Cooper comes up behind him and twists his hand, hard. She informs him that she knows he didn’t break any laws blowing up his own building, but she doesn’t scare so easily. And that this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Once coming across Abin Sur's space ship, they--the army--take it into a hangar and begin attempting to disassemble it. Hector Hammond is notified that they've just been able to disassemble the thrusters and are now near the fuel chamber. Hector, eager to get his hands on it, rushes in to take a look--without wearing his radiation shielded helmet. He begins to open the fuel chamber--believing that it's empty--and causes a small explosion which exposes himself to a high level of radiation. While getting medical treatment, Hector realizes that he can do things with his mind. Being full of rage, Hector takes it out on everyone that's around him and kills them all.<br/><br/>Meanwhile back on Oa, Hal has just graduated from Green Lantern boot camp and was shipped out. Back on the airfield Tom recognized Hal as the Green Lantern and confronts him about it. Hal admits it to Tom in a round-about way. Tom then notifies Hal that everyone has just quit after Carol Ferris took over the reigns from Mr. Arden.<br/><br/>Things are going bad for Carol. She is trying to recruit any and all pilots for her airfield but no one is taking her offer no matter what it is. Just then, Hal walks into her office and tells her that he is also calling it quits. She instead takes an enormous risk and offers him a job as a pilot. Hal is hesitant to take the job because now he does not need an airplane to fly. <br/><br/>Atrocitus, still on the run from Abin Sur's airship, comes across a campsite and kills it occupants. He begins to perform a ritual over the campfire in search for \"the being that will birth the black\".<br/><br/>Hal, now back in the pilot's seat at Ferris airfield takes his first flight. He is supposed to be running a test flight under strict conditions. Just as Carol says that this is Hal's last chance he messes it up. Sinestro, comes to Earth to investigate Abin's successor and notices that Hal is flying without his ring. Therefore, he stops directly in front of Hal's aircraft and it blows up in mid-air. Hal, realizing what has just happened, tries to use his ring's power to reconstruct the aircraft. This whole time he's getting a lecture from Sinestro about the rules of not questioning a superior veteran or officer, why he can fraternize in another sector from his own, etc.<br/><br/>Sinestro then reassembles the aircraft for Hal and Hal is allowed to land the aircraft safely on the ground. As soon as he hops out of the cockpit he gets an earful from Carol. They, Hal and Carol, at that moment hit the deck with immense pain in their heads. Hector Hammond has just emerged from the hangar and now realizes that he can also read minds...</p>",
