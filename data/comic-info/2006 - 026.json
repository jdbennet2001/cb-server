Will there be any New X-Men left stop Stryker’s vision of the future from coming to pass? Lives will be lost as we discover the shocking truth behind Stryker’s miracles? Find out here! Part 3 (of 4). </p> <p>Stryker reveals his plans and their origins to a dumbfounded Icarus. He tells how he felt lost and abandoned by God until he was sent “a gift from God” in the form of a Nimrod unit. Using Nimrod’s historical records from the future, Stryker set out to ensure that the mutant-hunting future from which Nimrod escaped comes to pass. He selectively saved the lives of those destined to die in order to build an army of loyal followers. He then set about killing all those mutant and former mutants who blocked the path to Nimrod’s future. Dust sets off to find Jay, refusing an offer of help from X-23. Prodigy learns that his parents have decided he should stay at the Institute despite his power loss just moments before the news of Wallflower’s murder hits. Laurie’s friends are shocked by her sudden death and Josh is wracked with grief and anguish, which triggers an offensive aspect of his power. Stryker reveals that Jay is just bait to bring Dust to him, as she is the last one standing between him and the future vision he saw via Nimrod. Jay watches in horror as Dust arrives at Stryker’s church and is mowed down by gunfire. The vision does not immediately change but Stryker seems certain the future is set. He gloats and damns Jay before shooting him. The X-Men leave the grounds mere moments before Stryker arrives. He uses the gauntlet of Nimrod to disable the Sentinels and then calls on his troops to attack.</p>",

Isis gives Renee a beautiful rose, and tells her that the question she must ask is who she really is. On that cryptic note, the Black Marvel family fly away, and Charlie is greeted by two friends, Aristotle Rodor and Richard Dragon. Question reveals that Dragon was his martial arts teacher, and will now be giving Renee lessons.</p><p>Week 26, Day 2.</p><p>Metropolis.</p><p>Steel and Natasha Irons have at it on the television talkshow \"You Are Wrong.\" The show, which is modelled on O'Reilly, features a combative anchor who sets the uncle and niece to arguing over the legitimacy of Luthor's Infinity Inc. Steel argues that the team does not have enough training, and are all too young and inexperienced to fight crime. Natasha counterattacks him by saying that they train everyday, and that they all possess a more important attribute - heroism and a desire to do good. Natasha is called away to Infinity Inc., leaving Steel in a contemplative mood.</p><p>Week 26, Day 4.</p><p>The Sivana Family Home.</p><p>As robotic butlers, overseen by Venus Sivana, prepare a sumptuous feast - the young Sivana children, Georgia and Junior, play at mad scientist in the basement. As their mother calls them up for dinner, they scamper up the stairs, watched by a caged monster with red, glowing eyes. Venus goes to greet her guests, who turn out to be none other than the Black Marvel Family.</p><p>Venus tells the Black Marvels that her husband, the classic Captain Marvel villain Dr. Sivana, disappeared weeks ago without a trace. Venus reveals that she invited Black Adam, Isis and Osiris so they would consider helping her family to find Dr. Sivana.</p><p>Oolong Island.</p><p>Guards fight off Baron Bug's errant Manitmachine, and the little mad scientist freaks out and accuses the others of sabotage... that is until word goes out that a woman has arrived on the island. The nerdy little scientists are greeted by Dr. Veronica Cale, a Wonder Woman villain, who will be helping the Oolong scientists with their mysterious Four Horsemen project.</p><p>Sivana Family Home.</p><p>At the table, the Sivana Family - Venus, eldest children Beautia and Magnificus, who take after their mother, and younger children Georgia and Junior, who take after their father - entertain the Black Marvels. Black Adam tells Venus that they will take looking for Dr. Sivana under consideration, but Osiris is having none of it. Osiris can't accept that Black Adam and Isis are willing to help find a crazy, mad scientist and leaves the table.</p><p>Suddenly the Sivana family dinner is crashed - literally - by a giant anthropomorphic crocodile, who leaps onto the table. The crocodile barrels through the family and the walls, escaping into the garden. In the garden, Osiris is moping until he hears a rustling in the bushes and is confronted by the crocodile, who is devouring a couple of stolen roast chickens.</p><p>The crocodile, with a personality quite opposite of what one might expect, pleads with Osiris not to hurt him and tells him that Dr. Sivana took him from the Nile and performed horrible experiments on him until he became this way, then abandoned him. The crocodile burst free of his cage and was going to escape, but smelled the dinner and just couldn't help himself. The crocodile wishes that he had friends to eat dinner with, and the lonely Osiris immediately takes him under his wing and decides to give him a name.</p><p>Plus: The Origin Of Hawkman and Hawkgirl with Joe Bennett</p>",

Finding himself in the middle of a provincial squabble between an old man and the local yakuza, Sano returns to his old \"fight merchant\" ways and agrees to do some ad hoc butt kicking for pay. But the old man he's hired to tangle with might be his strongest foe to date.</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Act 228: A Man's Back 1: Fight Merchant Reestablished</li><li>Act 229: A Man's Back 2: Two Alike</li><li>Act 230: A Man's Back 3: Portrait of a Family</li><li>Act 231: A Man's Back 4: Explosive</li><li>Act 232: A Man's Back 5: Character of Evil</li><li>Act 233: A Man's Back 6: Cry of the Mountain</li><li>Act 234: A Man's Back 7: The Back Tells Tales</li><li>Act 235: White As the Snow Seen That Day</li><li>Act 236: Landing</li><li>Act 237: Quarrel</li></ul>",
