            "description": "<p><em>In this shocking finale, Doctor Strange's new arch-enemy forces him to make an impossible choice between saving millions of lives or the life of Strange's best friend.</em></p><h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>Wong lies near death in the arms of the Night Nurse. She tells Stephen that he no longer has a pulse. Strange puts a binding spell on Nicodemus as he looks at Wong. As he turns back, they discover that Nicodemus is gone. He went to destroy the Panacea. Getting it back is Wong's only hope.</p><p>Nicodemus is in the washroom ready to pour the potion down the drain as Stephen arrives. He questions why he hasn't destroyed it before now if he's had it all this time. Nicodemus says that the potion is a poison. It's not natural to cure all sickness in the world. Stephen then tells him that he forgives him for the surgery that failed to save his hands. He admits it was his own recklessness that caused it.</p><p>Nicodemus tries to leave again through a portal to the roof of Timely Pharmaceuticals, but Stephen shows up an instant later. Nicodemus finally decides to cast a spell he can still recall. It prevents both of them from using any sorcery for three minutes. Nicodemus claims that while Stephen has spent decades relying only on sorcery while he has been keeping his body in shape. As Stephen slowly takes off his gloves to reveal his old scarred hands, Nicodemus begins the pummel Stephen. Stephen was merely waiting for Nicodemus to waste his energy and delivers a hard kick to Nicodemus' midsection. He then informs him that while Wong is his servant, in other ways, he is his master. Stephen has spent time studying the martial arts along with sorcery.</p><p>Knowing he cannot beat Stephen, Nicodemus takes out the container with the Panacea. He screams at Stephen to get away and slips off the roof.</p><p>The three minutes are up so Stephen can now levitate down to where Nicodemus' bloody remains lie on the ground surrounded by the broken vial pouring down the gutter. Nicodemus' astral body appears then. He cast it the moment before impact. He will not be able to project it for too long. He tells Stephen that with a drop of the Panacea, he can spend a few hours studying it and replicate it or he can use that drop to save Wong. Stephen is torn, save his friend or save the world. Before Nicodemus' form disipates, he reminds Stephen that part of his oath was to never withhold treatment from a patient under his care.</p><p>Back at Strange's Sanctum Sanctorium Wong awakes. As Night Nurse tends to Stephen's gunshot wound, she tells him that she found an internal memo from Timely that incriminates all those involved. Stephen then makes Night Nurse an offer to open up her hospice there at his Sanctum to make up for the destruction caused during their fight against the Marrakant demon. She accepts and they embrace and kiss.</p>",

Worse yet, she's ordered to investigate a possible connection between Wonder Woman and this movement by Sarge Steel and the department of Metahuman Affairs!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>This issue does not pick up after the events of issue 4</strong></p><p> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Because Wonder Woman is still a fugitive, the Department of Metahuman Affairs is concerned over the spread of the Athenian Women's Help Shelter. It seems that several of the women have some connection to Wonder Woman. Their tapes mention being inspired by her and so forth. Diana is sent to one to see if there actually is a connection. This works out for Diana because she is also curious.</p><p> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As she meets with the director of the shelter (who too was a victim inspired after seeing Wonder Woman in action), a call is put through to the shelter. A woman is reporting her violent husband but is cut off.

He is almost relieved to see Wonder Woman. It turns out he used to be a costumed rogue and sees taking Wonder Woman out as an opportunity. He attempts to shoot her despite her warning. The bullet bounces off her braclet and hits him in the shoulder. Wonder Woman grabs him by the neck, tells him he will surrender and confess to everything, never see his wife again, and throws him out through the door. She then takes the woman to the shelter.</p><p> </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back at headquarters, Diana reports that there is no connection between Wonder Woman and the shelter.

He has confessed to beating his wife along with plenty more. He has made it clear that he does not want to see the outside world again. As they open the door, they find a bloody mess with parts of Joey ripped out and thrown across the locked holding room.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>How do you defeat an opponent you can't hurt, much less kill? How do you fight someone that's brutalized you all your life, and enjoys it? X-23 had better figure it out quick, because the assault on X and her newfound family isn't over. Kimura has just entered the battle, and she won't stop until X-23 has been returned to the Facility and her family is dead.</em></p><h3>Spoilers</h3><p>X-23 continues to tell Captain America and Matt Murdock what happened to her aunt and cousin.</p><p>X-23 lies on the floor after Kimura snapped her neck. Kimura asks her how many people do they need to kill before she realizes that she's a weapon and not a person. She handcuffs X-23 to her and drags her down into the basement. Kimura is going to force her to watch her kill Debbie and Megan.</p><p>Debbie is still unconscious and Kimura prepares to shoot Megan with a crossbow. As the arrow is shot, X-23 manages to pop her claws and slice the arrow in half in mid air. She then tries to slice through the handcuffs. Kimura tells her that they are adamantium. Looking at Megan in the eyes, X-23 begins to beat on Kimura. It's all pointless as Kimura was designed so that she couldn't be hurt by X-23. Grabbing part of the railing to the stairs, Kimura begins to strike X-23 over and over telling her that she's lost.</p><p>Kimura pins X-23 down and asks her if she should put her finger through Megan's brain or heart. X-23 begins to plead with Kimura. She says she'll return to the facility if she lets them go. Kimura tells her that she's already going back. She has to decide how Megan will die. Kimura then tells X-23 that she could always kill her and make it more merciful as she begins pushing her finger through Megan's chest. Suddenly there is a splash of blood on Megan face.</p><p>X-23 did not kill Megan. Rather she cut off her own hand. Now able to escape her handcuff, she places it on a pipe near the wall. Kimura is enraged. X-23 tells Megan and Debbie to grab her duffel bag and anything they really need. They have three minutes to get out of the house. Kimura yells that they're dead. Everyone X-23 loves will be dead. Slicing through a gas pipe, X-23 causes the house to explode.</p><p>Captain America mentions that he remembers S.H.I.E.L.D. being called in. They found pieces of advanced weaponry and the remains of 27 bodies. X-23 asks if Kimura was found. Captain America says no.</p><p>As they drive away from their house, Debbie tells X-23 to stop the car. She tells her that after X-23 saved Megan from the man that took her and Sarah brought her home, she gave her a picture of X-23. She says that Laura was able to make Sarah love again. She had been hurt by their father and couldn't love anyone. X-23 saved her. She saved them all.</p><p>In Sacramento in a motel, X-23 is preparing some passports for Megan and Debbie. Megan asks X-23 if she needs one, and she says no. Megan then takes the passport picture of Sarah.</p><p>Later at the U.S./Canadian border in Washington, Laura tells them that they have enough money to get to a safe house. She says there's more money there and to keep moving for the first month. Megan asks if she's going with them. Laura says she can't. Kimura will never stop looking for her. She can't risk their lives again. Megan asks how will Laura find them. X-23 doesn't answer, she merely says good-bye. As she turns to leave, Megan stops her. She gives her a locket that she was planning on giving her later. Inside is a picture of Laura's mom on one side and one of her on the other. Laura thanks her and embraces her. That's the last time she ever saw them.</p><p>Murdock asks her what she did next. X-23 says she then went after \"him.\" She went after the man that started it all and made her a weapon. She stands outside the gate of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>(Continued from Justice League of America #8)</em></p><p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Part 2 of the 5-part JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA/JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA crossover with \"The Lightning Saga!\" Batman and Starman break into the depths of Arkham Asylum in search of the one person who may be able to reconcile Starman's past. But with nightmares literally around every corner, that person may be dead before they reach him. Plus, a battle within the Fortress of Solitude reveals the key to it all, especially the members of the team!</p><p>The Justice Society of America and the Justice League of America have split up to solve the case involving the Legion of Super-Heroes. In Gotham City, Hell has broken loose in Arkham Asylum. The G.C.P.D. are outside, including Comissioner Gordon and Detective Bullock. The Bat-signal is on in the hopes that Batman will arrive to assist them. He arrives with some \"friends.\" Geo-Force, Sandy Hawkins, and Starman are with him.</p><p>Gordon tells them about the riot inside. The inmates are screaming, some need to be hospitalized, and others are dead. They've deduced that perhaps Scarecrow has managed to make some fear gas that has affected everyone inside. Batman notices a patient whose brother was killed after being bitten by an African Velvet Spider. There are still some crawling on her. Batman says that Scarecrow's gas doesn't work this way. Someone has created real nightmares.</p><p>Batman asks Sandy what else he saw in his dream. Sandy tells him that he also saw him being torn to shreds inside. Starman mentions the \"doctor with no face\" and Dream Girl both being inside. Batman thinks about this and deduces that Starman is talking about Doctor Destiny. He used to have a dreamstone that made nightmares a reality. With the some-what crazy Starman leading them, they head towards the Asylum.</p><p>Batman tries to ask Starman what Dream Girl's powers were. He says she can walk into the Dreaming and see the future. Sandy notes that she must be like him. Geo-Force asks about Sandy's ability to cause tremors and raise lava. Starman says he can make things heavy. Geo-Force, feeling proud of himself, says that he has both their powers combined. Starman's reply to this is that he smells like mud.</p><p>Batman has come up with a plan to enter quietly to avoid the nightmares Dr. Destiny has created from the other inmates. They notice that Starman has disappeared and see him walking up the front steps. Inside, Starman finds the security monitors and finds Dream Girl. He tries taking the monitor off the wall and is upset when it goes blank. Batman arrives to remind him it was just a television monitor.</p><p>Now they are entering the heart of Arkham. Geo-Force mentions that they have to be prepared to face their nightmares. Batman says they have worse nightmares to worry about, those of the inmates like Two-Face, Mad Hatter, and Riddler. Geo-Force asks what are they afraid of. As Batman says they're all afraid of him, at least half a dozen \"Batmans\" appear in different variations to fight them.</p><p>Starman leaves the fight detecting Dream Girl on the other side of a wall. Smashing through, he finds her chained up with Dr. Destiny standing over her. Destiny pulls out the nightmares of Starman. Out comes the dead Kenz Nuhor, a former teammate that Starman killed in self-defense when he was hurting Dream Girl.</p><p>As Nuhor wraps his hands around Starman's neck, he recalls the alien words that can wake her up. Her ring is activated and she regains consciousness. She slams Destiny against the wall and all the nightmares disappear.</p><p>Dream Girl and Starman are finally reunited. She says that she's missed him but the nightmares are just the beginning for the Legion. She has seen a vision and by coming to this time, one of them is going to die.</p><p>At Superman's Fortress of Solitude, he, along with Red Tornado, Stargirl, and Cyclone search for Superman's Legion ring. Stargirl encourages Cyclone to talk to Red Tornado because their powers are similar. She is reluctant because Power Girl told her to \"watch [her] motormouth.\" Cyclone had met Red Tornado when she was six. He had saved her when Professor Morrow kidnapped her. She stumbles with her words but Red manages to reassure her.</p><p>Superman locates his ring in his trophy room. Stargirl admires his display models of thirty of the Legion of Super-Heroes. She had never heard of them before. Red Tornado fills her in that they were a team of heroes from the 31st Century made up of representatives from dozens of alien worlds. Superman says they were his friends. He tells them how, growing up, he didn't have a lot of friends. He accidentally broke a boy's arm when playing football. He had to be careful and didn't have anyone to talk to about his powers besides his parents. Then one day, three of the Legion visited him and took him to the future. They said he would become the inspiration that helped create the Legion. He feels that, in the end, they inspired him more.</p><p>Red Tornado's sensors detects the second Legion ring. He says that one of the statues is wearing it. Cyclone asks why there's two of Wildfire. Superman says it's not a statue and speaks the alien phrase that wakes him up.</p><p>Superman checks his suit yo make sure there's no leaks. His body is made up of anti-energy and his suit is the only thing keeping him together. Wildfire weakly says that he couldn't move or speak. He says he's gonna kill Braniac-5 and needs to hit something. Then he mentions \"the storm\" when there's a flash of light. Batman's utility belt has appeared in the room. Batman asks Wildfire what's going on and why is the Legion there.</p><p><em>(To be continued in Justice League of America #9)</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em></em>The Ultimates have journeyed into the Supremeverse to do battle with the Squadron Supreme. And they’re amazed by the destruction that has occurred there due to the unintentional meddling of the Fantastic Four’s young leader Reed Richards. It’s a clash of the greatest powers from two universes! Don’t miss it!<br /></p> <p><br /></p><h3><em>Spoilers</em></h3><br /><br />Nick Fury and the heroes from the Ultimate Universe arrive in the Supremeverse and it's already time for a fight. Fury orders Thor to engage Hyperion and he complies. Hyperion and the Thunder God prove to be too evenly matched so Fury sends The Human Torch and The Invisible Woman to back up his man. On the Helicarrier Fury explains why he sent them. Other then Iron Man they are the only fliers and according to him are more expendable. The flying ship heads for Richards while Sue and Johnny assist Thor. The Invisible Woman contains Hyperion in a bubble but his super strong punches prove to be too much and she can barely hold him in. The Human Torch tells her to open up a hole so he can pump in his flames. The fire doesn't seem to phase Hyperion so The Human Torch leaves nothing back and goes nova, aiming all his power into the sphere.  <p>Unfortunately, all Johnny's efforts do nothing but annoy Hyperion. With a single blast of his laser vision Hyperion both breaks The Invisible Woman's sphere and sends The Human Torch plummeting to the ground. Sue, who had been forced to land due to the strain of maintaining the force field, catches her brother before he hits the ground but she passes out immediately after. What comes next is astounding but also frightening. Thor attacks a mad (but calm) Hyperion but winds up on the receiving end of an attack. Hyperion, moving faster than Thor can react to, grabs Thor, takes his hammer, hits him with it, and throws both to the ground.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the Helicarrier, Nick Fury explains that their target is the Supremeverses version of Washington DC. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch think it's foolish to assume that America rules this world but they let Fury think what he wants. Captain America informs Spider-Man that he thinks Fury is hiding something.</p> <p>Somewhere on the ground, Reed Richards, the man this whole commotion is about, is being escorted \"to a more secure location.\" On his way, he takes the time to look outside and sees that the heroes of two universes are going at each other with everything they've got.</p>",

The Batman puts Dick Grayson to the ultimate test, and the orphaned aerialist must make a difficult choice before becoming Robin, the Boy Wonder!</i></p><p><i>Five hours ago...</i></p><p>Wonder Woman is in Metropolis and is not happy. She is disgusted with \"man's world\" with all the stink and filth around. She thinks something has to be done about Batman. She meets with Superman, Hal Jordan, and Plastic Man. Superman has gathered them there because of Batman's latest alleged kidnapping of a young boy. He says they need to bring him in and turn him over to the authorities. Hal comes to his defense saying that they don't know if he really kidnapped the kid. He suggests they find him and try to talk some sense into him. Plastic Man thinks they should have him join them. He thinks Batman is cool and would make them look \"edgier.\" It seems he may be saying this to get Wonder Woman riled up. She wants to hunt him down and kill him. She wants to cut off his head and put it on a stake to show the world that they will police their own.</p><p>Superman lashes out, yelling and slamming his fist against the wall. The wind from the force is enough to knock down Wonder Woman as if she were nothing. She is outraged over being caused to bleed. She tells Superman she hates his guts and that he makes her sick. She spits on him then they share a passionate kiss. She leaves saying they will have their chance. If they cannot settle things, they she will take care of Batman.</p><p><i>Now, Gotham City...</i></p><p>Batman is running across the rooftops...laughing. He is thrilled to be alive and on the hunt. Hearing a woman scream, he jumps down into an alley, laughing some more. He brutally takes out two men trying to have their way with a woman. He gives one man a compound fracture in his arm that will never heal properly so he will always remember him. The other man has his teeth smashed. When he mutters at Batman, he simply pounds on him over and over again. The woman watches in shock, then slowly begins to smile.</p><p>In Wayne Manor, Alfred is working out with a punching bag. He thinks back about how Bruce's mother never really got to know the real Bruce. He says it wasn't until her last seconds in life that she would see the demon in his eyes as she and her husband lie in the alley dying. Alfred is concerned with Bruce taking in a young boy to enter his dark world. He prays that the boy will survive. He is concerned over the sanity of Bruce.</p><p>In the Batcave, Dick Grayson is exploring the place. He thinks that it is almost like a museum. He finds a section that is filled with medievil weapons. He notes that the weapons are all polished and sharpened, ready to use. He picks up a huge axe and thinks how cool that is.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>In the days of the Cold War, the nuclear powers put forward the theory that if two superpowers each possessed the firepower to obliterate the other, they would never go to war. This was known as Mutual Assured Destruction. MAD. Now, once again two great superpowers face one another. On one side, the Sentry. On the other, Black Bolt. Totally MAD.</em></p><p>The Inhumans have landed and begun their attack on the Pentagon. Black Bolt stands silent as Karnak instructs the Inhumans. They easily cut through the human military, but it’s not long before the Mighty Avengers arrive. The Avengers descend upon the Inhumans and attack. Sentry however, stays out of the fight. Instead of fighting, he questions the whole idea of the Avengers and says, to himself, that they are less heroes, and more soldiers. They have the power to fight and they use it by following the orders of others. They don’t think, they just fight. Even Iron Man, the most intelligent of them is primarily a warrior. While Sentry is thinking about all this, the rest of his team is calling for him to come into battle. He continues to stay out of the fight but asks Cloc to tell him what’s going on inside and the machine complies.</p><p>While a skeleton crew of guards stands watch of the imprisoned Inhumans, Woz, an Inhuman capable of traveling through reflective surfaces infiltrated the building. He was necessary because the Pentagon had technology that prevented the rest of the Inhumans from teleporting in via Lockjaw. Once inside, Woz sets off an explosive that opens a path to where his comrades are being kept. Upon seeing Woz, Jolen demands to be let out, but Woz has to turn off the security holding them in their cells first. Fortunately, has a telepathic link with a diviner, an Inhuman hacker, so he is able to shut down the Pentagon’s computers and break Gorgon, Jolen and the others out. Gorgon says that they won’t leave without the crystals and Woz tells him that he knows where they are.</p><p>Cloc tells Sentry all of this and also informs him that the diviner has made the Pentagon’s surveillance systems think that the Inhumans were still locked up, allowing them to roam freely. Cloc asks Sentry if he should alert Iron Man, but Sentry says no.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the battlefield, a psychic Inhuman gets into Ares’ mind and makes him think he is standing in the blood of all the people he’s killed. The blood is a little higher than his waist and Ares says, “Ha! It was so few?” Seeing that Ares is incapacitated, Ms. Marvel sends Wasp to take down the psychic. The psychic is knocked out but Ares is still disabled. Cloc says that now that Ares is down, Inhuman victory is a 59% probability and recommends that Sentry intervene. Sentry asks what will happen if he gets into the fight but Cloc says there are too many variables to predict. Sentry thinks to himself that if he starts fighting Black Bolt might stop holding back like he was currently doing.</p><p>In a secret part of the Pentagon, the Inhumans find that the crystals are not where they should be. As Gorgon starts to destroy the place, Cartwright comes up behind them and gives the crystals. He says he’s returning them because they are part of the Inhuman culture, but after they leave his face is revealed and it’s obvious that he’s about to die from what the crystals did to his body. With his last words he says that he hopes the crystals will kill them all.</p><p>In Attilan, Medusa takes Luna to see Maximus. Luna doesn’t want to go but Medusa wants her to heal her uncle. Medusa makes Luna look at Maximus and the girl sees a black octopus trapped in a cage of light in his head. Maximus says the Pacifiers put the monster there, but Luna thinks that they just trapped it so it couldn’t get out. Luna then looks at Medusa and sees that she’s not herself. She can’t do anything though because Medusa forces her to “heal” Maximus. Inside his head, the cage fades and the creature is freed.</p><p>Outside the Pentagon, the battle continues to rage on. Ares is still down and the Sentry still won’t help so Iron Man is forced to use a full-on repulsor blast. The Inhumans are scattered and Karnak tells them to gather around Lockjaw for a retreat. Ms. Marvel says that they won, but Maria Hill radios in and tells them that they should be careful. When Black Bolt first declared war, he did it by having all the Inhumans leave and blasting the humans with a whisper. Maria thinks he might be doing it again. She’s right.</p><p>Black Bolt opens his mouth and levels the Avengers. The blast also breaks down a wall of the Pentagon. The Avengers get up (most are ok but Black Widow is deaf) in time to see Gorgon coming through the hole in the wall with the other Inhumans who were trapped. Gorgon gives Black Bolt the crystals and Iron Man tells Sentry that he needs to attack before the Inhumans get away. Sentry says that if he fights, Black Bolt could actually hurt them instead of just whisper. As the Inhumans leave, Sentry says it’s over, but Iron Man tells him it’s not.</p><p>Twenty-four hours later, Iron Man is sitting with Maria Hill discussing what will happen next. Because of the poor showing of the Avengers, the president won’t be sending them back into battle against the Inhumans. Instead, they’ll be sending in the Terrigen-altered marines.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>All roads lead back to Earth for the final showdown over the Book of Destiny, whose possessor will have the knowledge of all that has ever been or will be! Every guest star involved will have the opportunity to glance inside the book, including Batman, Green Lantern, Supergirl, Blue Beetle, Lobo and more!</i></p><p><i>This issue takes place before the JLA/JSA Lightning Saga.</i></p><h3>Overview</h3><p>In 31st-century Metropolis, Brainiac-5 quickly manages to separate Batman from Tharok, but alas, this version of the Legion of Super Heroes has no time-travel technology, no time-bubbles, no nothing, so Batman is stranded in this future world of condescending brats, who treat him like both a legendary hero and a foundling Neanderthal, at the same time.</p><p>The probability-altering Haruspex weapon has also arrived in this era, and despite Batman’s warning, the Legion are running diagnostic tests on it, and on him. These reveal that Batman’s system is ablaze with odd chronal radiation, which is likely to open cataclysmic temporal rifts. Sure enough, the next second, a portal appears, with a hostile robot army pouring through it, identified as “Intellagents” which earlier in history were banned, in “the great A. I. Exile.” Lightning Lad and Light Lass engage these things, while another rift opens, and a swarm of pterodactyl-looking critters fly into the room. These are Rimborian Rayzers, and Chameleon Boy adopts the form of their natural enemy, a really big Thachon, but he still needs reinforcements.</p><p>Batman jumps into the fray, efficiently disabling one of the Intellagents, and the Legionnaires quickly get the fight under control. Batman tries to tell them that the Haruspex is the key to sending him back in time, which would solve their time rift problem, but Brainiac-5, and his giant ego, just aren’t listening. Plus when they test-fire the darn thing, nothing happens. Fed up, Batman knocks out Brainiac-5 (and steals his Flight Ring), decks Lightning Lad, steals the Haruxpex, deploys a smoke bomb, eludes the whole crowd of Legionnaires, and leaves the building.</p><p>Meanwhile in the 21st Century, on planet Rann, Supergirl grabs Hal Jordan and Adam Strange out of their fight with the Thanagarian Hawkmen and zooms them away, at Mach-80. In fact, she’s out of control; they pass the same platoon of Hawkmen twice, in a low-altitude planetary orbit. Green Jordan brings them to a safe landing with his power ring, and it turns out that solar-powered Kara is being over-energized by Rann’s trinary starsystem. Supergirl asks about the Book of Destiny.</p><p>The Rannian thief had gotten loose from Green Jordan during their Zeta-Beam trip to Rann, but Hal remembered him mentioning the “Rannian Underground,” so he looked up his old pal Adam Strange to find out about that. A planetwide civil war was in progress, between displaced Thanagarian Hawkmen and native Rannians, with the Thanagarians unsurprisingly winning. But in the last day or two, the tide was turning, now that the Rannian militia had the Book of Destiny.</p><p>Adam guides Hal and Supergirl to the hidden base of the Rannian forces, and they confront General Mondath, who is of course the weaselly little thief who had stolen the book back on . His forces need the omniscient Book of Destiny as a counterbalance to the Thanagarians’ omniscient Absorbascon technology, which had been uncovering every bit of Rannian knowledge and planning.</p><p>Supergirl warns Mondath that his possession of the book is (a) due to the malfeasance of the sorcerous Luck Lords, and (b) a threat to the very structure of time and space. Mondath looks up “Luck Lords” in the book, and shows the good guys a picture, asking if it shows these dangerous magicians. What it shows is Hal, Kara, and Adam, standing right where they’re standing now, with three giant, eyeball-headed figures right behind them. Oh yeah, these are the Lords of Luck.</p><p>Meanwhile in the 31st Century, in Metropolis, the Science Police are scouring the city for the fugitive Batman, and completely failing to catch him. Triplicate Girl spots him and pursues him around a corner, but by the time her teammates catch up, all three of her are tied together in “a Siamese human knot.” Batman flies away, down Binder Alley, where Colossal Boy can’t fit, and when Shrinking Violet gets too close, he knocks her out of the air with a marble from a blowgun.</p><p>By remote control, Brainiac-5 rigs his stolen ring to become trackable by the other Legion rings (which it’s already supposed to be anyway), and this enables Invisible Kid to get close enough to distract Batman, while Karate Kid gets close enough to actually attack him. This version of Karate Kid actually looks Japanese, unlike the white Karate Kid (a level-15 fighter, according to Superman) who fights Batman (a level-12 fighter) in Justice League of America v.2 #8 (June 2007), so the outcome of this fight is a toss-up. In fact, no conclusion is reached; the fight is interrupted by a fire-spewing alien monster, emerging from a third time rift, which provides enough distraction for Batman to escape again. He ducks into Metro Underground, a 31st Century slum, pursued by Star Boy and Phantom Girl, who are now homing in on a signal from his Flight Ring.</p><p>He sets up these two by leaving the Haruspex out in plain sight, with the ring under it, and jumps them, knocking out Star Boy. Phantom Girl manages to pick up the Haruspex and fire it, with the probability-defying result of bringing Dream Girl back from the dead! By this time, a huge swarm of Legionnaires are converging on Batman’s position, but Saturn Girl stops them with a telepathic broadcast, cautioning that Batman, far from being mad, is actually saving the 31st Century. The Haruspex will only fire when its target is perceived as a threat, which, with Phantom Girl holding it, it definitely does. She shoots; there’s a blinding flash; then the outcome is revealed. One of the Lords of Luck has arrived, with the Book of Destiny on one hand and, now, the Haruspex in the other. As of this moment, the Luck Lords now rule the cosmos!</p><p>To be continued …</p>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>(Los Angeles, California - Wednesday, September 12)</p><p>Mickey Musashi (Turbo) posts a letter on her blog. \"Life is all about balance.\" Her parents would have been so proud, seeing her embrace her Asian roots by getting all 'zen.' Next thing you know, she'll be spouting off about yin and yang. Ever since Mickey was a child, she found always found herself flipping back and forth between the two sides of the same coin that is her; trying to respect her Japanese heritage while growing up in America, finding it hard to stay grounded after learning how to fly. She found herself trying to leave a somewhat normal life whilst accepting the responsibilities of being a hero... and dealing with the realities of being just a girl in a costume when all her friends are blessed with powers of their own.</p><p>Now, she runs a self-help group for ex-teen heroes when she's not even sure they <i>want</i> help anymore. She feels that sometimes, opening themselves up like this only brought more trouble down around them then they ever bargained for. Mickey recounts how Mattie brought all her MGH issues when joining, which led to all kinds of unwanted costumed antics - exactly what they've been trying to avoid. Mickey made a deal with the MGH dealer's president, Miss Fuyumi Fujikawa, by putting those old Japanese language lessons to good use (another way to make her parents proud). Miss Fujikawa dropped Hollow on their laps, though Mickey is wary of her; she has a hunch about her. At the same time, Julie unloads about how she's been lying to them the whole time. Mickey has a feeling she still has a few other secrets... and that is why their balance is out of whack.</p><p>That's just the group. Mickey reflects on her tense relationship with Chris, and how she feels guilty for dating someone with powers. Mickey feels the urge to put on her old costume, take to the skies and leave all her stress behind for an afternoon in the clouds. It's tempting, but she knows that she can't give in. She is going to keep her feet planted firmly on the ground. Life is all about balance, and Mickey is the only one who has to make sure it's maintained. Otherwise, Excelsior might just spiral out of control...</p><p>(Holy Trinity Church; Excelsior meeting)</p><p>Nekra bursts into the room. Johnny Gallo (Ricochet) leaps back, Julie Power (Lightspeed) hovers around the ceiling, Mattie Franklin (Spider-Woman) unleashes her extra legs and Chris Powell (Darkhawk) activates the Darkhawk amulet. Nekra immediately begins to attack the four heroes. All the while, Mickey stands at the back... thinking. This is what happens when trust is broken. The trust she places in strangers... in her teammates... and even in her loved ones. It always comes crashing down around her. Mickey yells at Darkhawk to watch out but Nekra has already grabbed Darkhawk, and she uses him as a baseball bat to shoot Lightspeed out the building. Ricochet remembers how he, Darkhawk and Spider-Woman had stopped Nekra last time. Before he and Spider-Woman attack her, Nekra bashes both of them into a wall, leaving only Mickey and Phil, who is holding a pipe. Phil tells Mickey to stand back; Nekra thinks they're helpless - but the joke's on her! Phil laughs as he attacks Nekra, who punches him into a wall. Nekra then walks towards Mickey, the only one still standing. Grabbing her by the throat, Nekra smiles as she says, \"No Powers, No Problems!\" Just as she squeezes Mickey's throat, Nekra freezes. She looks down to her chest, where she sees a glowing red lazer-like blade jammed near her heart. Nekra immediately drops to the ground. Mickey, horrified, sees a figure standing in the distance - someone has saved her.</p><p>A girl steps into the room. Her appearance makes her look as young as Julie. Around her wrist is a metallic band, where a glowing red lazer-like knife is pointed out. The knife retracts into the band and the girl helps Mickey up. Mickey thanks her and asks who she is, but the girl says that she doesn't know. At this point, Chris awakens and warns the girl to get away from Mickey, but Mickey defends her by pointing out that she is the one who took down Nekra. She is one of the good guys. Mattie, Julie, Johnny and Phil awaken, just in time to see Chris apologize to Mickey for changing into Darkhawk. Mickey tells him never to worry about her, and she kisses him, exposing their relationship. Mattie stares at them in disbelief. Johnny is surprised but Julie smugly tells him that she knew. Phil, however, stares in maniacal anger. His eyes clench, and fury sweeps through him. Phil storms out the room. Julie wonder's what is wrong with him, but Mattie believes that it's because he got kicked by Nekra. Johnny yelps in shock - he recognizes the girl who rescued Mickey. He saw her in the Fujikawa lab; she was one of the women in the tubes. Mickey, once again, defends the girl. She also adds that Chris should turn back into Darkhawk; Nekra is still breathing. Johnny insists that the girl was one of the women in the tubes and the girl does not deny it. In fact, she mentions that she remembers seeing Johnny and Julie there, and saw them running away after Julie was attacked. The girl must have... escaped shortly after.</p><p>Mickey is now confused. She asks the girl if she escaped or was released. The girl lowers her head and says she can't remember. Mickey asks how the girl found them, and how can she use the energy blade from her wrist. The girl's voice breaks as she reveals she doesn't know. All she did was walk in, see that Mickey was in trouble, and the blade was just there. It's as if part of her memory has been wiped clean. All she knows is her name... Namie. Namie raises her head and slowly starts weeping as she begs them to help her. Mattie however rolls her eyes and doesn't trust Namie, mainly because she and Nekra's \"evil-sounding\" names both start's with 'N'. Besides, both of them showing up is a bit <i>too</i> coincidental. And they both seem to connect to the Fujikawa woman that Mickey made a deal with. A deal the rest of them know nothing about. Mickey tells Mattie to mind her business. Mattie pressures Mickey into telling her about the deal, though Mickey tells her she has to trust her on it. At the same time, police sirens blare through the church. Mattie mentions that they couldn't destroy a church and not expect someone to notice. Darkhawk is glad; S.H.I.E.L.D. can now deal with Nekra. Julie becomes desperate to leave, but Johnny tells her not to worry; they are all registered. Julie becomes flustered... she reminds the group about how she was explaining about her lies and finally coming clean. Julie finally admits she is <i>not</i> registered.</p><p>Predictably, the rest of the room explodes with anger. Mickey snaps, Mattie makes a sarcastic remark, but Darkhawk is enraged. They've been harboring a fugitive, and she could have landed all of them in jail. Johnny defends Julie, and advises her to leave immediately. She should also take Namie with her, since none of them are ready to answer any of those questions. Again, Mattie tells the group she does not trust Namie. Mickey isn't sure either, but she did save her life - that counts for something. Darkhawk adds they don't have any other choice. Mickey tells Julie and Namie to leave while they get it sorted out with the cops; the two of them, however, are not of the hook. Julie picks up Namie and leaves... but not before telling Namie she is a lot heavier than she looks.</p><p>(In-and-Out Burger)</p><p>Julie eats a burger while Namie asks if there was any place more private they could wait. Julie does not mean to offend her, but she doesn't know who Namie is and she doesn't exactly trust her - there is no way she is taking her to her apartment or anywhere 'private.' Plus, she was starving. That doesn't mean she can't try and be nice to her. She offers Namie her burger, and asks when the last time Namie ate was. Namie is confused; she doesn't remember <i>ever</i> eating. Julie, intrigued, asks what is the last thing Namie does remember. Namie reflects on how the last thing she remembered was a woman's smile. Maybe her mother's. Her voice had said \"We'll meet again soon enough.\" And then the lights went out. Next thing she knows, she was in the church basement with them, just in time to save Mickey's life with a power she doesn't know how to use. Julie admits it is all pretty convenient. Namie raises her metallic wristband and says she has no idea how to turn on the energy blade. Julie advises her not to try too hard... getting stabbed by one Fujikawa escapee (Hollow) in this lifetime's enough for her. Namie breaks down into tears and wonders what the Fujikawa labs did to her. Julie comforts her and assures her they will hook up with the rest of the group and figure things out. She asks if Namie's sure she wouldn't one just one bite of her burger. Namie smiles.</p><p>(The apartment of Phil Urich)</p><p>Phil, having left Excelsior's meeting after seeing Mickey and Chris kiss, is in his bathroom. Phil is breathing heavily, and is clutching the bathroom sink while in a sort of fit. His eyes are red. He tells himself he can fight it... he urges himself not to give in. Another voice, more darker speaks... out of Phil's own mouth. The second voice tells him there is nothing left for him. He's lost her. Phil tells himself not to listen to the second voice; Mickey still loves him. The second voice puts Phil down by telling him he is lying to himself. It is finally time to accept the truth. Phil has to admit; he's lost Mickey... and he's losing his mind. Madness truly does come to all those who don the mantle of the Green Goblin. And with that, the second voice calls, \"embrace it!\" The spirit of the Green Goblin manically laughs as it rushes through Phil, cracking the bathroom mirror. Phil, officially possessed by the spirit, gives a horrific laughter that scares a spying Hollow. Hollow instantly rushes to the living room and crawls up into a ball, in the corner, truly frightened.</p><p>(The apartment of Johnny Gallo)</p><p>Johnny enters his apartment after Mattie. He apologizes for the mess; he doesn't usually bring chicks back to his apartment on such short notice. Mattie, regardless, appreciates him letting her hang. She'll take looking at dirty laundry over sitting LA traffic anytime. Besides, this chick doesn't need short notice to school him on how to rock. She picks up his Guitar Hero. Johnny eagerly accepts the challenge, but tells her he needs to take a shower first - he still has Nekra stink all over him. Johnny tells her he'll be quick. The second Johnny steps into the shower, Mattie gets up to make sure he is occupied. She rushes to his bedroom and looks through all his drawers and mutters about how she knows Johnny is hiding something. It is at this point when Johnny arrives into the room wrapped in a towel. He asks Mattie what she's looking for. Mattie awkwardly searches for an excuse. She tells Johnny she was looking for... protection. She pulls Johnny to the bed, and Johnny asks no further questions</p><p>(Shortly after)</p><p>Mattie sits in Johnny's bathroom, bitterly thinking about how that wasn't her smartest move. A man named Mr. St. Commons calls her phone, and she answers it. She tells him she's in Johnny's apartment, and it's clean. There is no trace of her here. Mattie is sure; she examined every angle and looked under every rock. She assures Mr. St. Commons that Johnny Gallo hasn't had any contact with and doesn't know the whereabouts of his daughter. She apologizes for not finding the answer he was looking for. She hangs up. Staring at her reflection, she wonders what she got herself into. Stepping back out into Johnny's bedroom, she stares at him sleeping and worries about how awkward their situation will be.</p><p>(The apartment of Mickey Musashi)</p><p>Mickey sits on her couch... depressed. Chris, beside her, has his arm around her. Mickey whispers to him about how she almost died today. Chris reminds her that she didn't. She's still alive, here and well. Mickey tells him she is too young to die and Chris asks her why she is dwelling on it; they're super heroes - this stuff happens to them. They shake off near-death experiences and move on. \"It's a part of the world we live in,\" says Chris. Mickey, now angry, shakes him off and repeats, \"we.\" Exactly who are they? The cool kids who still have their powers? \"Phil made it pretty clear he isn't a part of 'us,'\" Mickey says. Standing up, she asks where exactly does she fit into all this; clearly, she isn't one of them. Chris is confused. By the time he stands up, he notices that Mickey is crying and Mickey confesses her angst. She was helpless. She stood their while Nekra was squeezing the life out of her and there was nothing she could do. No costume, no powers. End of story, and almost the end of her. Chris asks where all this is coming from; they are, after all, trying their best not to use their powers, to stay out of costume. Mickey asks if he really <i>is</i> trying.</p><p>Chris wraps his arms around her and tells her to stop. So she got a little shaken; she'll bounce back. But Mickey bitterly notes how they will bounce back. Fly back. And crawl back. Lucky them. Chris tells her she is the lucky one; she said it herself. Her powers came from her costume. So the costume is Turbo, not her. There were other Turbos before her, right? Mickey has the option of giving away her costume to someone else... she can walk away clean, start living a normal life again. That's a choice she can still make. A choice none of the rest of them have... but Mickey, disgusted, slaps Chris right across the face and calls him a hypocrite. Jabbing him in the chest, she tells him to take off the amulet. Rubbing his face, Chris is shocked. Mickey tells him to take off the Darkhawk amulet; it isn't melded to his chest. He can choose to take it off. So why doesn't he? Chris tells her she knows he can't. Mickey begins yelling at him; \"can't, or won't?\" Chris should practice what he preaches. Take off the amulet. Give it all up. Walk away. Fingering the amulet, Chris tells Mickey he can't do it. Darkhawk is a part of who he is. Is that what she wanted to hear? And Mickey reveals that right there is what this is all about. Before she can continue with her tirade, the doorbell rings.</p><p>As Mickey walks towards the door, she tells Chris not to think it's over just because everyone else is coming over. Chris tells her that as soon as everyone leaves, he wants to... but Mickey interrupts him, and tells him that their issue is about to become a group discussion. Opening the door, she finds Phil and Hollow. Phil is hiding his eyes, and has a hat lowered over his face. Mickey checks the halls and berates Phil for bringing Hollow in broad daylight. Phil storms into her apartment and tells her that he doesn't care. Some of them aren't afraid to hide what they truly are anymore. Grabbing him, she asks what the hell <i>that</i> is supposed to mean. If he has something to say, he should at least have the stones to say it to her face. Phil agrees, turns, and grabs Mickey by the throat. Phil mocks Mickey, and notes how she gets all fired up now that her boyfriend is here to protect her. His power has her blood pumping up, doesn't it? Mickey throws him off her and asks what the hell is wrong with him. Phil's glasses fall off, revealing his vivid red eyes.</p><p>Phil roars at Mickey and tells her that she is the one with the problem. They had a plan! Doesn't she remember? He got her a job at the Times and they were going to change the world. Put their pasts as teen super heroes behind them and start together. Together! They could do more good with their education than with their costumes. Isn't that what she had said? They were perfect for each other. But she couldn't keep her hand out of the cookie jar, could she. She had to go back for a little taste. Phil, breathing heavily, tells her that is why she really wanted to start the group. She needed to surround herself with people with powers to feel better about herself. And poor old normal Phil Urich just wasn't good enough for her, was he. Mickey tells Phil he's got it all wrong... they were friends, but she never felt that way about him. Phil slams his hand on a table, ordering Mickey not to lie to him. She used him, like she's using <i>them</i>. He loved her, but she led him on, making him believe they were alive when she really wanted to be just like the rest of them. But it's cool. Mickey wants power? Phil knows what to do to have her. He picks up a glass vase of flowers. Chris warns Phil to shut up, but Phil throws the vase at Chris' face, knocking him out.</p><p>Mickey screams while Hollow hisses, but Phil knows exactly what to do. He knows that Mickey isn't a \"stop and smell the roses\" kind of girl. He sees that now. She wants a guy who is willing to take matters into his own hands... and seize power for himself. With that, Phil rips the front of Chris' shirt and steals the Darkhawk amulet. Activating it, Phil stands before Mickey in the Darkhawk armor, laughing the maniacal laugh of a Green Goblin.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage of the movie poster for <em>Some Kind of Wonderful</em>. Darkhawk is Eric Stoltz, Mickey is Lea Thompson and Phil is Mary Stuart Masterson.</li><li>Nekra says, \"No Powers, No Problems.\" There is a scene in <em><a href=\"/runaways-10-east-coastwest-coast-part-2/4000-106059/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-106059\">Runaways #10</a></em> when Chase is speaking with Nico and says, \"Mo' Powers, Mo' Problems.\" This appears to be a reference to the Notorious B.I.G. song, \"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems,\" from the album Life After Death (1997).</li><li>Mattie says \"Namie and Nekra?! I'll take \"evil sounding names that start with 'N' please, Alex.\" This is a reference to the popular quiz show, Jeopardy, whose host since 1984 has been Alex Trebek.</li><li>Namie is revealed next issue to be a new Red Ronin model. It is hinted at this issue when Julie says, \"You're a lot heavier than you look.\"</li><li>Mattie calls Mr. St. Commons on the phone. He is Dusk's father. It appears that Mattie is looking for her.

Plus: An all-new story written by Dwayne McDuffie (FANTASTIC FOUR) spotlighting Cap and Thor's earliest partnership!</em></p><p>The Invasion of the Lava Men</p><p>The Wolf and the Other. This story, written by Macon Blair, with art by Jorge Lucas, and colors by Dave McCaig is a W.W.II story. Set in the frozen wintery forrest of Bastogne, Captain America and Bucky are confronted by a very bloodied, frightened G.I. who babbles on about a murderous giant wolf! He leads the two heroes plus a batallion of soldiers to the clearing where his unit is.....all have been horribly slaughtered!!! The wolf reappears and attacks until suddenly......Thor shows up!! This wolf is an Asgaardian beast that has escaped, and Thor takes it and brings it back. An interesting tale with a twist that I will not ruin here! The original letters page from Avengers #5 on the inside back cover, with the cover from that issue on the reverse round out this splendid book !!</p>",
