            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p> <p>The death of an X-Man reveals answers to some of the mysteries surrounding the new mutant, and creates a host of questions. The baby falls into the hands of a major player in the conflict, but things aren’t always as they seem. And it’s high noon for X-Force, the Marauders and the X-Men. </p> <p>And another mutant is killed...sort of.</p> <p><b><i>Spoilers!!</i></b></p> <p>In the future at the Mutant Relocation Camp, the Madrox dupe and Layla try to talk to young Lucas Bishop. He leaves as soon as they start talking. When they finally catch up to him he yells at them for trying to talk to him in front of the guards. They tell him they need to know who cause this horrible world. Thinking, Lucas asks them if they are Destiny Freaks. He tells them of the group of mutants that thought they were special and could lead the humans into a peaceful world. About eighty years ago, most of them vanished. The few remaining kept going until a mutant messiah was born. Things looked good until the messiah kills a million humans. Madrox tries telling him that if it wasn't for the messiah, he would have never been born. Lucas says so what. He lives in a horrible world and had to watch his parents die. He says he wishes someone would have killed the baby when it was born. He would've if he could. After Lucas leaves them a guard that Layla bumped into comes running up to them. He demands to know where his missing grenade went. It had to be her that took it. She hugs Madrox and says sorry, she knows this is the only way. The Madrox dupe dies in the explosion.</p> <p>In the present, the Stepford Cuckoos tell Emma and Scott that there were able to track Gambit. He is on what's left of Muir Island. Scott sends Bishop there along with X-Force.<br /></p> <p>Siryn is still standing over Jamie's comatose body. With the world in turmoil, Caliban dead, and Jamie lying helpless, Theresa begins to pray. She says they need him back. She needs him back. To her surprise, Jamie's eyes snap open at that moment. She calls in the others and they are shocked as an M tattoo suddenly appears on his face. He simply asks where Bishop is.<br /></p> <p>Now the pieces are falling into place. They were attacked by the Sentinels after they found out Cable was involved. Bishop worked with ONE and had access to the Sentinels. Jamie couldn't care less about all of Cable or Bishop. He says they need to go back and get Layla.<br /></p> <p>Professor X is patching up Cable. He says he has a lot to explain. Cable tells him that he knows what the future holds. He knows the baby saves everyone. He couldn't say anything to anyone because half the X-Men on his squad ended up being Marauders. There's no time to go into all the details. They need to save the baby now.</p> <p>On Muir Island, Gambit is about to hand the baby over to Mr. Sinister. He tells the others to prepare for the X-Men. When Gambit and Sinister are away from the others, Sinister is revealed to be Mystique. The real Sinister is lying on the floor. He chances of being alive don't look too good.</p> <p>At the Xavier Institute, Dust is taking more flowers to the graves as Rockslide and Mercury follow. Santos is still upset they there are stuck sitting around missing all the action when stumble across a hungry Predator X.<br /></p> <p>Back at Muir Island, the X-Force and Bishop arrive and there doesn't seem to be any sign of the Marauders. Even Bishop's high tech scanners don't pick up any signs of life. Wolverine isn't buying it. He knows that there are members of the Marauders like Lady Mastermind that can<br /></p> <p>make you think everything is not what really is. Sticking out his claws in front of him, he nails Lady Mastermind in the gut. The Marauders are revealed and the fun is about to start.</p> <p><i>To be continued in <b>New X-Men #46</b>!</i></p>",

            "description": "<p>The build-up to FINAL CRISIS continues in Part 2 of \"The Alpha Lanterns\"! In the aftermath of the Sinestro Corps War, a select few have been chosen to undergo a transformation that will leave them forever altered and forever committed to the Green Lantern Corps. But what other laws are the Guardians unleashing, and why do Hal Jordan and John Stewart want to stop them? Plus, a visit to Oa's Death Row!</p><p>• Hal Jordan is awoken in the middle of the night for a code yellow one. John Stewart was drafting something when he got the same call. When Hal and John meet up to take the call they talk about how the amount of sleep and life expectancy of Marines compares with that of Air Force pilots. When John wonders what the Green Lantern life expectancy is, the ring explains its four years, three months, one day, thirteen hours and seven minutes. You had to ask John!!</p><p>• Hal and John follow the yellow power ring all the way to Arkham Asylum as the power ring finds Jonathan Crane aka The Scarecrow. Hal and John intervene just in time and take the ring away from its intended new host. John contacts Salaak, and asks what the deal with this ring was as he thought the forgeries were shut down. Salaak responds by explaining that the ring is not a new ring and that it had belonged to Amon Sur who Salaak informs them has been killed.</p><p>• On OA, a group of Green Lanterns are in the meeting hall where Shilandra Thane accuses Laira of murdering Amon Sur. The various members present at the meeting debated over whether or not Laira's actions were warranted or if there could have been another option in dealing with Amon Sur. It was starting to get heated until Green Lantern Palaqua but a stop to it. Then Green Man asked the other Lost Lanterns if Laira's actions were justice or murder, to which all of them answer “murder.”</p><p>• Laira, now enraged, yells to anyone who will listen that Amon Sur had murdered Ke'Haan's family just to inspire others and that it was justice. She then burns Amon's body so all that is left is a skeleton. Just then, Hal enters and tries to calm things down. Boodikka tells Hal that it's not his business but Hal responds by telling Hannu that the fact he had to chase down a yellow power ring that they should have captured themselves made it his business.</p><p>• Just then, the Guardians of the Universe arrive and explain that while lethal force has been allowed against the Sinestro Corps, it is to be used only as a last resort and that the killing of a being in a moment of overwhelming rage would not be tolerated and that feeding off of negative emotion will only serve to threaten the universe. They suspend Laira and strip her of both her power ring and badge. They will hold a trial to determine her fate.</p><p>• The Guardians explain that they have decided that a new faction of the Green Lantern Corps is needed to support the new first law and to insure the enforcement of the next nine laws. They explain that it will be a police force within their police force. They begin to scan their corps to find Green Lanterns with the ability to enforce justice. They find their candidates in members such as Varix, Chaselon, Kraken, Green Man, Boodikka and John Stewart. These members of the Green Lantern Corps have been chosen to become Alpha Lanterns.</p><p>• The Guardians tell the Green Lanterns present that becoming a member of the Alpha Lanterns is the highest honor one can achieve in the Green Lantern Corps. The Guardians tell the chosen that upon touching the Alpha Lantern, that they have accepted their added responsibility of not just patrolling their sector but they will also investigate inappropriate and unlawful behavior within the Green Lantern Corps. The Alpha Lantern will connect the user's mind to the Book of OA and their body to the central power battery. Alpha Lanterns don't need to sleep and never need to recharge their battery and they will in fact receive an additional power ring. The catch? The Green Lantern must leave behind everything that he or she was in order to move forward as an Alpha Lantern. In the end, all of the applicants accept this honor except for John Stewart whom the Guardians express deep disappointment in.</p><p>• Meanwhile in space sector 650, the scarred Guardian urges Green Lantern Ash to find the corpse of the Anti-Monitor. Ash asks the Guardian why he is being chosen for this task and the Guardian responds that his crusades against Starbreaker and his vampire followers are a well-documented tale in the Book of OA. Despite what happened to his wife, Ash has hunted these killers in the darkest corners of the universe and done so without fear. Ash replies that he is not afraid of the dark. The scarred Guardian tells Ash if any bit of power remains in the corpse of the Anti-Monitor, that others will seek it out for their own purposes and explains to Ash that this is a very important mission for him to undertake. Ash asks the scarred Guardian if the others are aware of this task. They are.</p><p>• The chosen Alpha Lanterns are told to enter the surgery center where the secrets of the Alpha Lanterns would be revealed to them. As soon as they do, machines begin with some cosmetic surgery. There’s a new oath people: \"In Nights of War, Obey the Laws Forever more. Misconduct must be answered for. Swear to us the Chosen, the Alpha Corps!\" Sweet.</p><p>• The playback for the power ring shows that Amon Sur was giving himself up and that the use of lethal force was indeed not needed. Laira explains that Amon Sur was still armed. She then asks Hal if it had been his brother if he would have done the same? Jordan just looks up at a very satisfied Sinestro.</p><p>• Salaak opens up a sciencell for Laira when she tries to make a break for it. Graf Toren tries to take Laira in himself, but suddenly all of the Lantern's power rings are being depleted and nobody knows why until they see the chosen members of the Alpha Lanterns. The Guardians say that the Alpha Lanterns will embody the best elements of the military factions they had a hand in creating. The sentient drive and thought process of the Green Lanterns and the efficiency and the logic of the Manhunters. Now that the Alpha Lanterns have been activated, the Guardians are ready to enact the second law.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>She-Hulk's quest to re-discover her inner hero takes her back to her old law firm and back to face Tony Stark when an innocent bystander from her previous mission finds himself wrongly accused for murder. Can she put the past behind her?</p><p><strong><em>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead</em></strong></p><p>Jen and Jazinda continue their quest to look for the mysterious bomber named Bran. In Ohio, they stop at a gas station, with Jen prodding Jazinda about telling the truth and how she managed to resurrect herself like that. Jazinda refuses to tell and Jennifer realises that she'll tell when she's ready to tell. Just then, Jazinda calls out to Jennifer, asking to watch what's on the television: a report about Laurence Ryan, the man from the issue before who had his wife killed. The captain of the police force talks to the reporters, telling them that apparently is was space aliens who had done the murder. Some bank robbers then yell, \"This is a stick up!\" causing Jennifer to turn into She-Hulk and dispatch them.</p><p>The both of them make their way to Allentown, where they she finds Laurence in a jail cell. He blames her for this and realises that heroes aren't out there to save; there's just destruction wherever she goes. She-Hulk then swears to herself that she'll get him out of there, but thanks to the emotion, she ends up breaking the jail door, looking as if she was breaking him out of the jail, when she really meant she wanted to get him out of the situation. Just then, many of the SWAT surrounds her and the both of them end up in jail. The police captain then makes his way to the jail cell and tells Jennifer to stand up. It turns out that the captain was really Jazinda and gives her a mobile phone.</p><p>At court, the judge dismisses her to the back of the court, and Jennifer is angered by this. She looks at the public defender who is totally unprepared and says that if she was his lawyer, she would be all over this. Looking at the prosecutor, she attacks viciously, with the public defender being unable to put in a sentence, when Mallory Book comes in to represent Ms. Ryan. She-Hulk, surprised but relieved, thanks God that she came. Mallory tells the judge that the alien invasion was in fact true, and that she has someone who can provide proof for that: Iron Man. Tony tells the judge about the aliens, and how he had come across them. He adds that Laurence had in fact fought back a possible alien invasion. The judge rethinks and dismisses Laurence as innocent. As the court case finishes, people surround Iron Man for an autograph. She-Hulk looks on with hatred, about all the pain he's caused for heroes. Iron Man then gives her an \"autograph\", which turns out to be a note that says, \"I'm sorry.\" Laurence then catches Jennifer on the way out and tells her that her \"friend\" had come to help her. Mallory, insulted by such titles tells Jennifer that she is not her friend; the only reason why she came was to see Jennifer squirm.</p><p>Later at night, Jazinda and Jennifer talk about the note. Jazinda asks if Iron Man had actually meant it with the sorry note. Jennifer says that he probably did mean it and ponders about her friends betraying her, and the people who can't stand her helping her out at the strangest times. Jazinda, out of the blue, then says, \"I can't die.\" Jennifer, taken a-back by this asks her to rephrase. Jazinda goes to explain that she can't die, and that's the reason why her race had thought she betrayed them. Jazinda then says she'll explain more later and that she'll drive. While driving, Jennifer throws the note out the window. The RV stops and Jennifer walks out to pick up the note, saying that she shouldn't have littered. Jazinda asks if that's the reason why she's smoothing the crunched up the note out, with Jennifer replying, \"Shut up.\"</p>",

What brings him to Oa – and why are the dead growing restless?</p><p><b>SPOILERS</b>:</p><p>Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner officially open “Warriors” a bar and grill dedicated to serving old fashioned American cuisine to aliens from around the universe. Guy demonstrates his knowledge as a restaurateur as he instructs his extra terrestrial staff on the finer points of pouring a beer and the nature of a hamburger. Warriors proves to be a hit, and the two Lanterns discuss hiring a full time manager over a beer while Kyle doodles on a napkin. Guy’s ring sounds a reminder that in two weeks he is scheduled to return to for a reunion with Ice.</p><p>The two Lanterns continue to talk with Kyle wondering if the Black Mercies have digested Mongul yet. While Guy goes on to state that Mongul no doubt gave the Mercies bad gas, the scene cuts away to the Mercies planet where Mongul has dragged himself from out of the ground, escaping death and leaving the planet with his severed arm in his hand.</p><p>Morro the crypt keeper of Oa delivers a moving eulogy to Bzzd who defeated Mongul at the price of his own life. With reverence and respect for his fallen comrade Morro encased Bzzd body in a crystal, which he then shattered, leaving a perfect replica Bzzd to stand in honor amongst his fellow fallen Lanterns.</p><p>Morro is shocked to find the Lantern Saarek meditating amongst the dead. Saarek claims that he is there at the dead’s invitation. He tells Morro that he can speak to the dead and that they are frightened over the coming darkness. Informing Morro that his dead brother Morg sends his respects and is praying for his safety, Saarek leaves the crypts disturbed by the dead’s warnings.</p><p>On the planet Citcra Tana a Lantern banner is proudly hung outside the family home of rookie Lantern <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56891\" href=\"/zevonn-parzzx/4005-56891/\">Zevonn Parzzx</a>. A dog-like creature jumps up in alarm and is quickly killed in a blast of energy. Inside the Parzzx family is startled by the arrival of an unseen stranger who asks if someone in the family serves the Corps. When Zevonn's mother stats that her son “proudly serves” the family is asked if they will “proudly die” and are slaughtered by the unseen stranger.</p><p>Back at Warriors, Guy discovers Kyle's drawing in the trash and is shocked to see a doodle of a Green Lantern dying in agony, his body torn in half.</p><p>Unaware of his family’s murder, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-56891\" href=\"/zevonn-parzzx/4005-56891/\">Zevonn Parzzx</a> and his fellow rookies are on a nearby Oan moon training under Kilowog and Rayner. The senior Lanterns are joined by Soranik Natu who flirts with Rayner in the first sign of a burgeoning relationship. The two discuss the many marriage proposals Natu has received from her patients at the hospital with Kyle remarking that such intense feelings can develop between soldiers on the battlefield as well.</p><p>Their flirting is interrupted by what appears to be rain, however upon closer inspection the Lanterns discover that they are being showered with the eye balls of dozens of murder victims. Natu uses her ring to analyze one of the eyes, revealing that it came from Zevonn's mother. The young Lantern breaks down in despair as Kyle orders his ring to analyze the remaining organic matter. The eyes were torn from family member of Green Lanterns throughout the universe and rained down upon them in a twisted warning.</p><p>As Kilowog comforts the grief stricken rookies, Saarek arrives and uses his power to commune with the dead in a unique way. Drawing the last image seen by these eyes, Saarek’s ring reveals the face of the killer and the Lantern Corps newest public enemy number one.</p>",
