In which we see the return of rogue Cibopath Mason Savoy, a double agent is revealed and a narrative dirty trick is played upon an unsuspecting readership. Plus: what the deal with all those fricken chogs?</em></p><p>The issue opens up with a flashback on how Savoy convinced Caesar to work as an undercover agent for Montero -- ultimately finding out his connection with the Avian Flu. Back in the present, Tony is bringing flowers to Amelia while a annoyed John Colby talks about his, and Tony's, sex life. When they eventually do arrive at Amelia's office, she gives them a can of Poultplus -- a food that taste exactly like chicken. When Tony tries the Poultplus he realizes it isn't chicken, but fricken! At Montero's estate, Montero is discussing to Caesar that genetically altering a frog's DNA to taste like a chicken was his best plan yet.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2635911-chew_013_024end.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2635911\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.1047542304593\" data-width=\"1241\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2635911-chew_013_024end.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2635911\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2635911-chew_013_024end.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62058/2635911-chew_013_024end.jpg 1241w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62058/2635911-chew_013_024end.jpg 960w, https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62058/2635911-chew_013_024end.jpg 868w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" data-width=\"868\"></a></figure><p>As the conversation continues, Caesar mentions Montero would be arrested if the F.D.A. ever find out about his science experiment. An angered Montero tells Caesar that he is just a body guard and should remember his place, Caesar is about to kill Montero, however the F.D.A. bust in and attack. Caesar then knocks out Montero to tell Tony and John (whom arrived with the other F.D.A. agents) that he has been in deep cover to unlock Montero's secrets of his connection with the Avian Flu. Back at the F.D.A. office, Tony is yelled at by Mike Applebee that he should have asked his permission before he attacked Montero's estate and also Caesar stops being an undercover agent and is placed as a field agent. In the end, Tony had an ideal to set a trap for Savoy at Montero's estate, however Tony had a date with Amelia. John told Tony that he would cover for him and would call if he caught Savoy, that same night, Savoy had fallen into the trap set for him!</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The first cover is a homage and a parody of the movie <em>Pulp Fiction</em>.</li><li>The second cover is a homage and a parody of the movie <em>Reservoir Dogs</em>.<br /><br /></li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>RODIMUS might be impulsive, but he’s not stupid. The last anyone saw of him, he was rocketing off Earth in disgrace and a stolen ship. In this issue we finally see where he went, what his plan was, and which long-absent DECEPTICONS he came up against. Mike Costa and fan-favorite artist Nick Roche deliver a stand-alone issue that sets up the entire second year of the hit ongoing series.</i></p><p>Continuing off from the events of Transformers issue 6 and 7, Rodimus stole Ultra Magnus' ship to escape from Earth and was assumed a coward by the other Autobots. While Rodimus is piloting the ship, he's thinking to himself about how he's planning on making a single-handed headlong attack on the Decepticons' base. Meanwhile, the Decepticons at the base find his craft coming towards their base and so they shoot it down. Before the ship is struck, Rodimus hides inside of the armory which is made of an osmium alloy nothing short of Omega Supreme could penetrate. The ship is blown to pieces which then crash into the Decepticon base. Bombshell alerts Starscream of the incident and how the debris from the ship crashed into their defense perimeter and disabled it. Starscream just sits their thinking Bombshell should handle it. Bombshell looks at Starscream and thinks that the matrix is doing something to him and attempts to take it from him but Starscream knocks his hand away and tells him to leave. Meanwhile, Rodimus survived in the armory and as he comes out, he takes the weapons with him. The Decepticons are scouting around the wreckage hoping to find something and they find the armory empty with its door missing when they are attacked by Rodimus. Bombshell throws one of his probes at Rodimus but he was using the door of the armory as a vest so he is protected from it and then he takes Bombshell down. At that point, Rodimus is attacked by Razorclaw and Rodimus shoves Bombshell's probe into his mouth and tells him to get off and finds, to his surprise, that he does. He realizes he's being mind-controlled and uses it to his advantage by having him go and surprise attack Starscream. Though Starscream easily takes Razorclaw down, Rodimus then appears and tells Starscream to drop the Matrix or he'll shoot it. Starscream things he wouldn't do such a thing, but Rodimus tells him he doesn't know him very well as he shoots the Matrix causing it to electrify Starscream and knock him out. Rodimus was surprised it actually worked and then takes the Matrix. He manages to avoid contact with other Decepticons and feels confident in himself that destiny is putting everything into place and that he'll be able to change everything when he returns with the Matrix. All he feels he needs now is a way to get off of the base and return but as he's thinking that destiny cannot be stopped, he turns around to find a newly awakened Megatron with new armor. He puts the Matrix in front of his face and tells Megatron to stay back but Megatron blasts him with his fusion cannon and sends him flying off of the asteroid and out into space. Soundwave arrives and asks Megatron if everything is alright and Megatron says that it is and that now that Starscream has lost the Matrix, he wants all Decepticons to assemble in the main room so he can address his followers. He then says that there is now nothing that can stop them and Rodimus' heavily damaged body is seen floating out in space offline.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Good grief, Charlie Brown, we're halfway there! That’s right! With this volume, <b>The Complete Peanuts</b> reaches the halfway point of Charles M. Schulz’s astounding half-century run on the greatest comic strip of all time.</i></p><p><i>These years are especially fecund in terms of new canine characters, as Snoopy is joined by his wandering brother Spike (from Needles), his beloved sister Belle (from Kansas City), and... did you know he had a nephew? In other beagle news, Snoopy breaks his foot and spends six weeks in a cast, deals with his friend Woodstock’s case of the “the vapors,” and gets involved in a heated love triangle with Linus over the girl “Truffles.”</i></p><p><i><b>The Complete Peanuts 1975-1976</b> features several other long stories, including a rare “double track” sequence with two parallel narratives: Peppermint Patty and Snoopy travel to participate in the Powderpuff Derby, while Charlie Brown finally gets to meet his idol Joe Shlabotnik. And Peppermint Patty switches to a private school, but commits the mistake of allowing Snoopy to pick it for her; only after graduation does she realize something’s not quite right!</i></p><p><i>Plus: A burglary at Peppermint Patty’s house is exacerbated by waterbed problems... Marcie acquires an unwanted suitor... Charlie Brown and Peppermint Patty become desk partners... The talking school building collapses... Lots of tennis jokes... and gags starring Schroeder, Lucy, Franklin, Rerun, Sally, and that vicious cat next door. It’s another two years of <b>Peanuts</b> at its finest! Featuring an introduction by comedian Robert Smigel (Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, <b>Saturday Night Live</b>).</i></p>",
