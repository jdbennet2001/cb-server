He has taken it upon himself to assemble the six gems so that no one else will yield the power. At a secret meeting with the Illuminati, he reveals that he now possesses three of the gems. With each gem, the risks of finding the next one become greater. He convinces the Illuminati that they must track down the rest of the gems to prevent them falling into another's hands.</p> <p>Professor X, Doctor Strange, and Namor go after the Mind Gem, while Reed, Iron Man, and Black Bolt go after the Reality Gem. After some near casulties, both teams are successful.</p> <p>With the five gems in the Gauntlet, the Time Gem appears. It has been summoned by the other gems. The others tell Reed to remove the Gauntlet but he hesitates. Then Uatu, the Watcher appears stating his disappointment in Richards. No man is meant to possess that amount of power. Reed then says he tried to will the Gauntlet to cease to exist.</p> <p>Reed begs Uatu to take the Gauntlet. He says he cannot. Reed then decides that each of them shall take and hide one of hte Gems.

He tells him his plan for Roland.</p><p>Meanwhile Marten Broadcloak informs the Crimson King that Roland has not been exiled or killed. The Crimson King tells Marten that he must end Roland's life before he can fulfill what has been foretold about him end them. Then three guardsman enter Marten's room to arrest him for being a traitor. Marten replies with turning them all into dogs. Knowing that his time in Gilead is over, he draws a door on the wall and departs Gilead.</p><p>Roland, Cuthbert, and Alain prepare to leave Gilead themselves. They are given new names and are told to hide their guns. As they venture out to the next town, Hambry, they are to determine if the folk are following Farson's rule. Roland is to seek out Pat Delgado, a drover for the Barony of Mejis. He is also to keep an eye out for one of Maerlyn's spheres and is not to use it if found.

The authorities still have no idea where the giant crop circles in the shape of footprints or the alligator creatures came from. Billy notices that the treads on the footprints match his shoes. He wishes he had listened to Captain Marvel's warning about climbing the Rock of Eternity. Dr. Sivana, head of the Department of Technology and Heartland Security promises he will get to the bottom of the monster phenomenon. Billy sees an ad for the circus that is in town with its Monster Society of Evil act. He decides to go check it out.</p><p>He catches a news conference with Dr. Sivana telling the people that they will get to the bottom of this mystery. Ducking out, he sees a swarm of ants all going in the same direction. Then he stumbles into Lagreen and a friend of his. Lagreen is still demanding that Billy pay him to live on \"his\" street. Running away, he makes his way and sneaks into the circus. Lagreen follows just as the Monster Society of Evil act begins.</p><p>The act is going wrong as the alligators eat the announcer. They begin to speak to the crowd. They do not want to eat everyone...just the children. As they grab a child, Billy notices that it is his sister that he saw in the vision at the Rock of Eternity. He says \"Shazam!\" and is transformed into Captain Marvel.</p><p>As Captain Marvel fights the alligators, a talking tiger walks up. He reveals that he is not on the side of the alligators. The alligators ask him what will their leader, Mr. Mind, say. The tiger responds that he doesn't work for Mr. Mind.</p><p>With all the alligators defeated and locked up, Captain Marvel notices that the tiger has disappeared along with Billy's sister. Rushing outside, he sees an enormous creature that calls out to him. It says it is Mr. Mind and is there because of Captain Marvel. It came from beyond. He wants to remove all traces of civilization from this world. Captain Marvel tries to defeat Mr. Mind but is unable.</p><p>Flying off to find Billy's sister, he finds her by the water front with the tiger. It turns out the tiger is Talky Tawny, who Billy used to run errands for. Talky also works for Shazam and has been helping Billy adjust to his new life. Mary asks to live with him. She reveals that she doesn't have any parents either and ran away from her foster mother.</p><p>Two creatures now can be seen. Billy finally agrees that it is up to him to clean up his own mess. Transforming again, a stray bolt of lightning hits Mary and sends her smashing into a parked car. Rushing to the car, they find little Mary okay and dressed in a costume similar to Captain Marvel's. She is also able to fly just like him. Captain Marvel now has to keep her under control and defeat the two creatures.</p>",

It's the 1700's and the last person you want playing Cyrano on your side is Helmut Zemo...but that's exactly what he has to do in order to save the Zemo lineage! In the present, a major revelation about Wendell Volker's research for his \"Book of Zemo\" casts his agenda in a very different light...will he be Helmut's savior...or his executioner?</em></p><p>Zemo continues to travel through time. When the alien gemstones were destroyed, a temporal vortex was created. He now understands that it sent him back in time and he is slowly making his way forward along his family lineage. Since his time with Heller (last issue), Zemo has also been to 1556, 1640, and 1710. Judging from the growth of the trees at Zemo Keep, he guesses that several decades have passed. Seeing a young couple, Zemo discovers that the man is Hilliard Zemo, eighth in line and that he must be in the early 1760s. He also realizes that the girl Hilliard is with, named Elsbeth, is not his future wife.</p><p>In the present, Wendell Volker continues his research for his thesis paper on the Zemo lineage. He is visiting with an ancestor of Elsbeth. She was unaware that her family was nearly destroyed by the Zemos. Elsbeth was in love with a Zemo but their relationship was forbidden because she ws Jewish.</p><p>Zemo tries to tell the young couple how foolish they are for a love that is destined to not happen. Later he makes his way into town and purchases a new outfit to fit with the time. He witnesses the delivery of a message that the current Baron has been killed in battle. Hilliard becomes the new Baron. He soon is told about a new reform that will give the Jews and peasant payment from his family coffer. Meeting with Elsbeth, he asks her to leave and convince her entire family to leave. He says if they stay, his family will be crushed and his lineage will end. She then tells him that his lineage is inside her.</p><p>Zemo continues struggling trying to remember what occurs at this point in history. He soon realizes that Elsbeth family is about to be slaughtered. Making his way there on foot, he is only able to save her. He tells her to leave and never come back. The only way her seed will survive is if she keeps it as far away from Zemo Keep as possible. Hilliard never knew that she survived.</p><p>In the present, Elsbeth's ancestor is shocked to hear of this account. Her family never knew of it. She asks if Volker has any proof that she was pregnant with Zemo's child. Volker says he doesn't have anything concrete. His way to verify the theory is to shoot her with a gun found in the rubble where Zemo disappeared. He says the gun and her blood will bring Zemo back.</p>",

He keeps reminding himself, she's only seventeen. They are searching for the Book of Destiny that has been stolen. They arrive on the planet Ventura (which is basically one giant casino) as Batman follows a lead on Earth. It seems the planet has strict security measures and also don't like Green Lanterns' presence.

Supergirl continues with her flirting until Hal has to finally put his foot down. Supergirl appears hurt and takes off. Suddenly in the combat arena, she appears dressed as a little girl and is the challenger in the next fight. As Supergirl fights a huge creature with no problem, Hal checks out the wager data on that match. There is only one gambler betting on Supergirl because he \"knows\" the outcome. By the time Hal gets there, the gambler is already gone. Trying to make a get-away, he checks the book and sees himself get struck from behind. Another gambler liberates the book from him after he overheard Hal and Supergirl discussing it. It turns out this alien is in the Rannian Rebel Underground trying to get funds for the Rann-Thanagar War. He prepares to zeta-beam out of there so Hal and Supergirl have to take their fight to Rann. As Hal is \"holding\" the rebel, they beam out of there before Supergirl can grab hold of him. She is left there with no idea how to get to Rann or Earth. All the betters in the arena see her \"S\" logo and yell that she was a ringer in the fight. Things do not look too good for her.</p>",

Not knowing this, or caring (at that moment), he separates the Centurions far from the innocents and then blasts them with all he's got. In the aftermath, the ex-Centurions plead for their lives and promise to continue on their \"Death Squad\" path against Ravenous' favored Centurions.

After being the location of their captivity for countless millenia -- since the creation event and their capture by Galactus; the Crunch became the final resting place for Aegis and Tenebrous as it continues to expand into the Negative Zone.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>The destruction of Buffy's hometown, plus covert and powerful slayer \"cells\" around the world, add up to a new label for the Scoobies: Terrorist threat. Speaking of Sunnydale, the crater formerly known as, has opened to reveal the witch Amy, and boy is she pissed. Now: Giles, smoochies, a knife to the heart, and a big sleep. Season Eight continues.</p><p>Buffy creator Joss Whedon brings Buffy back to Dark Horse in this direct follow-up to Season Seven of the smash-hit TV series.</p><p>The tables have turned in the slayer-watcher dynamic. From the beginning it was always one slayer and hundreds of watchers to train her, guide her and finally help the next in line. Now, there is only one watcher: Giles. He trains the hundreds of slayers to work together despite their natural instinct to work alone.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buffy trains her own small group to take her down but no one can even knock her over. Andrew has his own band of slayers, seated in a circle, they hang on his every word as he uses Star Wars analogies to try to convey why they aren't allowed to use guns: \"No slayer carries a gun, ever, end of talk.\"</p><p>Dawn is still a giant. Xander tries to comfort her as she worries that Buffy hates her. Something is becoming clear, though. Dawn feels abandoned by her powerful sister. She allowed herself to be super-sized in order to get attention from the busy Chief Slayer.</p><p>As she fights to train her slayers, keep Dawn from feeling abandoned and her own feelings of guilt over it all, Buffy is about to meet with a sinister and very dangerous military organisation. The strange symbol from the first issue turns up again, this time on the chest of the General who seems hell bent on destroying the slayers.</p><p>While walking Buffy to her room, Xander expresses his concerns over Dawn's destructive tendencies. They reach her door and (shock of shock) Buffy invites him in, promising to be gentle. As she kisses him, his head pops right across the room! The world gets stranger as she's sucked out of her window into the waiting jaws of a dragon.</p><p>It's all a dream though. Amy has bewitched the chief slayer and she stands over her prone body, knife in hand, ready to deal out her revenge. It's Xander to the rescue with his band of slayers. After all, why would they allow Buffy to sleep without protecting her with magic? Amy's knife splits down the middle and Buffy is fine... and yet she slumbers on.</p><p>Amy has had the last laugh. She has cast a spell on Buffy, trapping her in a nightmare world, only to be awoken by true love's kiss. As Xander puzzles over what this could mean and the nuances of \"true love\", the castle is attacked by an army of mindless zombies. The slayers leap into action but nothing will stop these rotting corpses.</p><p>As Amy leans out of the window to gloat, her laughter dies on her lips as a familiar voice lets her know, there's no laugh like the laugh of a witch. Enter Willow, stage right!</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Venom is back in town, and he's on a rampage...but it has nothing to do with his vendetta against Spidey? What could be so important that Venom doesn't have the time to torture his nemesis? Peter Parker is determined to find out, but first he'll have to match journalistic wits with none other than Eddie Brock! Plus a new backup tale by Paul Benjamin &amp; Vasilis Lolos, featuring the Lizard! And fresh from Japan…Spider-Man J! Printed for the first time in America and translated for your reading pleasure! AND…classic tales from Amazing Spider-Man #177 and #347! That enough Spidey for ya?</em></p><p>Venom (Eddie Brock) attempts to murder a rich businesswoman, Ione Damasco, and is stopped by Spider-Man. Rather than fight him, Venom does something different. He tells Spider-Man to mind his own business and leaves. The woman, rather than thankful for having her life saved, goes off on Spider-Man. When he tries to find out why Venom would be after her, the police arrive. Now it is Spider-Man's turn to leave.</p><p>The next morning over breakfast, Peter decides that Venom needs to be put away for good. He hates the fact that Venom has terrorized Mary Jane. He heads over to the Daily Bugle to ask Ben Urich if he knows anything about Venom's attack on the businesswoman. Ben doesn't know. When Peter asks about the names of other businessmen that was mentioned, Ben tells him that one of them could be a CEO that was suffocated in his home the past week. Peter then goes down to the Bugle's morgue to look over the paper's archives. Finally he finds an article with the three names (and others). Another businessman was mauled to death two weeks ago. Peter now wonders why Eddie Brock is after these people.</p><p>Ione is in her apartment surrounded by hired guards. When she goes to be alone in her room, she finds another guard in there. It turns out to be Brock in disguise. The next day, it's reported that she's dead. Peter returns to the Bugle to tell Ben that he's found the connection. The list of names he's compiled has over twenty names on it. Ben insists that Peter hands over the information to the police and avoid Venom at all costs.</p><p>Continuing his search for a connection with Venom and the others, Peter finally recieves a tip. Paying a visit to one of the businessmen, Spider-Man confronts him over what he's done. They were working on a hair growth drug. Pressed for time, they began testing it on unwilling transients. Because so many were killed, Venom is after them for vengeance. Finally Spider-Man asks how they were able to keep reporter Eddie Brock quiet.</p><p>Just then, Venom arrives. He tells Spider-Man that first they try a bribe. Then they say they've hired a hit man to kill your wife. The two begin to fight. As they smash around the place, an electrical fire begins. The fire causes Venom to have to flee since his symbiote hates fire. Peter saves the businessman but delivers him to the police. Ben is able to write the story (with the research notes from Eddie Brock). Venom is somewhat pleased. But he says he is not finished with Spider-Man just yet.</p><p>Dr. Curt Connors checks in on his star grad student to find out about his \"secret experiment.\" Connors notices that the machinery he's working on is similar to a genetic replicator. The nervous student explains that it replaces genes that are switched off in one species with active ones from another. As the student rushes to the door to pay for his dinner, Curt notices lizards in a cage. Outraged, he tells the student that he has no idea what he's getting himself into. The student replies that he knows Connors' secret. Connors is baffled as to why he would continue working on an experiment that turned himself into a monster. He begins destroying the lab. The reptile cage is damaged and Connors transforms into the Lizard.</p><p>The Lizard tries to kill the student but he fights back. The student says that he won't let him destroy his work when he is so close to finding a cure. The Lizard and the student are thrown back. The student falls into the smashed replicator (that happens to have one of the lizards in it) and there is an explosion.</p><p>Curt awakes, back to normal but saddened over what has happened to his student. The paramedics arrive to take the student away who now has the mind of reptile himself. As they leave, none notices a pinned lizard amidst the wreckage that can speak and asks Dr. Connors for help.</p><p>Flash Thompson is thrown from a window by the new Green Goblin. Determined not to allow someone else close to him die, Spider-Man rushes to the window, snags Flash with a web, and puts him safely on the roof. The Goblin pushes Spider-Man out. He manages to catch the side of the building with a web and swings down to street level. He is unable to stop himself as he heads towards a driving car. He avoids causing injuries by smashing through the back doors of the car. The driver is enraged and tries to start a fight with Spider-Man. Spider-Man apologizes and leaves. As the man drives away, he smashes into another car.</p><p>Spider-Man goes back to talk to Flash and see if he's okay. Flash is stunned over the recent events. At first he thought Harry was acting out his Goblin fantasies by dressing up as him. But this time the voice was different and he was way stronger than Harry. Harry is also missing. Spider-Man has to leave as the sound of police sirens approach. Spider-Man wants Flash to continue to believe this is the case. (No one knows that this is actually another Green Goblin).</p><p>In an abandoned warehouse, the Green Goblin talks to a hooded individual that is tied up. It is his plans to become the crime boss of all of New York. He says he's covered the face of the individual because he couldn't stand to look at his snivelling face. He does thank him for their psychiatric sessions. He leaves because he has discovered a meeting that night with the top criminals in the city.</p><p>Peter visits Aunt May in the hospital. She seems to be doing better after her attack the day before. He leaves when Mary Jane and her aunt arrive to look after her.</p><p>Deep in thoughts over the Green Goblin and all the misery he's caused him, Peter stumbles across a gangland execution. The killers are all knocked out but he finds an invitation to the secret meeting after it fell out of one of their pockets. Spider-Man plans on crashing the meeting just as Aunt May has another attack in the hospital. Mary Jane tries to call him but Peter is not home.</p><p>The criminal meeting is being conducted by Silvermane. The Green Goblin crashes through the window. He says he wants control over the criminals of New York. The criminals try to stop the Goblin but he is too quick and strong for them. Once they realize they are no match, Silvermane decides to listen to the Goblin. He tells them that he can stop the one superhero that has caused them the most problems. He says he knows who Spider-Man really is. Spider-Man is listening in an air duct and knows that he is about to be finished if the Goblin reveals his identity.</p><p>Spider-Man awakes to find himself on an island with Venom. Venom says that their fights were always interrupted by outsiders. As Eddie Brock, he chartered a plane to bring him to a deserted island. There used to be a mining activity on the island but a disaster destroyed the mine and all the people eventually left. Spider-Man shoots Venom in the face with webbing and takes off.</p><p>Venom rips off the webbing, begins singing the theme to Giligan's Island, and prepares for the hunt. After swinging some ways across the island, Spider-Man stops for a drink at a pond only to discover Venom, using his chameleon powers, in the water as he pulls him under.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, Mary Jane is at her sister's wathing over her nephews. Peter sent her there to keep her safe from Venom. When she is pelted in the face by a snowball, she goes off on them but soon gathers her wits. She tries to be strong for Peter and helps her nephews with their snowman.</p><p>Back on the island, the battle continues underwater. Peter manages to grab a piece of wood and hits Venom across the face, smashing some of his teeth. This allows Peter to escape again. He finds an abandoned village near a graveyard. He tries to set a trap and waits for Venom, who has managed to sneak up on him since he doesn't trigger his spider-sense.</p><p>The snare-rope Peter rigged slows down Venom briefly. Peter falls into a mine shafts and smells gas. Peter runs again. He sets up another trap as Eddie Brock sits in front of a fire. Peter grabs a piece of flaming wood from the fire and Venom gives chase. After walking into a string of web, Venom grabs a nearby van and throws it at the flaming glow in the distance as Spider-Man tries to escpae. There is a big explosion as Venom remembers the gas. He finds the tattered remains of Spider-Man's costume on a skeleton and is pleased that Spider-Man is now dead.</p><p>Meanwhile Peter swims out to a nearby ship as Eddie decides to stay on the island now that Spider-Man is gone. He believes there is no longer a reason for Venom to exist.</p><p>A manga adventure of Spider-Man J helping SWAT Detective Flynn defeate the eveil Wasperus.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>ULTRON IS BACK and, yes, now he's a she. What?? Ultron's a girl?? It’s Ultron as only Frank Cho can bring it. And the Mighty Avengers haven't had a moment to get to know each other before they are thrown into one of the most epic adventures in the history of the Avengers.</em></p><p>66 minutes before the Mole Man attack</p><p>Simon Williams is talking to his agent. His agent is trying to sell him on doing a reality tv show that focuses on what a super-hero's life is like. Simon doesn't want to do a reality show. He wants to be a serious actor. His agent mentions that he's famous because he was a \"%@#&amp;$ Avenger.\" Simon doesn't want to be a sellout and use his status as a former Avenger to further his career. His agent doesn't think it's possible for him to move beyond that image especially after the Civil War. Outside the window, Ms. Marvel and Iron Man arrive. Ms. Marvel tells him that he could just <strong>be</strong> an Avenger because \"movies suck.\"</p><p>The present, moments after Iron Man morphed into a silver-skinned woman.</p><p>Ms. Marvel thinks to herself that she's only been leading the Avengers for two minutes and she's already in over her head. She calls out \"Tony?\" and the woman responds, \"Not Tony.\" She seems to know all the Avengers there. She's tapping into some computer files on everyone in the area. Ares is ready to attack. Ms. Marvel holds him back saying they don't know the full situation. She thinks to herself that he's gotta go when this situation is over.</p><p>Wasp asks if anyone thinks this woman looks like her but with \"worse hair.\" Mole Man is upset that this woman is responsible for what happened to his underground home. She says yes, it was collateral damage. He orders his \"children\" to attack her. Ms. Marvel is concerned that Tony is \"in there\" and tells Sentry they have to save him.</p><p>55 minutes before the Mole Man attack, Sentry's Watchtower</p><p>Bob is sitting with his wife. She asks what he's thinking. He says that he's not sure what he's supposed to be doing. He says that there's so many things going on in the city alone that The Sentry could do something about. Lindy is bothered that he referred to The Sentry as if he were a different person, again. She says perhaps he should talk to his therapist about it. Bob says it's all they talk about. Iron Man and Ms. Marvel arrive saying they've put together a new team of Avengers. At the news of this, Lindy gets up and walks out of the room. Ms. Marvel tells Bob that she's scared of him. She says she needs to know that she can count on him and that he'll tell her when things start getting screwy in his head.</p><p>The present</p><p>Sentry is just standing there. Ares gets tired of just waiting and moves to attack. Carol feels she has no choice but to follow with the attack. Sentry and Ares are seemingly struck by lightning. The woman is talking to Mole Man about Reed Richards paper on cloning and perhaps he should consider it for his creatures (and hopes he's not involved with any of them). She lets off a wave of energy and they are destroyed. Mole Man cries out over his \"babies.\"</p><p>Sentry feels he can take her. Ares wants to kill her. Carol says she wants to try something else. She tries to talk to the women, introducing herself. Black Widow has the women in her site with her sniper rifle. The woman tells Carol she knows who she is.</p><p>22 minutes before the Mole Man attack on board a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier</p><p>Black Widow is in a physical training room. She is \"training\" three different agents. She's actually mopping the floor with them. She seems angry. Iron Man and Ms. Marvel arrive. He says it's not their fault that she's not in the field. He then gives her the good news that she's an Avenger again.</p><p>The present</p><p>Ares so badly wants to attack the woman. Carol tells him to stay which causes the woman to respond, \"good dog.\" This enrages Ares even more. Sentry and Wonder Man do their best to hold him back. The woman asks if he's the real Ares, God of War. When he says yes, she tells him she likes Thor better.</p><p>Ares lunges with his battle axe. There seems to be quite the force field around her. His blade gets bent and his shaft breaks. Next he gets hit by a lightning bolt. He tries to get up to attack again only to get hit again. Sentry has to swoop in to get him out of there.</p><p>The woman notes that it's going to take a lot to take out Sentry. He asks where Iron Man is. She responds that it's clear that they don't get what is happening to them but she will be ready for him in a few minutes. Carol orders a retreat, much to Ares dismay. She tells him they are in no position to deal with her. They need more information as to how to take her down. She also says that if he defies her orders again, she will have him off the team and the planet. As Carol talks to Ares, Wasp looks at the woman.</p><p>14 minutes before the Mole Man attack, the Van Dyne Design Studio, SOHO</p><p>Janet declines a phone call from Hank. Carol is looking over a couple of Janet's designs. Janet isn't too pleased with either of them. Carol tells her she could always just become an Avenger again. Janet says she told herself she wasn't going to use the Avengers to hide from her problems in life. Carol is able to convince her that it doesn't have to be like that, she'll just be doing what she can to make the world a better place.</p><p>The present</p><p>Wasp approaches the woman. Carol thinks she'll kill her. Wasp is fine with that but doesn't think that will happen. She knows there's some sort of connection between them. Wasp asks if she's Tony. No. She asks if she's Iron Man. No. She asks why she looks just like her. \"Because I love you.\"</p><p>Wasp goes back to the others asking if anyone knows where her ex-husband is. When they ask her why, she says because Ultron is back and it's destroying the world. And it's killed Tony.</p>",

Adam Strange, Animal Man, and Starfire disappeared. Firestorm and Cyborg fused together. Red tornado blew up. And Supergirl was lost in time. She has returned, changed.</p><p><i>Week 50, Day 4</i></p><p>J'onn is still out in space trying to regroup after his confrontation with Black Adam. He observes several different incidents on Earth. Supergirl approaches him with, what he notes, a darkness choking her heart. She passes through him which causes J'onn pain and she passes out, falling to Earth. Landing in Metropolis, Supergirl is unconscious in a big crater.</p><p>J'onn tries dealing with the pain of the images of death in his mind. He tries to focus and looks back to Earth to try to find something to anchor onto.</p><p>In Gotham City, Harvey Dent is fighting Killer Croc after Croc was about to eat a girl. Dent comments on how Batman's gone and he's keeping Gotham clean now. Grabbing a broken bottle, he jams it into Croc's head. Moving around back of Croc, Dent grabs him around the neck to cause him to pass out.</p><p>Watching this fight on the rooftop is Batgirl and Deathstroke. Deathstroke asks her how does it feel to see that when Batman left, he didn't ask her to take care of Gotham. He comments how Batman trusts Harvey Dent over her. He says Batman is just keeping her close because he knows what she is and was born to be. He says they all need a place to belong. She knows where to find him once she makes her decision.</p><p>Martian Manhunter feels Harvey trying to convince himself that he didn't enjoy the pain he cause Killer Croc. He's disgusted over Deathstroke playing with Batgirl's feelings of abandonment to try to turn her. He is still confused with all the thoughts in his head. J'onn tries to find a reason why he should continue to care.</p><p>In Pisa, Italy, the Doom Patrol is getting demolished by Black Adam. Booster Gold appears saying it's not the right time, he's too early and disappears. Robotman gets his head knocked off by Adam.</p><p>In Sydney, Australia, Donna Troy, in Wonder Woman's garb, is distressed over the destruction. She notes that there isn't much she can do there. She plans on heading to Pisa to see what lies there. She contacts Beast Boy to tell him to be careful with his team. They are all young and too many innocents have been killed already.</p><p>In Sub Diego, Aquaman has summoned the water gods to find out why the human inhabitants suddenly can no longer breathe underwater. They laugh at him and his talk of war against them if they do not help. He mentions that his friends are not limited to just the ocean. They agree to give him the power to save the city but there will be a price. He will be transformed into \"one akin to a great and terrible enemy\" of his people. The city is raised, the people are saved, and Aquaman is transformed. J'onn notes that Aquaman's mind is now lost, perhaps forever.</p><p>J'onn sees other events occuring. He sees Donna Troy helping to save innocents trapped in rubble, people mourning the death of others, Black Adam still on his rampage, the young Teen Titans preparing to fight, Captain Marvel, Jr. trying to get up after getting beaten down, and an old man fighting his fear to try to help the unconscious Supergirl still in the crater. J'onn starts to remeber human emotions such as love, hate, good, evil, hope, despair, etc. These aspects of human nature is what he struggled with when he first arrived. He now realizes that if he is to continue to live among humans, he has to stop this destruction.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>One year ago, Dick Grayson pledged his heart to Barbara Gordon, a.k.a. Oracle, then nearly surrendered his life during the INFINITE CRISIS. Now, learn the full comeback story of Nightwing as it brings to light the story of DC's most star-crossed couple in a stunning annual by fan favorites Marc Andreyko (MANHUNTER) and Joe Bennett (52).</p><p>A year ago during the final days of the Infinite Crisis at Gotham International Airport, Dick Grayson proposes to Barbara Gordon. He is about to leave to save the universe and doesn't know if he's going to return. He lost Barbara once and doesn't want to do so again.</p><p>In Metropolis, Nightwing fights along side Batman against Alex Luthor, Deathstroke, and others. Nightwing is hit by a blast from Alex. Wonder Woman carries him to \"some place safe\" and Dr. Mid-Nite works to save him. He sees Barbara by his side and suddenly, she is pulled away. Nightwing jumps up to save her when he is attacked by a zombie Batman and upper torso of Deathstroke. He is told he is in Hell. He fights his way against others and finally sees the Joker about to shoot Barbara when he awakes.</p><p>Dick is in bed, bandage up, with Barbara next to him. He says he needs to get to Blüdhaven to help. Barbara tells him that the Crisis is over. She gives him a chocolate malt from the place they had their first date. He's been in a coma for three weeks.</p><p>Flashback to their first date. Dick and Barbara skip patrol as Robin and Batgirl in order to get a bite to eat. Their date is cut short by a passing police car. They fought against Crazy Quilt as he tries to rob a bank. Crazy Quilt surprises them by using his hypno-helmut on them and locks them in the safe. Batgirl asks why he wears pixie boots and short pants. Robin says it creates the illusion that he's just a kid which gives him an extra element of surprise. Robin notices that Batgirl smells really nice. Then the safe is pulled from the back of the truck being driven by Crazy Quilt as Batman managed to snag it with a line from the Batmobile. Robin tries to think clean thoughts as he finds himself having to hide a certain bodily reaction with his cape after being so close to Batgirl.</p><p>Time goes by and Dick is trying to get himself back in shape before he was blasted. Barbara admits she heard Robin's confession of love many years ago when he thought she was asleep. She didn't acknowledge it because so much was going on. Robin and Batman were having problems and the Teen Titans had reformed. After giving it some time and thought, she was ready to be with Dick. Going to his apartment, his door is answered by a barely dressed Starfire. She never told Dick that she came by since he was in the shower at the time.</p><p>When Barbara was shot by the Joker, Dick was away on Tamaran. He didn't find out what had happened until six months later. He showed up at her place. They embraced each other. One thing led to another and they ended up in bed. The next morning as Dick is getting dressed, he hands Barbara an envelope. Inside is an engagement announcement for him and Kory. Outraged, she yells at him to get out.</p><p>They both continue to apologize to each other and Nightwing continues to train himself. Dick and Barbara are trying to put the past behind them in order to have a future when Bruce calls. He tells Dick that he and Tim are going away on a long trip and he wants Dick to join them. Bruce says that after the Crisis, he needs to remember why he's doing everything that he is. He needs his family with him. He says he'll give him a few days to make his decision.</p><p>Barbara tells Dick that she already knew about Bruce's request. He had called her earlier to see how Dick was doing and if she thought he should go. She told him yes. She gives him back the engagement ring and says he needs to make an honest decision.</p><p>The next morning, Dick finds himself alone. Barbara left him a note saying that they both know he has to go with Bruce. She says she loves the man he is and needs him to be happy with himself too. He spent his whole life trying to figure out who he was. She needs him to figure out who is Dick Grayson.</p><p>As he boards a ship with Bruce and Tim, Barbara finds a note in her place. Enclosed is a photo of Robin and Batgirl and the ring on a necklace. There is a note too that says no matter what, he will always love her and he will return to her. She says to herself that she's going to hold him to that promise.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Join War Machine and the Gauntlet as they lead the Initiative's fresh faced recruits and a division of Marvel's finest fliers against the forces of Hydra. All this and a pivotal moment in the life of Yellowjacket.</em></p><p>The trainees are running an obstacle course at Camp Hammond, in Stamford Cennecticut. Gauntlet orders them to run it without using their powers. Justice is bothered at his continued use of \"The New Warriors\" as an insult to what they should be. When talk among the trainees turns to what happens if you don't \"make it\" here, she starts thinking about MVP and how he's dead. She can't help thinking about him. Trauma is close by and his powers begin to take action over her fears. His body turns into the dead MVP, with half his head missing.</p><p>Hank runs to deal with Trauma and tells Justice to calm the trainees down but any talk about MVP is off limits. Justice is not happy with being left out of the loop over him, he still has no idea what happened. As Hank yells at Trauma over what he just did, he tries to explain that it was her fears that made him change. Then he begins to sense Hank's fears. He begins to change into a beaten Janet Van Dyne. Gauntlet and Justice pull them apart. Justice says he knows of some people that can help him get his powers under control.</p><p>In Hank's office, he searches for some anxiety pills that he used in the past. He decides to call Janet. She is out on a date and Hank hangs up before she can answer her phone.</p><p>In Baron Von Blitzschlag's lab, he comments to Gyrich and Hank about MVP's body. Despite his being the grandson of Abraham Esrkine, the creator the original Super-Soldier Serum, MVP had earned his perfection by putting in hard work. Analysis of his body shows that he didn't have any super powers. Hank is disgusted over Von Blitzschlag's talk of using the body's perfect genes to try to create more soldiers. He says he can't believe that not only is he working with Gyrich, but also a former Nazi. Von Blitzschlag turns things around by mentioning Hank's creation of Ultron and the Thor clone that killed Goliath. He tells Hank not to hate him because he's his biggest fan.</p><p>Just then a Priority One emergency alert goes off. All Initiative members are being called to action. Over a no-fly zone in Texas, a Hydra terror-carrier is headed toward the Prairie Chapel Ranch, also known as the \"Western White House.\" Several groups are already on scene attempting to deal with it including the Texas Rangers with Living Lightning, Firebird, Texas Twister, Armadillo, Red Wolf, Phantom Rider, and Shooting Star.</p><p>At Camp Hammond, War Machine hands out weapons, pulse rifles, to members that can fly. Those that can't fly are given jet packs despite not having put in any time training with them. They pass throught the Negative Zone to get to the Texas jump gate. The plan is to build one for every state. Because of the affects between negative and positive space, they are to only be used in extreme emergencies.</p><p>With the Initiatives and other Avengers, they attempt to break through the shield the Hydra carrier has. Cloud 9 is surprised when she shoots down her first plane. She comments how it's not like in the cartoons. The pilot didn't jump out in a parachute when the plane was hit.</p><p>In the War Room at Camp Hammond, Trauma is brought to Gyrich. Trauma is ready to get kicked out. He says he knows this isn't where he belongs. Gyrich agrees. He says he should be out there with the others, defending his country.</p><p>Despite some injuries, they are finally able to break throught the shields. Hank jumps on the ship and begins to increase his size and mass. The ship's trajectory is changed. Hank begins to think that this could change the world's outlook on him. Perhaps now they won't just think of him as a wife beater. The ship explodes.</p><p>It turns out, Hank survived. He is honored at the White House, given the Presidential Medal of Freedom with military distinction. The trainees see that this may not be such a bad deal afterall.</p><p>At a level Trauma's never been to before by Gyrich. He asks if this is where he gets shot. Gyrich tells him that his powers are too important to just throw away since he can change shapes and read minds. They have called in a specialist. Henry McCoy, the Beast, is there to give Gyrich a big hello. Gyrich asks why the Xavier Institute sent him. He says he's there as a chaperone for the one they've requested. The mysterious female says she asked Beast to go with her for two reasons: one, she needed a bodyguard since she lost her powers after M-Day, and two, because he was dying to see him. We have to wait until next issue to see who Trauma's private tutor will be.</p>",

Now the trio of agents must track down the device, while avoiding a sexy assassin who is blocking their path…and who has been contracted to take out Abbey Chase!</em></p><p>In <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55779\" href=\"/nevada/4020-55779/\">Nevada</a>, an Army convoy is transporting a nuclear missle after the threats have been made of detonating them. They are trying to take it to a secure location. Suddenly the missle is armed and it goes off. The terroists strike again.</p><p>In <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55685\" href=\"/washington-dc/4020-55685/\">Washington D.C</a>. at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56318\" href=\"/white-house/4020-56318/\">White House</a>, the President is trying to figure out what the terrorists want. He recieves a call from the man claiming to have the Master Key. He says he can destroy all the superpowers on the planet. The General in the room makes it clear that they do not nogotiate with terrorists. They do express that they are curious as to what his demands are. The man says there is just one thing he wants from this country, the President, himself.</p><p>In Madagascar, Abbey and Sydney prepare to meet with their insider at the terrorists base. It's an M.I.6 Agent that has been running surveillance on the camp before they arrive. The bad news is that Sydney finds him, shot apparently by a sniper. He appears to have been shot the same way Naoki was (last issue).</p><p>The two <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40975\" href=\"/danger-girl/4060-40975/\">Danger Girls</a> then find themselves surrounded by camouflaged men that look to be Special Forces. As they frisk the girls, one seems to be a little more 'grabby' than the rest. The girls won't stand for that and prepare to fight them all. The men are told to stand down by one of them. It turns out to be Sydney's boyfriend, Johnny Barracuda. As they reacquaint themselves, Abbey reminds them that they are on a mission.</p><p>Back at the White House, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17807\" href=\"/deuce/4005-17807/\">Deuce</a> arrives to consult with the President. They are old friends. The President shows him an image of the man claiming to have the Master Key and Deuce identifies him as Arthur Franco. He says his girls are on their way to find him. The President says they do not have time to wait and he's going to give himself up. Deuce suggests he follow him but the President doesn't want to risk having Franco set off all the nukes.</p><p>Abbey and Sydney find a computer in one of the camp buildings. Abbey sends the hard drive's contents to Valerie to see if there's anything they can use on it. Turning on the computer inadvertently started a bomb that will go off in thirty seconds. Outside, Johnny and his men are busy with the terrorists. Just as it appears that all the information was sent, Abbey and Sydney barely escape the building. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-17826\" href=\"/silicon-valerie/4005-17826/\">Silicon Valerie</a> tells them that they got some good stuff. The President won't have to give himself up. Deuce says it might be too late for that.</p><p>On board a military plane, the President suits up to halo out. The soldier helping him asks if it's a good idea for him to jump. Once he's out, they won't be able to guarantee that they'll be able to get him out. The President asks what's more important, the man protecting the country or the country itself.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Coming home from a long time in space, Richard Rider, Nova, doesn't get the welcome he expected. His parents don't recognize him and him speaking Kree doesn't help things any. Eventually things get worked out and Richard sits down and has a meal with his mother and father. Over dinner he gets caught up on recent events, namely, the death of his former teammates, Stamford, and the Civil War. Before he can really process all of this he gets a warning from Worldmind about something outside. He walks out of his house and into the sights of SHIELD rifles and Iron Man himself.</p><p>When Iron Man sees that he's dealing with Nova (and not an alien threat like he had first thought) they both go back to a SHIELD Helicarrier to have a chat. Tony fills Richard in on the Superhero Registration Act and the Civil War and Nova reciprocates by telling him about the cosmic war that had been going on. Nova is shocked to hear that no one had gotten his messages and that Earth didn't even know what was going on. Stark turns the conversation back to Registration and asks Nova to not only register officially, but to take part in the training of young heroes. Tony says that the discipline and training of the Nova Corps are exactly what they are looking to attain and that Nova would be the perfect one to put it into action, especially with his past ties to the New Warriors. Nova says he'll think about it and goes to talk to his old friend Justice. They do some more catching up and then Nova goes home.</p><p>Back at his house, Nova tries to get some sleep. Before he does though, he asks Worldmind to try to find his old friends. Worldmind accepts the challenge and mentions that he's able to access Earth's major information networks, including SHIELD computers. While Richard is sleeping, Worldmind controls his body and tries to talk with Richard's father. This does not go well at all and Nova is booted out of his own house.</p><p>The next day, Nova is walking down the street and is attacked by Diamondhead. The criminal is really no match for Nova, but the problem comes when he tries to hand him over to the police. Nova is badgered about Registration and being a New Warrior and is all but forced out of the police station. When he walks outside he's confronted by another threat, this time it's a group. The Thunderbolts, with Penance right in the front, have business to take care of.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The invasion of Earth proceeds smoothly as no heroes can stop the process that will bring about the Silver Age of humanity! To find the key to stopping the aliens, Reed Richards leaves his planet and his team. Now with Spider-Man joining, the world still has a Fantastic Four ...but will it be enough to save the Earth?</em></p><p>Spider-Man arrives in his apartment after the aliens have arrived in Central Park. Mary Jane tells him it's all over the news. Peter tells her that he has to change his ripped uniform and head back out there. Aunt May tells him he isn't going anywhere until he eats lunch. Turning back to Mary Jane, he sees that she has been transformed into an alien-like appearance. The same has happened to Aunt May. Aunt May tells him her name is May-H'Oll now. Mary Jane tells him the change in him may take some time. She also tells him that they have joined with the humans. They are one now.</p><p>Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, along with Franklin and Valeria return to the city from their camping trip in the Fantasitcar. They set the Fantasicar on autopilot to take the kids back to the Baxter Building as they drop down into Central Park. They find the Thing and Human Torch there with the human/alien people going after them. Ben tells Reed not to hurt them as they explain that the aliens here are really Earth people. Sue puts up an invisible force field to keep them back. The people are telling them to accept the change and that it is the destiny of the human and H'Moj races. They witness the change in some other poeple and Ben explains that they cannot stop the process. Reed tries to talk to the other alien, the Imperator, that seems to be in charge of the process. He explains to Reed that he is not part of that race. He simply works for them.</p><p>Reed decides they must return to his lab. The vegetation in the park is also changing. At the Fantasticar, there is another gathering of the alien/people. Spider-Man is getting overwhelmed inside. He manages to start it up and safely knock the people out. He picks up the Fantastic Four and they head towards the Baxter Building. Reed then realizes that the kids are unprotected from the change.</p><p>Arriving at the Baxter Building, they find that the kids and Alicia have not been changed. Alicia figures that the aliens are not interested in children or the blind. On the television, the Mayor/Elder councilor of the H'Moj civilization is talking to the world. He says that Earth has been chosen out of 7,344 candidates to be the latest host for their race. The Earth's population is just over that of the H'Moj to ensure a proper merging of their race. This is to be a new Silver Age for both their people.</p><p>After watching the broadcast, Johnny asks how come they haven't all changed. Reed deduces that if there is a change in one's DNA, the change does not work. That explains why they and Franklin and Valeria haven't been changed. Reed says he is going back to his cell. Sue and Ben are going to go back to the park to see if they can do anything to prevent more changes. Sue tells Johnny and Spider-Man to go and try to rally up any superhumans.</p><p>The two head to Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorium. Before the door opens, Spidey suggests that Johnny flames on just his head. When the door opens, Spider-Man's thoughts were correct, Wong and Dr. Strange have been changed. Johnny says the change has made him more powerful and he has to stay flamed on all the time. Spidey says he is now the Silver Spider under his mask.</p><p>Around the world there are conflicts between the changed and the unchanged. The news reports say that the unchanged will not be treated as criminals but there will be consequences for getting in the way of colonization. In the park, Sue and Ben are still unable to break through the Imperator's force field.</p><p>Back at Reed's lab, things do not look too good. Johnny and Spider-Man arrive and tell him that the heroes that have been changed are not performing to their normal standards. Then Sue and Ben arrive and tell them they didn't have any more luck trying to stop the process. Reed has tried millions of simulations to try to find a way to separate the aliens from their human hosts. He hasn't found a way to do so without killing both species. Spider-Man brings up the point that they do eventually leave the planet they take over. He asks what happens to the population at that point, do they live or die. Reed says that is a good point and suggests visiting some of the planets that have been changed to see what is left.</p><p>Even though the nearest planet is millions of light years away (in Spidey's words), Reed has recently built a spaceship that jumps through black holes and the negative zone. The problem is, it's only been designed to hold one person. There is no time to make the cockpit bigger so only one person can go. The obvious choice is for Reed to go. As he is about to leave, he says that they have another \"science nerd\" in Spider-Man to take his place and gives Spider-Man a 4 emblem communicator device to wear. When Reed's ship has left, they find that the Imperator has arrived outside the Baxter Building with the backup. They plan on taking them into custody.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>The latest offering from the Marvel Knights line. Guest-starring Spider-Man! </p><p>For untold years, Norrin Radd has surfed the galaxy, exploring the darkness between stars, witnessing the rise and fall of vast civilizations. Now his ride is about to come to an end. It starts with a small spot -- a blemish that will spread until he is no more. Until then, the Silver Surfer will undertake his final voyage -- to the one destination that has always eluded him. But first, a much-needed consultation with an old friend -- Spider-Man… </p><p>Spider-Man is fighting a criminal that stole an army armored weapon that was being transported.  It is virtually indestructible and his weapon won't even stick to it.  Peter Parker was trying to buy a pair of earrings for Mary Jane's birthday when the news reported the theft.  It doesn't look too good for Spider-Man but he is not one to back away from a fight, especially when he sees a bus with potential hostages coming towards them.  He gives out one final warning for the thief to stop right before he can smash Spider-Man.</p><p>To Spider-Man's surprise, the criminal stops.  Then he notices that the guy is looking up above him.  The Silver Surfer is floating there on his board.  He tells the criminal that he was given a warning and should've listened to it.  Giving him a taste of what it's like to face the Power Cosmic, in a bright flash, the armored weapon lies in pieces in front of Spider-Man.</p><p>Spider-Man jokes to the Surfer that he almost had the criminal and just saved them a few seconds before he would've taken him down.  The Surfer just says that he was in the area and saw innocents in danger.  Spidey tries to go after him and even asks if he wants to go see a movie or something with him.  The Silver Surfer continues to go higher and higher.  Spider-Man says that it looks like something is bothering him and if he wanted to, they could talk about it.</p><p>In a flash, the Silver Surfer zooms down to Spider-Man's side, agreeing to talk.  It takes the Surfer some time to find the words to begin \"talking.\"  He finally says that he is leaving this \"adopted home\" and will never return.  When Spidey asks why, the Surfer says his reasons are his own.  Spider-Man notices a cracked blotch on the Surfer's forearm.  He tells him that if something's wrong maybe there's something he could do.  Silver Surfer tells him there isn't anything he could do.  He then tells him how he doesn't understand why the people on this world do so much to hurt each other.  He wishes there was something he could do to fix things before he left.  Spider-Man goes over some extreme scenarios that the Surfer could try that wouldn't end well.  He says that is why they fight one villain at a time.  It's easier to see what it is they are doing that is wrong.</p><p>Spider-Man then asks why he uses a surfboard.  The Surfer tells him it's not a surfboard.  He tells Spider-Man how he does not require food or air or a ship to soar through space.  He just needs something that will carry him.  He tries to explain the freedom in soaring through all of space with nothing constricting you.  Spider-Man tries to imagine what it'd be like but really doesn't have anything to go on.  The Silver Surfer offers to temporarily give him a small bit of the Power Cosmic so he could see what it's like.  Spider-Man says he's tempted but maybe next time.  The Surfer says there won't be a next time.</p><p>Spider-Man asks him if he would allow someone else to experience it instead.  He says it would depend on who the person is.  Spider-Man returns with Mary Jane.  The Silver Surfer introduces himself as Norrin Radd.  With this, Spider-Man is ashamed at himself for never having asked what his name was.  Mary Jane is then given a portion of the Power Cosmic and travels through space for about an hour.<br /></p><p>When she returns, she is overjoyed and cannot begin to describe what it was like.  Spider-Man tells her \"Happy Birthday.\"  Mary Jane tells him she loves him.  This causes the Surfer to think about Shalla Bal.  Mary Jane then thanks Norrin.  He says it was his honor but he must leave now.<br /></p><p>Spider-Man says that he may have thought about a solution to what he wanted to do before.  The Surfer agrees and gives everyone a taste of what the Power Cosmic feels like. For five minutes, the entire world knows what it feels like to be free and at peace.  Spider-Man returns as the Surfer staggers to his board.  The Surfer says that he could feel the entire world and for the first time realizes that he too is at peace.  He thanks Spider-Man for that and Spider-Man thanks him and removes his mask.  The Surfer calls him friend and says goodbye.</p><p>As he floats away, Spider-Man is saddened at how little they all knew him.  He thinks that you never really think about these things until it's too late.  He also says that was the last time he ever saw him.</p>",

How will the public react to him - and can he control the beast within? Don't miss out on the first action-packed adventures of THE ASTOUNDING WOLF-MAN!</em></p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p>The man who had previously confronted Gary was revealed to be named Zechariah and he had been training Gary for three weeks now. He explained that he did drink blood but not human blood and he rarely did it. Gary now had almost complete control over his beast form and even aided in a house fire; the media managed to see him and dubbed him the Wolf-Man. Zechariah decided it was time to make it official and he took Gary to the \"tailor\" to get a supersuit. The suit was designed to store lunar energy to help sustain the wolf form if needed. Wolf-Man later helped a group of super teens called The Actioneers fight off the slime monster Spore. The help was appreciated but Gary withdrew quickly to avoid confrontation. The next night while he was sleeping with his wife he accidentally transformed with no control. He ended up killing one of the heroes who'd helped him.</p><p>-A second printing was shipped on August, 29 with an altered cover.-</p>",

And the only clue to their identity? Two spray-painted letters: N.W. Are the New Warriors really back? As the NYPD Costumed Division inches closer and closer to the truth and Stark unveils his master plan for dealing with these juvenile upstarts, the ex-mutant formerly known as Wind Dancer actually makes contact. Up from the grave: Night Thrasher!</p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p>The rebellion of the New Warriors has made it to national news, garnering the attention of superheroes like the Fantastic Four, The Avengers, the Secret Avengers and the head of SHIELD himself, Tony Stark. While it seems that Wolverine finds one of the New Warriors appears familiar, we return to the plight of Wind Dancer, who has been asked to join the rebellious group. She turns the offer down, but not before the enigmatic Night Thrasher gives her a contact device. Wind Dancer can't seem to stop thinking of the New Warriors after her initial meeting and dreams of regaining her mutant abilities, which makes her feel uneasy. As she continues to live her ordinary life, she hears on television that the New Warriors have been given a full pardon by Tony Stark if they would give up their illegal actions and join the Initiative. After getting in trouble with her boss, Wind Dancer finds herself hauling trash in the alley of the diner she works at, only to have the New Warriors contact device fall and get crushed by a garbage truck. Considering the device junk, she tosses it aside to find in its place are webs and a surprising person from her days at the Xavier Institute, Jubilee. Speaking to Jubilee about her dreams, she finds that Jubilee is actually a member of the New Warriors as well. Wind Dancer decides to join the New Warriors, being informed that while her mutant powers may not return, there are other ways to gain super powers. As a show of this, Jubilee punches a wall and breaks it down, revealing a technological gauntlet.</p>",

The League of Assassins tracks Black Canary to Star City in an effort to liberate the child, Sin, they believe to be the DCU's next greatest assassin. Luckily, Black Canary has other plans for Sin's abilities and future.</p><p><strong><em>Plot synopsis - spoilers ahead</em></strong></p><p>The issue opens with the Justice League taking down Kobra. Green Arrow takes a hit from Kobra and Black Canary comes in and easily takes down Kobra. Green Arrow finishes off with an arrow which on impact, explodes and releases a large amount of glue, sticking Kobra to the wall. Green Arrow ponders, and realises that the both of them were working together as a team now.</p><p>In Star City, Green Arrow and Speedy are observing Dinah from a building and Green Arrow says that Dinah's ex-husband, Craig Windrow to come back is bad timing. Sin makes her way to the school, and Green Arrow finds it suspicious that Dinah's ex-husband to have all these connections for Sin to make it into such a school. Up further from another building, Merlyn plans to settle all personal scores with Green Arrow.</p><p>Three days later, Ollie, Dinah and Sin are having dinner and Dinah proposes that they invite Craig over for a house warming party. Ollie argues with Dinah, saying that she's always wanted to keep the men in her past with her, but Dinah argues back, saying that she wants to make peace with Craig. Sin then grabs onto Ollie's shirt, and teaches him a relaxing technique that she learned at school.</p><p>Two days later, Sin is at school when there's a security alert. Ninjas come in and order the principal to bring her key card and follow them. The ninjas make their way to Sin's learning room and ends up killing the teacher in the process. Sin, angry, beats down the ninjas. She runs out of the school, and the police come, but Sin mistakes them as enemies as well.</p><p>Green Arrow comes up in a car and tells Sin to get in and passes her an arrow, which opens up and releases some sleeping gas. The man that gave Sin the arrow turns out to be Merlyn and drives, contemplating the favour Sin will do for him...</p>",

It sinks in rather quickly that he's completely alone when he stumbles upon a burned down village with skeletons tossed in a well below. Even though this is a strange sight to behold, Ollie's first priority is to find water and food. He picks apart a broken generator and makes a rusty, make-shift bow out of the inner workings. Cutting a cloth for his head, he hunts for his food and builds a fire to distill water enough for him to drink.</p><p>After a few months of hunting, Ollie starts to figure out he's rather good with a bow and arrow. The most surprising thing he's found is happiness. For once in his life, he's happy. He's not sure exactly why, but he is.</p><p>Then one day Ollie hears signs of an airplane flying over head, finally a chance to get out. With rubber burning on an arrowhead (make-shift flare), Ollie shoots it into the air for the plane to see. Much to Oliver Queen's surprise, the plane isn't looking to rescue him, it's out to kill him.</p><p>Usually Ollie would run and hide, but this is a new Oliver Queen. He stands his ground and prepares to return fire... until next issue.</p>",

A great story in which the Hulk helps deliver a baby. These back up stories are a nice addition to the classic reprints, and keeping them in continuity is extremely clever!

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the robots with \"more than meets the eye\" collide! Symkaria and Latveria sit on an international powder keg, and Dr. Doom just lit the fuse! What do the Decepticons have to do with the escalating danger -- and can a group of warriors including Captain America, Optimus Prime, Wolverine, Prowl,</p><p>Spider-Man and Ratchet avert Armageddon? Writer Stuart Moore (WOLVERINE) and artist Tyler Kirkham (X-MEN: PHOENIX–WARSONG) assemble and roll out two fan-favorite forces!</p><p>Under the influence of the \"Aggression Wave,\" Captain America orders the Avengers to attack the, just revealed, Autobots. Optimus Prime tells his soldiers not to kill anyone...unless absolutely necessary. Ms. Marvel cuts loose due to the wave and her half-Kree DNA. It looks like the Avengers will have the upper hand because they are not holding back. Wolverine is about to really go at it when Dr. Doom blasts him from behind. Captain America and Optimus Prime are surprised at his appearance. Doom tells them they can thank him now.</p><p>As Cap turns his attention towards Doom, Ratchet places an inhibitor on Cap's back. As it kicks in, Cap begins to come to his senses. Doom tells them that they have been affected by his mind-altering technology that has been stolen from him. Ratchet gives Cap more inhibitors for his teammates. Ms. Marvel is not having any of that and prepares to attack Ratchet. Being the nice guy he is, Doom blasts her too to break the influence.</p><p>Optimus begins to tell them all their tale. They have been fighting the Decepticons for eons. The Decepticons have been traveling to planets and ravaging them for energon fuel. Ms. Marvel comments that she has seen worlds reduced to empty husks while she traveled with the Starjammers. Doom tells his part in all of this. Some months ago, a prototype for mind-controlling was taken from one of his laboratories.</p><p>Cap ponders over using the inhibitors Ratchet made. He calls Iron Man to do a scan on the technology. With the schematics sent to him, Stark confirms that it should be harmless to them. Cap if finally able to convince Carol to wear one. With everyone back to their senses, the fact that Spider-Man has been taken has not been forgotten. They also discover that the planes that have been attacking Symkaria are not Doom's but rather the Decepticons in disguise.</p><p>Inside Megatron's base, Decepticons are being powered up with their new source of energy taken from Spider-Man. Runamuck is first to get juiced up. Ramjet volunteers to go next but Megatron stops him. He says because he hasn't been there with them as long as the others, he doesn't fully trust him enough to get more power. Megatron feels that he may have arrived to try to take his authority away. He is sent to guard the Doom's stolen Psycho-Prism instead. Skywarp is next to get power. Spider-Man tries telling Megatron that if he gets loose, he's going to smash him. Megatron just goes on about Spider-Man's blood having the biggest anomaly that could be used and refined to make the most powerful form of Energon they've ever seen.</p><p>Outside, the Autobots and Avengers try blasting their way in to no avail. Doom looks down upon them. The idea of teaming with a lower level of beings is beneath him. He decides to go to Symkaria to broker a diplomatic solution instead. The Avengers have no choice but to let him go since they have less than twelve hours until the Symkarians attack.</p><p>Just then, the juiced-up Decepticons burst out and attack. Prime is hit, as is Luke Cage and Bumblebee. They seem to be out-gunned by the powered up Decepticons. Their only hope is the arrival of Iron Man, an expert on man and machines.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Within the Time-Stream...</i></p><p>Rip Hunter, who refuses to break the <i>cardinal</i> rule of time-travel, denies Booster the chance to save his old friend Ted Kord. He is convinced however, when Booster threatens to leave the mission altogether. Rip gives Gold his solemn word to help him save Ted, but tells him to prepare for the consequences.</p><p>Just as they finish their negotiation, Rip's time-screens (courtesy of T.O. Morrow) reveal that history is undergoing massive change. The Death Certificate of Hal Jordan is their first clue. Rip informs Skeets and Booster that due to their extensive traveling through the time stream, they \"chronally contaminate\" the things around them, which is why his invitation to the League transformed into Jordan's death certificate. As they watch the time screens, the very title of the \"Greatest Green Lantern of All Time\" shifts from Hal Jordan altogether, and becomes Guy Gardner! Apparently, some one or some thing has caused Sinestro to interact with Gardner <i>years</i> before he should. This sets off a chain reaction that causes Abin Sur's ring to not find Hal Jordan, but Gardner instead. Because of this, Guy becomes one of the greatest Lanterns of all time, but ends up contracting a \"yellow plague\" from the planet Ghera, and dies decades before he should. Sinestro goes renegade without opposition, and forges the Sinestro Corps long before the current time-line. He ends up conquering the whole of the universe, turning everything into a militant state.Booster accepts his mission, and Rip goes \"time-diving\" to find out who has been tampering with things.</p><p><i>August 14th, 1939</i></p><p><i>Egypt, the Tomb of Kha-Ef-Re</i></p><p>Dan Garrett and his partner Luri discover the Blue Scarab, and when a pillar collapses, Dan transforms into the first Blue Beetle for the very first time.</p><p><i>8 Years ago</i></p><p><i>Pasadena, California</i></p><p>Guy Gardner skips Christmas with his mother and father to watch the Rose Bowl between U of Michigan and Washington. Booster watches from afar, observing that Gardner looks distraught, and constantly eyeing payphones. Suddenly, Sinestro enters Earth's atmosphere, and Booster intercepts him before he finds Gardner. Sinestro becomes irritated, and engages Booster, levelling half of the stadium in the process. Booster manages to survive afater Skeets reveals that the Green Lanterns are still susceptible to the yellow impurity. Sinestro explains that somebody in white with a mask warned him that Gardner would surpass him as Green Lantern, and he has come to dedce how it would be possible to usurp him.</p><p><i>Back in the time-stream</i></p><p>Rip Hunter continues diving, passing several wormholes and alternate dimensions and time-lines. Suddenly, his machines start detecting something of-the-charts, and he discovers a huge shperical structure residing within the time-stream.</p><p><i>Elsewhen, back in Pasadena</i></p><p>Sinestro continues his zeal to encounter Guy Gardner, but Booster Gold once again interferes. Just before Sinestro once again beats him to a pulp, Booster shouts that he is, in fact, Sinestro's biggest fan. He lies that in the future, everybody worships the legend of Sinestro, and that he has come from the future to warn Great Sinestro that the Qwardians would decieve him, and try to reveal his own fears. By seeking out Guy, he would show his fear of being replaced, and Booster has come to tell him \"what he already knows in his heart\", and that is that Sinestro can <i>never</i> be replaced. Sinestro, content with himself, notices Booster's yellow flight-ring. Booster explains that they all wear rings as tribute to him in the future, and that they're all members of the \"Sinestro Corps\", incidentally inspiring Sinestro to forge the faction in the future.</p><p>Sinestro departs Earth, and Booster seeks out Guy. Borrowing some clothes, Michael finds him drinking in a local bar. Booster manages to get Guy to talk about his problems, which stem from his relationship with his father. Apparenly Gardner's father is dying, and wants to reconcile with his son. Booster reveals something about his own father, which he notes that he's never even told Ted. Gold's own father was a crook and a gambler, and he died without the chance to see him again. This inspires Guy to go see his father one last time, and gives Booster his Rose Bowl tickets. Apparetly this sets in motion the events that cause Hal Jordan to recieve Abin Sur's ring, putting Gardner in the second spot he so openly loathes.</p><p>Booster returns to Rip's time-sphere, when suddenly his invitation once again transforms, but this time into the Death Certificate of Superman! Booster finds that Rip is gone, but when he looks outside of the sphere, he finds Hunter idly floating and injured, and Supernova chasing him! Skeets deduces that the being inside the suit is not Daniel Carter, but before they can investigate any further, \"Supernova\" enters a wormhole and disappears into the wild west. He shifts into some cowboy appropriate attire, and enters a bar, proclaiming that he needs a \"gun-fer-hire\". Across the bar, none other than Jonah Hex accepts the bounty.</p>",

The Local super heroes attending and saving victims where they can.</p><p>At the Pentagon Hillstone starts a communication with Bomb over the attacks on other cities stating that they are going to cover up their involvement in their attack on New Port and the bomb teen incident by blaming middle east terrorism and then nuking New Port. Bomb counters with saying that if they want to try she'll send out more of her subject to cause even more terror attacks. And more than this... she wants New Port to become an autonomous state in the union. Making New Port the 51st state.</p><p>At the Smithsonian the agents are looking for connections between New Port and sources of evil and corruption when they are interrupted by Carrie Andrews, or Nyx, a witch whose coven has identified the demon Desarak as the source of the cities evil and killing Bomb would never be enough as Desarak would just choose another. The agents are skeptical but agree to look into it while Nyx finds a sister who will be able to get them close enough to Desarak to do something about him.</p><p>In Illinois Editor Girl (with the power to edit peoples speech bubbles to effect their actions) spots 2 of Bomb's minions in a playground laying land mines. She defeats them easily by editing their speech. Over a pizza Nyx brings Editor Girl up to speed. She needs to edit the text on sacred runes that will allow magic users to enter New Port city to fight Desarak, runes that have previously been used to defeat the demon.</p><p>In New Port Bomb and Red Cross battle, which is far more one-sided now Bomb has her healing and strength power. She brings Red Cross down with some ease.</p><p>Elsewhere.. Desarak is seen plotting his return and states that he molded the Bomb Queen through his disguise as Ashe!</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview:</i></p><p>As the war between brothers continues, a vast new power just entered Shi'Ar space... but what have they come for? For Havok and Vulcan, the answer to that question changes everything and the fate of the Shi'Ar Empire rests on one man's shoulders.</p><p><b>Issue Summary:</b></p><p><i>1000 years ago, the Shi’ar Scout Ship “Blinding Vision”…</i></p><p>Two Scout ships fly through space. In the main ship, a soldier informs his captain that they’ve found something. Their sensors are picking up a massive energy reading, but they haven’t been able to make visual confirmation. And… there are no stars to be found.</p><p>The captain quotes: <i>“The Gods in marriage expelled their children from the Aerie, and hid it…”</i> Sharra and K’ythri be praised, the captain fears. He orders the soldier to report back to Emperor Vyr’tal: the Shi’ar Empire has reclaimed its birthright. The captain looks outside and sees a huge spark coming from a red planet.</p><p>The alarm goes off in the ship. The soldier warns they’re picking up life in orbit around the planet. The captain informs his Helmsman that those people are in sacred Shi’ar space. He’s certain they will leave… or they will die.</p><p><i>Feather’s Edge. Now…</i></p><p>The Shi’ar ships are all under attack by the armada of the Scy’ar Tal. The Starjammers are no exception. At the helm of the ship, Ch’od is warned by Havok to watch his side, but Ch’od mocks back that he’d try evasive maneuvers with his eyes closed this time, for variety. Ignoring this, Havok proclaims they need to get to the Scy’ar Tal command ship, the one that fired at Vulcan. They have to try to communicate with them. Raza wants to offer the Scy’ar Tal their thanks. Korvus replies that they shall see.</p><p>Alex orders Korvus to contact Lilandra and Ka’ardum, and tell them to withdraw the resistance fleet now. He then asks Rachel to reach the Scy’ar Tal telepathically. She tries to do so and a blue telepathic wave surrounds her body. Alex wants to see if she can figure out what the Scy’ar Tal want. Ch’od reminds Alex what the name of the Scy’ar Tal means, but Alex shouts at him to just drive.</p><p>Nearby, charged up magnetically, Lorna panics, her eyes growing wide. She announces to Alex that she can still feel Vulcan’s energy. He’s still alive!</p><p>Outside, Gladiator and Vulcan soar at full rage towards the Scy’ar Tal “Shard” command ship. The Scy’ar Tal, on their side, continue to fire blasts on the remaining Shi’ar ships. Vulcan and Gabriel fly through the walls of the command ship and instantly kill some of the crew. Gabriel demands to be brought to the Scy’ar Tal leader, because… he is going to kill him.</p><p>As the Scy’ar Tal leader, a giant bug-like creature, enters the room, his soldiers bow for their master. The leader calls Vulcan a Shi’ar pretender, and not a Shi’ar. But, he does want to grant Gabriel a gift: if he runs away now, he’ll live. Vulcan can’t believe his ears. They destroy his command ship, kill his men, and expect him to walk away?! He defends that he is no pretender: he is Vulcan, Emperor of the Shi’ar Empire. The leader wants to know if that means Gabriel stands with the Shi’ar.</p><p>To answer the question, Vulcan fires a blast from his hand at the leader, but quickly proclaims what he sees afterward as impossible… the leader still lives! Vulcan continues firing, but the Scy’ar Tal remains alive. Gabriel shouts at Gladiator to do something, and kill his enemy already. Gladiator does as commanded, and flies into action.</p><p>Gladiator tries to punch the leader in his face, but the Scy’ar blocks it with one hand, and then he snaps Gladiator’s wrist. As Gladiator screams in pain, the leader notices aloud that Gladiator is also not a Shi’ar. He throws Gladiator out of his way, and sighs at the waste. Gladiator falls through a wall and is thrown outside in space.</p><p>The leader picks Vulcan up by his throat, and swears that he will die now. And claims that it will be for nothing. His allegiance to the Shi’ar has sealed his fate. Now, the Scy’ar Tal will take back what is theirs. And they will have vengeance. Vulcan screams that the leader will die, and shoots blasts from his eyes. A few moments later, as the smoke clears, Vulcan is… gone?</p><p>As two soldiers help their Eldest up to his feet, they inform him that the coward ran away. But, the Elder corrects, calling the man his brother, their foe is not a coward, and not weak. This one is dangerous. But, that doesn’t matter to him. All that matters is the end of the Shi’ar. The end of all things.</p><p>A telepathic voice interrupts the Eldest and hopes it doesn’t come to that. When the Eldest asks who just said that, the soldier is confused, having not heard anything. The Eldest looks behind himself, to find they are no longer alone. He thinks he can see two people in his mind now, but actually, he can see an astral projection sent out by Marvel Girl. With her stands Havok. They apologize for the intrusion. The two introduce themselves, and that they’re with the Starjammers. Alex and Rachel want to talk for a moment, and add that they represent the resistance to the Shi’ar Empire.</p><p>The Eldest becomes angry seeing more not-Shi’ar. He realizes that Alex and Rachel are like the pretend Emperor and wonders if they will choose death as well. Havok tells the Eldest that, whatever problem he has with the Shi’ar, he’s certain they can come to a peaceful solution. He sees no need for this, because the true Shi’ar leader is Lilandra Neramani. She’s ready to take back control of the Empire from the man they just faced… Vulcan… Alex’ brother.</p><p>The Eldest thinks Alex is lying, as it makes no sense what he says. He would see his own brother fail? He would fight against his own blood? Havok points out that his relationship with his brother is… complicated. The Eldest agrees that nothing is more complicated that brotherhood. For, he announces, if one cannot stand with his brothers, then he will die alone. The Eldest is also aware that Rachel is in his mind, using her power. He wants her to see the truth. The Eldest moves his finger through the astral projection, towards Rachel’s eye. She screams.</p><p>Rachel is startled when a new world opens before her very eyes, and is speechless. She sees how the Shi’ar attacked the red planet of the Scy’ar Tal and slaughtering its people. She also sees how the Shi’ar blew up the planet.</p><p>Havok and Rachel awake in their chairs at the Starjammer, with Rachel still reeling in pain from the experience. Ch’od says it’s good they’re awake again. Vulcan is counterattacking, and he thinks they’re most likely going to die now.</p><p>Outside, Vulcan’s ships fire upon other ships, belonging to the allies of the Starjammers. Rachel informs everyone that the Shi’ar did this. Korvus tries to calm her down and wants her to rest. She explains she saw everything in the Eldest’s mind. The Scy’ar Tal don’t have names, and simply call their leader the Eldest. The Shi’ar nearly wiped out their entire civilization and drove them away from their home. Now, they want to take it back.</p><p>Raza doesn’t think this is much news, as it is what the Shi’ar do. Lorna suggests that maybe they can help, and talk to Lilandra. Alex agrees with her, thinking this is not a problem. If the Scy’ar Tal help them kill Vulcan, Lilandra will give them their land back. It’s a win-win. Rachel corrects Alex he doesn’t understand. Scy’ar Tal isn’t their original name. They’ve spent the last thousand years changing their culture, changing themselves to fight the Shi’ar. Their race’s real name is <i>M’Kraan</i>! The planet they want, the thing they worshipped… they’ve come back to take back the M’Kraan Crystal. Havok considers this in silence.</p><p>Suddenly, an alarm goes off, and Raza warns the Scy’ar Tal has fired a… He stops talking, as something weird just happened. What was just fired has the look of a missile, but his scanners aren’t registering a weapon. The thing is headed towards a planet below them. The thing is transmitting a signal… Raza realizes the Scy’ar Tal have just fired a homing beacon.</p><p>Rachel thinks about something else she heard in the Eldest’ name: <i>“Will finally take you too.”</i> She freaks out, and orders Raza to shoot the thing down.</p><p>Standing in a new ship, Vulcan’s pilot has also discovered that a homing beacon has just been fired. Vulcan doesn’t much care, as he wants these aliens dead and the resistance destroyed. Gladiator, holding his broken arm, sees how a blue glow surrounds all the Scy’ar Tal ships… they’re warping away. They’re running. Vulcan thinks about why the Scy’ar Tal would first send out a homing beacon to a planet and they run away. He suddenly realizes something, and freaks out. He shouts to get out of here, now!</p><p>Aboard the Starjammer, Lorna tries to use her powers to magnetically destroy the object, but it doesn’t work. It must not be made of magnetic material. She asks Rachel what’s going on. As the object grows closer to the planet, Rachel announces that thinks she can stop the thing if she goes outside. Korvus tries to stop her, thinking she has gone mad. Rachel shouts at him to let go. She can feel the people on the planet down there, and how they fear of dying.</p><p>Suddenly, the projectile fires various blasts on the planet. Ch’od thinks he’s having a bad feeling now, just like humans tend to get. Havok shouts at Ch’od to initiate a warp jump right now.</p><p>A yellow energy ray appears, and shapes in the form of a gate, through which blinding energy flows. It is followed by an immense explosion, during which the planet explodes!</p><p>The soldiers in Vulcan’s ship are dumbstruck. When Vulcan demands to know what just happened, the captain explains they just saw Shi’ar technology in action, but on a level that simply isn’t possible. A star emerged from the gate… the Scy’ar Tal have dropped a star on Feather’s Edge. Araki wonders who could have conceived such a weapon. While one of the soldiers puts some bandages around his arm, Gladiator wonders what the trajectory of the Scy’ar Tal ships was before they left. He wonders where they were going. Araki answers they are going to <i>the world</i>. The Scy’ar Tal are heading towards the M’Kraan Crystal. Vulcan reels at the news.</p><p>Inside the Starjammers ship, Ch’od explains that Feather’s Edge had a civilian population of 2.4 billion. They’re all dead now. Havok has opened a communications screen on which Lilandra and Ka’ardum are shown. Alex asks Lilandra if the Shi’ar really did what the Scy’ar Tal said, and if the Crystal is their home.</p><p>Lilandra strongly denies it. She reveals that the Crystal planet is the birthplace of the Shi’ar. It’s where Sharra and K’ythri released the Shi’ar into the universe, and then hid the Aerie into darkness. D’Ken found it, and used the scriptures and rumors of a lost Shi’ar scouting expedition. Lilandra claims that the planet is the Shi’ars rightful home, and that the Crystal was given to them by the gods.</p><p>In that case, Rachel wants to know, why do the Shi’ar fear the Crystal? She thinks Lilandra took it from the Scy’ar Tal. Raza proclaims that’s a lie. Havok takes a seat, while Raza continues his explanations. He says the Crystal is the end of all that is. That it is a nexus of all realities, but that it can destroy theirs in a blink of an eye. Even after what they just witnessed, he thinks perhaps the Scy’ar Tal are the lesser of two evils. He wonders if it could be any worse than the Crystal being in Vulcan’s hands.</p><p>Suddenly, a bright light appears. Vulcan has teleported aboard the ship, along with Deathbird… and the entire Imperial Guard! “Hello, Alex,” Vulcan grins. “Time out.”</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Black Canary and Speedy head to Amazon Island, where a job offer from Athena seems to be the perfect opportunity for Dinah to focus some of her frustrations over what's happened to Green Arrow.</em></p><p>In Themyscira, Athena talks about the beauty of Paradise Island. It is ruled by aggression and warriors, but also majesty and by honour. It’s a land bathed in its own glorified beauty, but then there are days like this: where Oliver Queen, also known as Green Arrow runs from prison. The Amazons chasing him argue amongst each other. “I thought you drugged him!” once says, and the other replying, “I did!! There’s enough in him to sedate a small army!” While arguing amongst each other, Oliver pulls himself up on a tree, does a flip around the branch and kicks the Amazons in the back. He runs off towards the cliffs of the island and makes a jump for it. One of the Amazons then grabs him with a rope and he hangs off the cliff while they drag him back up.</p><p>Elsewhere on the island, Black Canary and Speedy arrive at the island with a boat, and one Amazon, Alcinoe comments on Speedy being “unclean” making a reference to her contracting HIV. Speedy then fights back with a rant on their island and lack of men. Alcinoe then replies with, “Unclean of mind and body.” Suddenly, Black Canary punches Alcinoe and the Amazons behind them ready their swords. Athena stops them and Alcinoe gets back up, having a go at Black Canary with her sword. Black Canary fights back and states that she is here by royal invitation and that is awards her with the rank of emissary and privileges of that title. If a member of her family is slighted in a public forum, she’s within her right to enact admonition by combat. Athena comments on her knowledge of the Amazons’ ways and Black Canary replies that lunch with Diana teaches her a lot of things. Black Canary then asks why they invited her onto the island and Athena replies that they are in need of some new warriors. Athena continues to explain that the titles of new warriors are “Furies”.</p><p> </p><p>In a prison box made of brick is Oliver guarded by four Amazons. One complains of why the other Amazons are late, and the other replies that they are on the other side of the island, and that they are coming here by foot. The Amazon that stated other Amazons were late gets hit by a poisoned dart, and the three other get hit. But one misses and then a fury of the poisoned darts fly through and eventually hit her. Out of the bushes comes Connor Hawke and Oliver tells him to get him out of here.</p><p> </p><p>Back on the island with Black Canary, Athena explains how they want outsiders explaining that teaching them the ways of Amazon combat would help them on the terrain of modern combat. Athena encourages her to join saying that very few outsiders possess the skills they want. Athena then pushes it some more, saying that they <b><i>know</i></b> that she could live among them and that the death of Oliver could give her a new change of scene. Black Canary says she needs to think about it, and Athena gives her one hour. Black Canary and Speedy wonder how Oliver and Connor are going, and Speedy thinks that it will take a lot of more than one hour to get off the island.</p><p> </p><p>The other side of the island, Oliver asks if everyone thought he was dead, and Connor replies a “Yes”. Connor also says that it was worse this time and Oliver sits down in despair. Oliver asks if Black Canary is okay, and Connor replies that she’ll be better once she sees you again. They make their escape through the jungle, and Oliver asks where everyone else is. Connor is confused by this and asks what he means by this, and Oliver asks about the JLA or the JSA. Connor replies that it would’ve been better using stealth, and also took into consideration of relationship of Wonder Woman and Hippolyta, her mother. Oliver comments on the Amazons’ ability to make the Israeli army look like Civil War re-enactors. Connor replies that he’s just assuming that they will get captured, and reminds him that the plan requires them to get out before they notice anything. They walk out into the open and then several spears fall around them, encaging them. Now the both of them are caught, and Oliver comments on them going to need more clothes at some point.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>Joss Whedon &amp; Brian Lynch (plot); Brian Lynch (w), Franco Urru (a); Tony Harris, Urru (c)</p><p>Joss Whedon, Brian Lynch and Franco Urru continue to tell the tale of Angel after the climactic battle that ended the Angel television series. Between the array of new enemies and fallen former friends—not to mention the state of Los Angeles itself—can Angel possibly find a reason to go on? And can some familiar faces help provide that reason? Eisner-winning artist Tony Harris once again supplies a special cover, as does series artist Urru.</p><p>Angel is in his garage and carrying several different weapons when Wesley walks through a door to see him. The liaison says that Angel usually takes the dragon out on rounds but Angel says that he's not going on rounds. He's headed to Santa Monica. He also tells Wesley that he just returned from killing Burge's son, something that surprises Wesley and causes Angel to wonder why the senior partners of Wolfram and Hart didn't tell him that. Angel is a little harsh with Wesley when he tells him he doesn't want the ghost to come along and then drives out of the garage and into the world. As Angel is plowing through demons that happen to be in the way, he reveals the reason for his journey. He knows that Burge knows that he can't kill Angel because he's protected by Wolfram and Hart and he can't kill Wesley because he's a ghost. The only person that leaves him to go after is Connor, so that's where Angel is headed.</p><p>The welcome he gets when he arrives at the hideout isn't what he expects. Nina, Angel's lycanthropic ex-girlfriend, greets him with an angry yell and asks what he wants with Connor. Angel tells her that Connor needs to watch his back and after some more back and forth Nina tells Angel that Connor is in Westwood because I Lord was killed the night before.</p><p>Sometime later in Westwood, dozens of demons of all shapes and sizes are battling for the right to be called Lord of Westwood. Every time that someone seems to be the victor, they get killed and someone new has started calling itself the Lord of Westwood. Angel pulls up in his car and doesn't waste any time jumping into the fray. As he starts killing demons left and right, he notices that he doesn't see Connor and part of him is relieved. Just then Connor appears carrying a large sword and a spear with a demon stuck on one end. They start fighting side by side each trying to impress the other and Angel explains the situation with Burge. Connor seems ok with having a huge target drawn on him and quickly accepts Angel's apology. Connor asks where Angel's been and Angel tells him that he couldn't move for a few weeks. They've been in hell for months so that doesn't cover all the time and Connor asks about that but Angel can't or won't give him an answer. As the demons close in Gwen appears and starts electrocuting demons to death. When the coast seems clear she stops and tells Angel and Connor that she's been to where Kr'ph, the former Lord of Westwood was killed and she needs to show them because the scene points to there being a new player in town.</p><p>At his base, Gunn stands over Betta George and asks him if he's comfortable. The fish is on a bed and held in place by something that looks like webbing and is meant to keep his telepathy from being as effective as it should be. Gunn tells George that he's one of the good guys and that George should trust him. George makes a few sarcastic comments about trusting a vampire and that sets Gunn off and prompts him to tell a little of his recent history. He explains to George that he used to spend most of his time killing vampires and then he messed up and trusted one. He followed the vampire into a battle that where he was dragged off and turned while the vampire went and started talking to a dragon. He blames Angel for his condition but says that even as a vampire and even without a soul, he can do good, and that's what he's trying to do. George says something sarcastic again and Gunn starts pummeling the fish. When George is unconscious Gunn walks out of the room and into another where he takes the orb he'd killed Kr'ph for from his pocket and tosses it onto a pile of treasure near some small demons.</p><p>At Kr’ph’s arena Gwen, Connor and Angel look through the carnage left after Gunn’s attack. Connor asks Angel how Kr’ph was even able to become the Lord of Westwood and Angel tells him that it was because he had the Eye of Ramras, an orb that amplifies power. Angel says that he knew Kr’ph had it but someone else got to it before he could. Gwen goes off and comes back with evidence (the drained bodies of women) that vampires were responsible. Angel looks around and sees markings on the wall made with blood. Connor asks if he knows he did it and though Angel says no, he thinks he does. Angel tells Connor to go back to the offices of Wolfram and Hart and get his dragon. He tells his son to call the monster by his name and when he whispers it in the boys ear Connor says that he’s getting weirder and weirder. When Connor leaves Angel gets in his car and heads for who he thinks drew the symbols.</p><p>At Angel’s intended destination, dozens of women gather around a voice that seems to be retelling the events that landed everyone in hell. The story the voice is telling portrays the speaker as a rather valiant hero. While the speaker goes on and on one of the girls goes over to a blood fountain and fills a goblet with the liquid. As the story ends she brings the goblet over to the speaker, Spike, and the rest of the women chant “bloody hail” in his honor. Moments later the chant is interrupted by a new voice. Spike looks around angrily to see who’s making it and finds that Angel has arrived. Spider, one of Spike’s worshippers, looks lustily at Angel but Spike gets her in line and tells her to throw his goblet in anger for him. Spike informs Angel that he didn’t get where he is now just to have Angel come along and mess it up and he isn’t going to be fighting Angel’s fights anymore. Spike starts to talk about the people that died in their last battle and Angel decks him. Spike stays on the ground (blaming it on him being drunk) and Angel tells him that he’s here because it was a vampire that killed the Lord of Westwood and whoever it was left writings in primordial Sandskrit and that led him to where he is now. Right as he asks “So where is she?” a hand reaches behind him and Illyria grabs him by his jacket and threatens to dismember him.</p>",

One is instantly killed by the other stripped to the bone and then the other blue beetle follows.</p><p>The green lanterns are then teleported to the arena witht wo incarnations of hal jordan and one batman as green lantern.

Segar's original Popeye (a.k.a. <b>Thimble Theatre</b>) comic strips begins with a foreword by <b>Beetle Bailey</b> creator Mort Walker and continues with an introduction by noted film and cartooning critic Donald Phelps. This second volume features work from 1930 to 1932, and most notably includes the debut of Segar's second greatest character: J. Wellington Wimpy. Wimpy stands as a one-of-a-kind icon some 70 years after his creation, the most likeable lowdown cad ever to grace the comics page. <b>Popeye Vol. 2</b> includes the stories: \"Clint Gore\" (continued from the cliffhanger last volume); \"A One-Way Bank,\" in which Popeye opens a bank that allows withdrawals but no deposits; a long war story featuring King Blozo that begins with \"The Great Rough-House War\"; and \"Skullyville,\" which wraps up the daily strips for this volume.</i></p>",

They do not know each other. They can not meet. Trias, the third Janitor, just disappeared. Vince will resume HIs vacant place... hIs primary mission is to support and monitor two prelates at a side meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which brings together the most influential players in global stock markets. The new tomb full dinner: an Iranian facility using atomic energy was bombed. The response was immediate. The USA and Britain are targeted. Almost third world war is triggered. BBC, CNN, TF1, the TSR, .. all channels re-transmit the guests of chaos images. Vince observes the general panic. There is something that disturbs beyond the terrible images that scroll ... but what? </em></p>",
