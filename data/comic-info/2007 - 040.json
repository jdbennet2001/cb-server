It is finally agreed that they need a plan before entering.</p><p>In Milan in the past, Diablo works on his plan to lure the Fantastic Four to his time.  Their family members were the bait but he says that Reed's sister will also be an indgredient.  Diablo's keepers discover that he is trying to summon \"demons\" comprised of the four elements.

Reed sends out remote scanners to get a look around.  Seeing a bright blast of magic coming from Diablo's tower, they now know which way to go.  The duke guard is there in the plaza to meet them.  The guards are no match.  The keepers use sorcery to create dopplegangers of the Fantastic Four that emerge out of puddles to fight them.  Johnny burns off the puddles and they continue on their way.  The Thing is the first to enter Diablo's tower.  Diablo \"looks\" at him with his alchemy powers and causes him to fall back.  As he hits the ground, he shatters into pieces.  Diablo is now ready to use the forces he's unleashed to become immortal.  In order to complete the process, he must choose which \"world\" will be consumed by the energies.</p>",

            "description": "<p>With their ship destroyed, nothing protects the Guardians of the Globe from the harsh environment of space but Atom Eve's energy barrier. She tries to hold on to it but every second it's up saps her strength. Invincible tells the other fliers to push them closer to the Martian ship so they can get inside and they manage to make it just as Atom Eve's field drops. Once inside the team is met by angry Martians. Seeing Shapesmith, the cause for the release of the Sequids and the imprisonment of the Martians, they almost attack. The Immortal convinces them that teaming up against the enemy would be better than taking out their fury on Shapesmith. After Bulletproof kills a wandering Sequid the rest of them find the heroes and attack. The heroes fight back but they are vastly outnumbered. </p><p>On Earth the Lizard League tries to take over a nuclear base. They succeed and get inside, but Shrinking Ray gets in too. Shrinking Ray opens the door from the inside and lets Rex-Splode and Dupli-Kate in to face the League.</p><p>Back in space even more Sequids are attacking. Things look hopeless until Robot sets off a device that drives all the aliens back and knocks them out for long enough for Atom Eve to put up a protective dome.</p><p>In a mall on Earth, Amber Bennet, Invincible's girlfriend, gets closer to another guy.</p><p>In the nuclear base, the Lizard League lays waste to the heroes. Shrinking Ray gets eaten by Komodo, who also kills every copy of Dupli-kate, meaning her death as well. Rex kills the other members of the Lizard League, leaving just him and Komodo left to fight each other. Rex charges up another ball but before he can throw it Komodo bites his hand off. As Rex falls and screams in pain, the ball (in the hand Komodo bit off) explodes, killing the villain. As Rex gets up the cowardly leader of the Lizard League sneaks up behind him and puts a gun to his head.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Sequids begin to overpower Atom Eve's forcefield. Inside of it Robot tries to use his armor to create a larger version of the device he used earlier. Being outside the armor leaves him exposed to the Sequids, so when the dome eventually breaks and the aliens come rushing in, things look dire.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Picking up from the furious action in X-Men, an alien soul vampire called the Hecatomb is rampaging across Cable's South Pacific haven of Providence. The only way to stop this creature is for Cable to restore his telepathy and telekinesis -- but the only way to do that might be to make a deal with the Devil itself -- an alien parasite called the Mummadrai. To save his dream, will Cable sacrifice his soul?</p> <p>In his mind Cable runs over the dead bodies of fellow X-Men as he heads towards the team fighting the Hetacomb. When he reaches the beast, he asks the Mummudrai in his head what he should do. The telepathic leech tells him he must do what he does best and he asks himself, \"What do I do best?\" He says that what he does best is what 'they' all expect of him. Then he asks what he expects of himself. Cable comes to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter because everyone makes up their mind about who you are. The thing is, the mind plays tricks on you.</p> <p>In the real world, Cable hasn't moved an inch. He's standing motionlessly in a hallway as Domino and Prester John come up to see what's wrong.</p> <p>While Prester and Domino try to see what's up with Cable, the X-Men continue to fight the Hetacomb. Cannonball explodes in the monster's face in order to damage it, but his attempts do nothing.</p> <p>Back in the hall with Cable, the Mummdrai in his head tells him that Rogue, who is on a hospital bed in the room at the end of the hall, is their only hope. Domino and Prester leave to solve other problems and Cable gets back to the world in his head, but the Mummdrai isn't the only other thing there anymore. The alien is beginning to reactivate his psychic powers and he can hear the minds of all the people the Hetacomb has attacked. Cable knows that the powers are a double-edged sword though, one he keeps cutting himself with. He wanted to change the world with ideas, not \"the blunt end of a mutant stick.\" His powers put him in bad position. Using them to save the world today, ruins his plans for the future. His real body takes a step.</p> <p>Elsewhere on Providence, Black Box and Irene try to figure out what's going on. Black Box doesn't know since Cable has cut himself off from the infonet. Irene gets a message from some of the workers on Providence that are trying to evacuate all the inhabitants. He says that it would take a lot of trips to get everyone off Providence, and even then, the boats would be sitting ducks in the water.</p> <p>As Cable continues his slow progress to Rogue, as well as trying to decide if he should save the world now or shape it later, he hears a familiar voice in his head. Deadpool. He figures that the Merc with a Mouth is with him to help him make a choice, so he talks it out with him. He says that if he does what he has to do, he can save Providence and maybe the whole world, but if he does that, Rogue might die and he might become a slave to his powers again. Deadpool says that since Cable said, \"If I do what I have to do,\" he already knew what choice to make. Deadpool starts to vanish from Cable's mind, and Cable says, \"She's bluffing.\"</p> <p>At Agency X headquarters, Wade is playing strip poker with Outlaw, but he's zoning out. Bob, Agent of Hydra, tells Wade to snap out of it since it's his turn, and he calls Outlaw on her cards. Turns out that the \"she\" Cable was talking about was Outlaw. Deadpool wins the hand and Outlaw has to lose her top.</p> <p>In Cable's mind again and his powers are getting stronger. He's feeling people all across the world. He feels Deadpool's happiness when he gets a look at Outlaw's goods. He feels Bullseye's happiness as he kills someone. Cable says he was happier when he was only <em>pretending</em> to know everything, but now he actually does. As his mental body runs around Providence, he tells the guys running the evacuation to tell everyone to hang on as he separates the bottom of the floating island and saves 80% of the population. In the hallway (but also still in his mind), Cable is drawn between Deadpool and Domino. Representations of what he needs to do, and what he wants to do, respectively. Cable chooses Deadpool and heads towards Rogue. Energy starts to gather around Cable, so much energy that everyone all over Providence can feel it, and he runs towards Rogue. It's time to do what he has to do. What he always knew he'd do. Even if he doesn't like it.</p>",
