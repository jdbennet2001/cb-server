            "description": "<p><em>With a recent tragedy hanging over their heads, Green Arrow and Black Canary realize that they may not have actually gotten married. But will they try again or drift apart in the wake of all that's happened to them? Featuring art by Amanda Conner (GREEN ARROW/BLACK CANARY WEDDING SPECIAL)!</em></p><p>Black Canary and Red Arrow are going over and over the footage to try to find out who shot Connor. Roy asks why Batman isn't looking into it if he's the one that crated the program they're using to look at the spectrum analysis. She says he's looking into other things. Doctor Mid-Nite comes in and tells Dinah he's finished looking over Connor. He says he's in perfect physical health but his mind is a complete blank. Mid-Nite asks how Ollie's doing. Dinah says he hasn't left Connor's side. Also that today is Connor's birthday.</p><p>Ollie sits by Connor's side. He's been reading to him but says that he promised Dinah he'd talk to him about when he met Connor's mother. Ollie was a big time womanizing jerk. Hanging out with three women outside a club, a woman walks up to him and tells hims she's Sandra Hawke. Ollie likes what he sees but says he's already busy but she's welcome to join them, if she's into that. Sandra tells him that they already slept together. Ollie says he wishes he could remember that and Sandra cuts him off. She says she's pregnant. After a moment of shock, Ollie says \"Paternit Test.\" He says she should get rid of it but if she does have it, he wants a paternity test. As he storms off, she says she doesn't want money or anything but he doesn't understand why she would be coming to him then.</p><p>Eight months later, Sandra has given birth. Ollie visits her in the hospital and sees Connor for the first time. When she comments he looks different, he says he is. He had some \"boat trouble\" and is a new man. He tells her he's going to set up a bank account and she can take as much from it as she wants. She insists again that it was never about money. Ollie tells her to take it and that he can't be a father. He's doing more important things. He also tells her not to tell Connor about him and leaves.</p><p>Years later, Ollie asks Batman to help him find his son. He figures since Batman has a \"son,\" he'd help. Batman says he doesn't have a son. Ollie tells him that he's raising him and basically is his father but Batman says he's more than a son. He fights by his side. Ollie wouldn't understand that.</p><p>Young Connor has been getting expelled from school after school. When Sandra is called in to his final school before being sent off to juvenile detention, she says he has a problem with his temper and he was bullied. The principal says it's more than that since he seriously injured three boys. Sandra decides to tell Connor about his father. Connor thinks it's cool. She takes him to the monastery that Ollie went to in the hopes that he will be able to control his anger and impulses. Batman later gives this information to Ollie.</p><p> </p><p>Ollie feels bad about how he kept pushing Connor away. He says he is going to make things right now. Dinah walks in and tells him that he has been making it right. Ollie tells her he wants to take care of Connor. He's going to give up being Green Arrow to do it. He says it's because of that that Connor was injured. He wants to be his father. Dinah smiles and tells him to marry her. Ollie says they are but she reminds him that it wasn't him at the ceremony. Ollie agrees but insists on a small ceremony this time.</p><p> </p><p>Wonder Woman performs the ceremony while Superman watches from above and Batman from behind. After they are married, Dinah suggest they go on a honeymoon since he was \"dead\" after the last time they tried getting married. Ollie says he wants to stay close by for now. She understands.</p><p>To their shock, they find one of Connor's nurses, dead at the bottom of the stairs. Ollie runs up, busts through the door and finds the room empty except for the other nurse, also dead. With a look of extreme anger, he tells Dinah to get his \"damn bow.\"</p>",

First, in issue 4, Sabretooth, Psylocke, Rogue, and new ally Gambit are caught in the middle of a war between the Atlanteans, Queen Ororo, and the Black Panther. Plus, whatever happened to Mystiq? Find out in the conclusion to the series’ first arc! Then, in issue 5, a new tale begins as we see the trouble Morph, Sage, and Cat run across in a world of royalty and dragons!</p><p>Reality-hopping action as only the New Exiles can deliver!</p><p>In the Crystal Palace as the others are away, Sage spends her days fighting contstructs non-stop. Morph and Cat watch as she fights for hours. Cat makes it pretty clear to Morph that she doesn't really care for Sage. When he calls her on it, she says she hardly knows Sage so why would she not like her?</p><p>Shortly in the Observation Room, Cat is working the computers with ease. Morph is amazed at how quickly she's taken to them. Cat says she just has a knack for machines. Suddenly there's a spark and the room is indundated by numerous images of Cat, apparently from different realities. She is getting sucked into a vortex (or \"rabbit hole\" as Morph calls it) and he jumps in after.</p><p>In Sage's room, she's taking a nice bubble bath and enjoying a drink when she, somehow hears Cat screaming. She's not sure how she'd be able to hear them but grabs (a tiny) towel and runs to see if they're okay. In the Observation room, she catches the tale end of Morph and Cat being sucked into the vortex and has no choice but to jump in after her teammates.</p><p>In a strange new world, Morph is pleased to see Sage's little towel. Cat is dressed in a gaudy pink dress and can't seem to get out of it. Phasing doesn't even work. Soon they find a man on a dragon fighting several men with swords. A choice is made and the Exiles decide to help the man with the dragon. The fight goes on and Sage seems to have no problem fighting nekkid. It turns out the man is of royalty and has fallen in love with the dragon during a right of passage where he was supposed to kill the dragon. His mother isn't too happy and is the one that sent the armed men after them. The Queen sends another man named Venger out to kill the dragon.</p><p>Cat goes through some changes again. Sage wonders how she is accessing the other dimensional versions of herself. She wonders if it has something to do with Cat or something to do with this world. As Cat freaks out, Sage tries to calm her. They are both surprised that Sage is using telepathy to \"talk\" to her. Sage thinks to herself that this isn't possible. Charles gave his word she'd be able to control it. They all wonder what is to come next on this world.</p>",

Superman is beginning to get a grasp on handling him when Batman gives him a call. Wonder Woman tells him to go ahead, she'll take over. At Konvikt and Graak's spaceship, Superman finds Batman standing over a bounded Graak. Batman is trying to find out why they're on Earth. Scanning the ship, they uncover a way to stop Konvikt.</p><p>Superman returns with a gas that would place Konvikt in cryosleep. When he sprays him, Konvikt holds his breath. Wonder Woman deals with this by knocking the wind out of him. Konvikt is finally down and out. Batman shows up with another alien tied up, the one that burned a mark on Wonder Woman's shoulder. The alien turns out to actually be one of Morgaine's minions. She is shocked that Batman was able to track him while Enigma simply laughs at this. The minion begins telling them that they are the Trinity but are weakened. Before it can fully inform them of his mistress' plans, he bursts into flames. Konvikt is then transported to the Slab.</p><p>Elsewhere, Tarot is doing a reading again. She turns up the cards the Devil, Strength, and Justice. To her amazement, before her eyes, the cards change to reveal Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman.</p>",

Black Jack says, \"Just as I left it.\" He turns to Tom and gives him one last chance. He tells him it'll be his power for his life. He tells him to find him on the mountain and leaves.</p><p>Tom and Vicki begin to enter to doorway and the grass starts growing and tangling their feet.

But he discovered right away that he couldn’t escape the ol’ Parker luck! After flirting with corruption and disaster on the rollercoaster ride of fame and success as a teen sensation, Peter may think he’s getting it under control…but he’s about to face the greatest challenge of his young life…</em></p><p>Spidey is perched on the wall of a police station where an elderly man is about to commit suicide. In trying to prevent the guy from jumping, Spidey says the wrong thing and he takes the leap. Luckily, Spidey catches him before he hits the ground.</p><p>Later on at Tiffany's Spidey tells her that he doesn't feel he's cut out for the hero business. She says Angel knows of a bank heist that's going down the tomorrow and Spidey questions just where Angel gets his info and wonders why he doesn't call the cops. If he did, Angle would be in danger. Spidey feels like his life is no longer his own.</p><p>The next day, just as Tiffany said, the bank job is going down. Spidey drops down and spooks the robbers, causing the driver to floor it injuring a few of the other crooks in the process. He crashes into a fire hydrant and Spidey feels like a total chump.</p><p>Angle sees the next edition o the Daily Bugle, which slams Spider-Man for endangering lives out in public. Angle thinks he should pay a visit to Jameson but Tiffany suggests otherwise, stating that Spidey isn't ready for this type of life and he's about to snap. Angel gets rough with her and tellers her that it's her job to make sure he is ready.</p><p>When Spidey stops by Tiffany's that night, she's got a black eye in addition to being wasted. Spidey finally decides to come clean and pulls of his mask but Tiffany is so hammered she says she'll be lucky if she can even remember her was here. Tiffany tells Peter that Angel is on his way to shut Jameson up for good. Just as Jameson faints from Angel's thug getting rough with him, Spidey crashes through the window. After saving Jonah's life, Spidey takes a look at the editorial he was typing and makes several alterations.</p><p>The next day, Jameson sees the Bugle headline which praises Spider-Man's crime fighting. Jameson is not pleased. Swinging off, Spidey admits what he did was childish, but he is a kid and he thinks its time he started to act like one. Stopping by Tiffany's he sees all her things are cleared out. He knows he'll never see her again and he's fine with it.</p><p>Peter's on his way home when he sees the two police cars parked in front of his house. Running inside, Peter finds aunt May crying. Peter asks where uncle Ben is. Uncle Ben is... alive? He walks in shortly after Peter. He was looking all over for Peter because he was gone for a whole week. Thankful that uncle Ben is OK, he gives him a big hug. On the TV, the news reports of an armed robber on the loose...</p>",

He explains that Wolverine recieved a call from his old military base in Quebec. Without explanation, he took the Blackbird and set course that by Cerebro's calculations will take him back that same base. Charles further explains that like any of the X-Men, he is free to leave at any time, but he has taken Kitty Pryde with him, and that is not acceptable. He sends Angel, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Storm to intercept him.</span></p><p>While heading for Quebec on the Blackbird, Logan shares a story with Kitty, about his days with Alpha Flight. He starts with how Heather and Jimmy Hudson found him while they were hiking on their honeymoon. He was like an animal, with no memories. Department H took him in, trained him, and gave his life new meaning, defending Canada from menaces such as Hulk and Wendigo.</p><p>One day he was sent on a mission that would change things between him and the government forever. There was a hostage situation at La Citadelle in Quebec, intel said that some of the captors were superhuman. Logan is asked to form a strike team to handle the situation. He chooses Aurora, Shaman and Snowbird. Aurora and Snowbird are sent in first as recon, and Snowbird makes use of her Postcognitive Sight, which allows her to see any event up to six hours old. While Wolverine and Shaman meet with police, Aurora returns saying that there's fourteen of them, and she hasn't seen Snowbird anywhere. The attackers have rounded up the garrison, the staff and all the tourists into the museum, along with a goat. A member of Canadian Intelligence shows up on the scene and informs the team that this is now a matter of national security, and that the Governor General is among the captives, recsuing her has become top priority. Snowbird returns from recon as a mouse, and says that they took her into the cellar inside her residence and that one of them is definitely superhuman. Wolverine splits the team. He will handle extracting the Governor General, while the rest secure the museum. While rescuing the hostages in the museum, the team makes an odd discovery.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wolverine has almost completed his part of the mission when the mystery superhuman sneaks up on him. He didn't detect his scent because it was so much like his own. The man was covered with adamantium. Logan tells Kitty that this was the first time his claws couldn't cut something, and trying sent a painful vibration up his arm. The man who calls himself Citadel, tells Wolverine about how he and his men were wounded overseas. They were told that they were being sent home to a clinic to receive the latest in medical treatment, but instead they had synthetic metal grafted onto their bodies which was slowly killing them. Citadel was codenamed \"Weapon Y\", but instead of being used as a weapon, he broke out taking his men with them. They started this so they could get fair compensation for their pain, or demand a press conference so the public would know what was going on. Wolverine tries to tell him that something similar happened to him, and that he was on his side, but Citadel was too angry to listen. Suddenly he gets distracted by a goat, which turns out to be Snowbird.</p><p>Wolverine again tried to get citadel to listen, but the man from Canadian Intel shows up and zaps him with a neuro-taser. When Wolverine asks him if there was any truth to Citadel's story, he refuses to tell him anything. Except that he was never here and that Wolverine doesn't have the clearance to know otherwise. Logan's friend Jimmy Hudson finds out where Citadel was from, and manages to make intelligence let Shaman operate on him. There is little hope however, since nothing can get through the adamantium. Furthermore, he tells Logan that his healing factor is the only thing keeping him alive, and that his rages and memory loss could be due to adamantium poisoning. When Wolverine learned about Colonel Kinney meeting with Professor Xavier, he resigned from Alpha Flight and joined the X-Men. And now he is at the part why he brought Kitty all the way up here.</p><p>The X-Men arrive to find Kitty safe and sound. She explains that Logan got a call from Shaman saying that Citadel had gotten worse, and that is when he realized that there was one thing that could get through his adamantium skin and save his life. Kitty's phasing power. He raced up there with her as fast as he could, and there was no time to explain. Sadly, they got there too late.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Superstars JEPH LOEB &amp; ED MCGUINNESS continue their historic epic! With the entire West Coast in peril, who can stop the battle of the Century when Two, count 'em TWO Hulks, get to brawling? How about everyone's favorite Thunder God -- THE MIGHTY THOR!? He was out of town during WORLD WAR HULK -- THIS is the match-up you've been DEMANDING! But can even a God stop the Red Hulk? Find out now!!!</p><p>On top of the Golden Gate Bridge, Red Hulk stands facing Thor. Thor wastes no time in striking Rulk full force in the face with Mjolnir. To his surprise, it doesn't even phase him. Thor asks what kind of beast he is and Rulk replies the \"kind that beats the snot out of Thunder Gods.\" He also tells him that he doesn't believe in Gods.</p><p>Thor makes it clear that he was sent to Midgard to protect them and Rulk's appearance threatens them all. Rulk tires to make it clear that since Thor's been gone a lot has happened and he's not the Hulk he's faced before. He tells Thor that he's actually studied him. He respects his battle records but tells him like all great fighters, there's always one battle they can't win.</p><p>Rulk then seems to do the impossible. Grabbing Mjolnir, he jumps up. Thor is surprised by this. He starts wondering if it has something to do with his father not being around. Rulk shuts him up saying he couldn't care less. He says he knows his secrets and how no one but him can lift the hammer. He tells him all he's doing is jumping while Thor's holding onto it. His jump takes them to the point where there is zero gravity. Still shocked, Rulk takes Mjolnir away. He smashes Thor with it. Thor vows to return him to Earth and put an end to him. Three more blows and Thor is out.</p><p>Pleased with his work, Rulk grabs Thor by the cape, twirls the hammer and directs it back to Earth. Smiling over the defeated Thor, he kicks away his helmut and jumps. Thor, begins to come to and says Hulk has earned his \"wrathful vengeance\" since he left him alive.</p><p>Iron Man arrives at the Baxter Building to get Reed's help with the video of General Ross talking to Banner. Reed is fascinated by how the audio level of the video had been doctored. He tweaks it to try to recover the hidden dialogue. Some more of the conversation is revealed but not all of it. Banner said something about Samson but then the lights go out at the Baxter Building. The power is restored immediately but Reed tells Tony that the video had a Trojan horse-like virus attached to it. This wasn't the work of an amateur.</p><p>Commander Hill calls Tony then about detecting the return of the Red Hulk to Earth. His landing has triggered the San Andreas fault and San Francisco is about to fall into the ocean. Instead of calling the military to deal with Rulk, Tony gets a better idea.</p><p>Under the Golden Gate Bridge, A-Bomb swims down to retrieve Hulk (the green one) from the wreckage he's pinned under. Hulk questions why \"Blue Man\" helped him. A-Bomb tells him that there's been an earthquake everywhere and it's Red Hulk's fault. Hulk tells A-Bomb to stay and help the city while he goes after Red Hulk.</p><p>Just then Iron Man calls out to Hulk. He tells him he'll need some help and he's brought some. WIth Iron Man stands She-Hulk, the Thing, Ares, the Human Torch and Namor.</p>",

Can Earth's demoralized, beaten heroes rally their scattered forces for the ultimate super-battle against the nightmare armies of Apokolips when the forces of good meet the forces of evil on the bridge to Blüdhaven? As Darkseid's presence causes reality itself to sicken and the lights to go out across the universe, as even the Guardians fall, the true power of the evil gods finally reveals itself, and a major character returns for a shocking conclusion.</i></p><p><i>Does the secret of humankind's salvation lie in a mysterious cave painting and a bolt of lightning? Or has the Last Day come for us all?</i></p><p>Hal Jordan is in trial on Oa and stands accused of the murder of Orion and attempted murder of John Stewart. \"Alpha Lantern Kraken\" claims that Hal is still under the influence of a fear parasite. Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner then arrive and confirm Hal's innocence and say he was implanted with a suppressor chip so he cannot remember his whereabouts at the time of Orion's murder. Alpha Lantern Kraken is in fact Granny Goodness attacks the Green Lanterns and injuries one of the Guardians. She tries to infect the Green Lantern's Central Battery but is subdued by the Green Lantern Corps. Hal is cleared of all charges and is told that Darkseid's fall has caused damage to Earth crumpling it's timezone and literally cracking outer space Hal, Kyle and Gardner go to Earth with any other volunteering Green Lanterns to stop Darkseid.</p><p>Renee Montoya is at some Checkmate headquarters where she sees the new Omacs and is told by that she is a big part of a plan to save Earth the day superheroes cannot.</p><p>In Bludhaven Mokkari Simyan and Godfrey all beg Darkseid (Who has completely taken over Dan Turpin's body) to save them and give them new bodies. Darkseid says that his hour comes soon and tells his Female Furies (Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Batwoman, Giganta) to get ready for \"the hour of Apokolips\".</p><p>As The Resistance continues to battle the Anti-Life infected heroes and villains in the Checkmate Castle, The Super Young Team are angry at Checkmate for shooting Shilo Norman (a accident by a Checkmate soldier). However, Shilo is unharmed thanks to his impact-proof vest he's wearing.</p><p>In Bludhaven, Kalibak and his Tiger henchmen battle the first attack wave (Which includes Captain Marvel, Black Adam , Frankenstein, John Stewart, Supergirl and more). Mary Marvel heads to battle Supergirl, but is interrupted by Black Adam who tries to kill her saying she is not truly Mary anymore and under someone else's control. Mary defeats Black Adam and then begins to beat Captain Marvel. Tawky Tawny arrives to help Captain Marvel, but is confronted by Kalibak.</p><p>Nix Uotan is put in a room somewhere and is talked to by some sort of Gorilla man in a hood while a man in a wheelchair turns a rubik's cube. The room is for those that are different and cannot be affected by Anti-Life. Nix states his doubt at any hope to survive. The hooded man then uncrumbles one of Nix's papers and sees a drawing of the female Monitor Weeja Dell and reminds Nix that maybe he can use his powers, and tells him that sometimes power is in words like someone who cared only for him. At that moment, Nix remembers Weeja Dell's name only before some of Darkseid's scientists and Justifiers enter the room to punish them for being different, but just then the man in the wheelchair finishes his rubik's cube. Suddenly, there is a flash of light that possibly kills some of the Justifiers.</p><p>Libra brings Calculator to be executed in public for betraying the Secret Society and Darkseid, and for telling the superheroes of the Unternet. Libra tells Luthor that he may be in charge of the forces against the Superheroes in Bludhaven.</p><p>The superheroes attempt to break the force field around Command-D station but Supergirl is attacked by Mary Marvel. Darkseid's followers are all severely injured, saying how Batman has escaped. The Green Lantern Corps arrive on Earth but the effects of Darkseid's fall is causing a singularity so they chose to power down all Green Lantern rings to life support and chose to fall to Earth.</p><p>As the Earth literally darkens, Darkseid takes over half the planet's population and controls billions of human bodies.</p><p>Nix Uaton is now fully powered and back in his true Monitor form as someone calls him the judge of all evil.</p>",

Before Karolina can inform them of the weapons they have on the ship, the Leapfrog is promptly hit with a solid blast.</p><p>The Leapfrog is rocked by the attack, but continues on its wayward path. The Majesdanians close in fast, so Victor pilots the ship quickly downwards. The Runaways are now getting annoyed with Victor's inability to drive the frog; Molly throws up over Klara.</p><p>Chase attempts to get him out of the bubble; this turns out to be pointless, as the bubble is very flexible. He gives up after a short while, realizing that it's never going to break. He reaches into the back part of his cycle and grabs the Fistigons; he uses one to blast the bubble, but the bubble simply warms up. Chase decides to get more juice... a second later, the bubble explodes, but so does Chase's motor cycle. As it turns out, Chase used both his Fistigons and \"Footstigons\" (feet versions of the gauntlets) to break out the bubble.</p><p>As the Leapfrog and the Majesdanian ship left without him, Chase rushes off into the garage to see what's in there. He tries to start an impressive Honda Civic, but nothing happens - he is out of gas. The Volks Wagen bus next to him, however, isn't. A short time later, Chase drives out of the garage in the VW bus wondering where the Runaways left. Before he can answer himself, the Leapfrog crash lands next to him in flames. The Leapfrog takes off again, heading into the sky with a plume of black smoke leaving a sorry trail behind it - this is closely followed by the Majesdanian ship. Chase is concerned for his friends, and gets ready to rock. He turns the key but the bus simply chugs into life, driving after the Leapfrog and the Majesdanian ship.</p><p>In the Leapfrog, Molly informs everyone that one of her fillings has fallen out. Nico is shocked - they don't have health care. Molly, however, apologizes and tells them she was just joking. Nico, frustrated, turns her head away from her.</p><p>Victor suddenly understands - they are no longer under the effect of the scatter spell; Molly had just apologized. Xavin assumes Victor is right; clearly, the Majesdanians are free of the spell. And, everyone <i>did</i> get into the Leapfrog when Nico ordered them to. Nico is stunned to realize they are correct; she asks everyone, after the count of three, to yell cheese. \"One! Two!... three!\" Everyone (including Old Lace) shouts cheese, and Nico clenches her fists in recognition that the team is back together, free of the scatter spell. Their joy is cut short as once again, the Majesdanian ship opens fire on them... in a hunt that takes place all night long.</p><p>(Los Angeles, the next morning)</p><p>Chase rumbles through traffic; having chased the Runaways all night, the VW bus is running out of gas. Frustrated, he punches the console of the bus and a dashboard pops out, revealing several hidden technical buttons. Chase is intrigued; he presses a button labelled \"Steinbus\". In an instant, the VW is transformed into a rocket-powered bus, with four engines popping out of the back. The engines kick into life, and the VW is instantly propelled forwards at high speed. Chase presses the button next to it; wings. Instantly, wings pop out of the back of the bus and the van becomes airborne. \"Jackpottttttttttt!!!!\" cries Chase as the bus surpasses all his expectations.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Leapfrog is still being chased by the far superior Majesdane ship. Nico realizes that they have little hope of losing them and asks for the cloaking device; this doesn't work, as the Majesdanians will still be able to find them through Karolina's energy signature. The only thing they must do is fight; Karolina is unwilling to fight the survivors of her planet. But it is Molly Hayes who has the idea; she raises her hand, but Nico doesn't want any more of her jokes. Molly, annoyed, sits back reminding them she is a member of the team as well. Molly's idea is for Karolina to put on her bracelet; if that was how her powers were kept hidden, it can hide her energy from the Majesdanian police.</p><p>Everyone is stunned with Molly's plan. It makes total sense. But a disappointed Karolina mentions she doesn't have it anymore... Xavin does, and had kept it all this time. Before she can put it onto her wrist, Nico asks them to wait. She has a plan.</p><p>(Long Beach)</p><p>In Long Beach, a tour guide informs a crowd of tourists of the RSM Queen Mary, moored nearby. The Leapfrog flies into one of the Queen Mary's large engines, activates the cloaking device and Karolina puts on her bracelet. They are in utter stealth mode. Sure enough, the Majesdanian ship, unable to find the Leapfrog, slowly flies away. As the Runaways celebrate their accomplishment, Nico, horrified, notices something out the window.</p><p>Chase Stein, in his VW bus is flying towards the Majesdanian ship, guns blazing.</p><p><b>Notes</b>:</p><p>This issue features the RMS Queen Mary, a ship moored in Long Beach, California, after serving for thirty-one years as an ocean liner. Chase sings \"Born to be Wild\" by Steppenwolf. Chase also refers to the bus as \"Woodstock\", the so-called hippie era's famed 1969 festival. VW buses were very popular with the hippie crowd.</p>",

It's an all-time Iron Man classic that's so  great that for good measure, we're also bringing you the carnage of the  Controller, a threat so awesome that it brings Iron Man together with  Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. to stop it!</i></p> <p>Collecting <a data-ref-id=\"4050-2407\" href=\"/iron-man/4050-2407/\"> Iron Man</a> #2 - 13.<br /></p> NOTES: <br />The marbled variant cover edition is #107 in the chronological numbering.<br />REGULAR EDITION ISBN:     978-0-7851-3493-0 <br /> VARIANT EDITION ISBN:     978-0-7851-3494-7",
