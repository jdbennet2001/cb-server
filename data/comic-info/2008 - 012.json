The Justice Society reaches out to the next wave of legacy heroes: the new Mr. America, Judomaster, Amazing Man and more! Plus, another face familiar to the Kingdom Come Superman makes his presence known.</p><p><b>Spoilers!!!</b></p><p>Jakeem Thunder and Thunderbolt arrive at the new Justice Society headquarters in New York. Jakeem is a little put off that there's no one to greet them and there aren't any pictures of him around. Walking into the gym he lets out a \"Who the $%#@ are you?!\" when he sees Tommy, Damage (in his masked costume, Starman, and Citizen Steel in front of a boxing ring. Wildcat is in the ring with another new member, Judomaster. Everyone introduces themselves to him. Jakeem soon asks what's going on. Wildcat says Judomaster is in their custody until her court date. Damage was able to talk the authorities into that after she carelessly caused injuries the day before. He wants to check out her fighting skills and has her wearing boxing gloves. The boxing match begins and Wildcat goes flying on the mat.</p><p>Jay Garrick, Alan Scott and Hawkman are looking over several photographs trying to figure out who else they're going to recruit. Mr. Terrific is meeting with one already with Stargirl and Cyclone.</p><p>In New Orleans, the Superman from the future and Power Girl meet with the new Amazing-Man. Superman doesn't recognize him from his Earth. Power Girl fills him in on the history of those that bore the name before this one. He is willing to discuss getting involved with the JSA but would like them to help him first with some clean-up left over from Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>Former FBI agent, Mr. America discovered that a couple of metahuman criminals that claimed to be Demigods were found dead with holes blown through their chests. He then finds several more \"Demigods\" dead, the New Olympians. Watching from behind stood a man in the shadows with horns on his head.</p><p>In Chicago, Mr. Terrific meets with Black Lightning about his daughter, Thunder. Cyclone immediately attempts to strike up a friendship with her.</p><p>Back at the scene where Mr. America was, Liberty Belle and Hourman talk with FBI agents there. They tell them that Mr. America beat them there by mintues. They hadn't heard from him since. Hourman points out to her that there's a word carved into a stone pillar, the word \"Gog.\"</p><p>In Northern Afghanistan, Jay, Alan and Hawkman meet with Corporal David Reid, also known as Lance about membership. He is able to release plasma energy and developed a pulsing tattoo on his arm. He wonders why they're interested in him. They tell him it's not because he's in the military but because of who his Great-grandfather was, Franklin D. Roosevelt. That was the man who first brought the Justice Society of America together. It's all about the legacy.</p><p>Back at JSA headquarters, Wildcat is getting tired out not being able to lay a glove on Judomaster after eighteen rounds. Before it can continue, Mr. America, badly beaten and barely able to walk, staggers into the Justice Society Of America headquarters and asks if they've ever heard of \"Gog.\"</p>",

Donna asks Ray why have they arrived there. Ray is still upset and says his work is destroyed. Jason tries telling him to get a grip. Kyle figures the Source must want them there for a reason.</p> <p>In Metropolis, Jimmy is taking a shower as Forrager looks for something to eat in his fridge that doesn't smell like \"leechspore fecal matter.\" As Jimmy gets out of the shower, he is surprised to see, written in the fog on the mirror, \"To Apokolips.\"</p> <p>On Paradise Island, Mary Marvel is pretending to be a slave girl. This isn't going so well as she is getting pushed around by some of the new recruits. Harley grabs her by the hair and pretends to be punishing her. It seems that Harley is hoping that Mary has some gossip from the outside world. Mary ignores this and asks here what a fury is.</p> <p>Granny Goodness is upset when she hears about Bernadeth's death. Desaad simply wants her to provide someone to take her place. She tells him she has to take care of the ceremony and Desaad leaves in a Boom Tube.</p> <p>Back on Apokolips, Solomon the Monitor is meeting with Darkseid. Darkseid tells him that they are near the end of their game.</p> <p>Granny Goodness, under the guise of Athena, begins the ceremony to turn all her recruits into Female Furies. Mary can't stand for this anymore and disrupts the ceremony. Granny orders her Furies to kill her so Holly and Harley have no choice but to reveal their loyalties and help out Mary.</p> <p>Before anyone is killed, Hippolyta arrives and takes on Granny (still disguised as Athena). Granny is surprised to see her there. When Hippolyta cuts her face with her sword, Granny's true form is revealed as she is shocked at being hurt. Hippolyta draws everyone's attention to Granny as she runs away in a Boom Tube. Harley, as crazy as always, figures they can't let her escape and jumps into the Boom Tube after her. Surprised, Mary and Holly figure they'd better go after Harley. Hippolyta stands before all the women telling them they need to talk.</p> <p>Still out in the desert, the Piper sits still attached to Trickster's severed hand. He says it won't be long until he joins him. Suddenly there's a bright light (a Boom Tube) and Piper takes it as the \"light at the end of the tunnel.\"</p> <p>In Bludhaven, Karate Kid still isn't feeling well. Buddy Blank tells them it won't be long until Brother Eye uploads the Atomic Knights. It tells them them that it has discovered a world better suited to its prime directive. Brother Eye plans on going to this world. It plans on leaving Buddy, its creator and his grandson. It says that all other lifeforms are expendable.

They convince him to aid their quest of finding the final godly benefactor to the power of Shazam, Zeus, and forcing him into giving his power to Sabina. They open a portal into Las Vegas, and a horde of magical magical monsters begin the invasion. The monsters are instructed by Sabina to 'take' everyone they see, until one million people have been transformed into the same sort of monsters, as that number of souls is required for the spell that would compel Zeus into giving up his power.</p><p>Freddy Freeman, Marvel, the Justice League and the Shadowpact appear on the scene, and start fighting off the monster army. Freddy assaults Sabina, and takes a beating while she gloats about how she has won, and how meaningless Freddy's efforts were in the end. Freddy reveals that his plan, allowing himself to almost get beaten, works, since that gives him the opportunity to launch both of them into the portal Sabina and her demon horde had exited before. He explains that when beings as powerful as the two of them re-enter a portal only meant to be exited, the portal will collapse and sever the monster army's connection their world, the two of them will die and the power of Shazam will be lost. Freddy considers this to be an acceptable sacrifice as long as it means that Sabina will never wield the power of Shazam. Zareb Babak, who has been guiding Freddy in his trials until now, reveals his identity and transforms into Zeus, king of the gods of magic, and final gatekeeper of the powers of Shazam. He pronounces that Freddy has been judged worthy of the power, and tells him to speak the word. When Freddy does, he transforms into the fully powered Shazam, saving himself while Sabina collapses the portal. The monsters withdraw, and the humans who had been transformed into monsters revert back.</p><p>Zareb/Zeus later explains that Freddy's trials weren't just about proving himself worthy, it was also about the king reclaiming his terran province, and return to his full power. Zeus also explains that for Freddy, fighting criminals would have to take a back seat as keeping the magic of the world in balance would have a higher priority. The story ends with Freddy transforming into Shazam.</p>",

Rewinding the clock to Fury's time in SECRET WAR, follow Fury as he puts together the pieces of his life and starts finding clues to a Secret Invasion that makes him TARGET NUMBER ONE. A major Skrull reveal happens in these pages!</em></p><p>Flashback to several months ago. During the \"Secret War,\" the heroes discover that the Nick Fury they were working with was an L.M.D. (Life Model Decoy). Nick's voice tells them that they are true heroes and they will never see him again. Nick watches through television monitors in his hidden bunker.</p><p>A month later, Nick and the Countess Valentina Allegra Defontaine are enjoying their time together alone, away from S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick figures that maybe they'll just live happily ever after. The next morning, the Countess decides she's going out to get Nick breakfast in bed.</p><p>Nick gets up and activates an invisibility device to follow her. She meets with a strange man in an alley. He asks her if she \"got them.\" She says she'll need at least a week. The man wants the S.H.I.E.L.D. passcodes and Fury eliminated.</p><p>When she returns to their place, Nick is sitting in a chair waiting with a gun. He asks her who she really is. She tells him he's acting crazy. She continues to refuse to answer his question and Nick shoots her in the head. Green blood emerges and Nick is left staring down at the dead body of a Skrull.</p><p>Later he stands on top of the building across from his place and watches with his invisibility device on. He has monitoring devices in place and the language of the men that arrive in the room to claim the body are speaking in the Skrull language.</p><p>Two weeks later on the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, Nick is using a computer in Maria Hill's room as she sleeps. She wakes up with a start. He says he has two things to tell her. He says she is not safe. She is surrounded by people who are out to get her. He tells her to have several life model decoys made of herself and to use them whenever she feels something strange is going down. The second thing he tells her is that he will be watching over her. He says to remember this, unless she is already \"one of them.\" He jumps off the helicarrier.</p><p>Two months later Fury meets with Spider-Woman. He wants her to get back into the good graces of S.H.I.E.L.D. Basically now she will be a triple agent working with him for the sake of mankind. He tells her about the Skrulls. She asks him what he's going to be doing. He says he'll be getting ready. When the Skrulls make their move, he'll be ready to deal with them.</p>",

They also illustrate the link between early manga and American comics and cartoons, and reveal Tezuka's deep fascination with Walt Disney.
