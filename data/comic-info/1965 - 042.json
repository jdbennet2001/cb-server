As she uses her magic to help her search, Zatanna unintentionally opens a portal on the other side of the world, which allows the Warlock to gain access to the earth.</p><p>Magical battles against armies of demons, imps and fiends ensue. Ultimately, Zatanna learns that her father had been banished to the other side of the world, but he has escaped, taking with him the crystal ball that the Warlock had been working on to try and open the Earth portal. Zatara went somewhere he could not be detected, so the Warlock couldn't retrieve the crystal. So when Zatanna appeared, the Warlock was happy to see her as he believed she would lead him to Zatara. However, at the end of the tale, neither heroes nor villain make contact with Zatara.</p><p>Reprinted in <em><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/superman-272-special-all-magic-issue/4000-14043/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-14043\">Superman #272</a></em>, <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america-zatannas-search-1-zatann/4000-119439/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-119439\">Justic<em>e League of America: Zatanna's Search #1</em></a>, <em><a href=\"/green-lantern-archives-6-volume-6/4000-214823/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-214823\">Green Lantern Archives #6</a></em>, <em><a href=\"/showcase-presents-green-lantern-3-volume-three/4000-214826/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-214826\">Showcase Presents: Green Lantern #3</a></em> &amp; <em><a href=\"/green-lantern-omnibus-2-green-lantern-omnibus-vol-/4000-303545/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-303545\">Green Lantern Omnibus #2</a></em>.</p>",
