            "description": "<p><em>Some time ago, Midtown High</em></p><p>After the battle of the Mysterios at Midtown High, a janitor is left to clean up the mess. Principal Harrington is still hiding out in the closet after Spider-Man told him to stay in there. Rather than simply let him out, the janitor kills him.</p><p><em>Now</em></p><p>Spider-Man, Sandman, and Dennis drive to the location that the helmut of the Spider-Man from 2211 is telling them they can find the man that appears to be Ben Parker. They comment that all they need is a talking great dane. Spidey says then he'll be Fred and Dennis calls dibs on Shaggy. Sandman is upset because he doesn't want to be \"one of the broads.\" Spidey tells him he can be Scrappy. Sandman thinks that sounds good until he finds out it's \"the obnoxious sawed-off puppy.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Sandman's father, Floyd Baker, is told that his death sentence has been moved up to this night. Because both Sandman and Spider-Man tried to help him escape, the judge gave a special order to have him face the chair that night.</p><p>Flash and Betty drive home after their disastrous dinner date. Flash seems reluctant to believe Betty when she suggests that perhaps Miss Arrow, the school nurse, doesn't want them together. Just then, she sees Arrow standing outside. When Betty tries to get Flash to see her, they rear-end a parked police car. Arrow is gone but spiders are seen crawling into the sewer.</p><p>The helmut takes the gang to Midtown High. Spider-Man is surprised by this. Inside, the helmut tells him that there are eleven thousand lifeforms inside. They find Principal Harrington with a shotgun. Sandman attacks him right away demanding to know what he has to do with the dead guy in the alley (that his father was accused of killing). Spider-Man tries to stop him and also figure out where all the lifeforms are. He sees some spiders crawl into an air vent.</p><p>Principal Harrington has changed into Sandman and attacks him. As they're off guard, he changes into the Spider-Man from the year 2211. He grabs the helmut and throws it out the window, where it lands by Dennis' van.</p><p>Spider-Man figures out that since there was a Spider-Man and a Hobgoblin in the year 2211, this must be the Chameleon from the same year. It turns out he came with the Hobgoblin from 2211. It turns out that he was in the alley way when the Ben Parker from another dimension stumbled across him. The Chameleon shot him and after taking his DNA through his blood, was able to take his appearance. That's when Floyd Baker came across him and was accused of killing him.</p><p>Then the Chameleon transforms into a huge creature. Dennis comes in with the helmut. Throwing it to Spider-Man, Spidey places it on Chameleon's head and instructs the helmut to adminsiter justice (Spidey had specified \"poetic justice\" in the van).</p><p>As Floyd Baker sits in the electric chair, his body is switched with that of the Chameleon's. Sandman is reunited with his fater.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Captain Britain faces his darkest foe. ALBION has come to save Britain, and in the process, destroy a world! Nocturne is on the ropes, Juggernaut's in love, Dazzler sings the blues, and Sage is stoically beautiful.</em></p><p>In London, Talia continues her therapy a month after her stroke. She tries typing for the first time and is frustrated that she cannot make her body do what she thinks in her mind. She also continues lifting weights to build up her body strength. She feels like half a grown-up and half a baby. Juggernaut comes to take her \"out\" to lunch. Talia tries to be positive knowing that there are people worse off than she is. Finally she gets Cain to tell her what's on his mind. He's been thinking about Albion and Lionheart. They have no records of Albion and Lionheart hasn't been in action for too long. He figures he can try to contact old associates of his to gather information about what they are up to. Talia questions whether or not they will still talk to him now that he's switched sides. As Juggernaut continues to talk to her, she blanks out for a moment seeing a hawk in the sky with Cain's head. Cain snaps her out of it but she says she doesn't know what happened. Cain worries that he was pushing her too far and takes her back in.</p><p>In another part of Britain, Albion and Lionheart meet with Ms. Scicluna. She was able to find them by using her resources at Black Air. She has brought Shadow-X with her, dark versions of the X-Men from another time line. They would like to free their mentor. They figure that if Albion helps them with that, they can help him in return against theri mutual enemies, Excalibur. The dark Jean Grey tries messing with Lionheart's head. She asks if she's Albion's pet and has decided to maker Lionheart her own pet. Lionheart turns around and puts Dark Jean in her place, shutting her out. When they leave, Albion congratulates Lionheart on pushing Jean out of her mind. He had given her a device that would help to keep telepaths out. He also reveals that he only plans on using Shadow-X to defeat Excalibur. He figures that as they fight, Excalibur will be distracted and unaware that the two of them are also involved. He says that then they can take over the world as they embrace and kiss.</p><p>In North London, Cain talks to an old friend named Rollo. As they drink beer and talk, Rollo conveys how his lads would not be happy if they knew he was talking to Juggernaut. He's meeting with him as a favor to Black Tom. He tells Cain that Albion seems full of rage and hatred. He's tempted to leave London but this is his home. He tells Cain that Albion is looking for people that lost their powers on the \"M-Day.\" He's offering them a chance to be reborn. He hands Cain a paper that will get him into the location.</p><p>Later, Juggernaut and Dazzler are practicing at their base. Wisdon watches on and gives critiques on their form. Dazzler seems to be doing well unitl Juggernaut is able to grab her and would be able to give her a death blow.</p><p>Wisdom heads to the kitchen where Brian and a blonde are sitting at the table. He pours himself a cup of coffee then realizes the lady had a gun. He yells to Brian and prepares his dagger knives but the lady already has the drop on him. Then he realizes that it's Sage with blonde hair.</p><p>They discuss the plan. Sage will be going in alone. Pete isn't too keen on the idea because they will have no way to contact her. She says it's the only way and that they can't leave Albion running around. That night, Brian walks Sage nearby to the location of the meeting.</p><p>At the British prison, Shadow-X and Lionheart have easily entered the facility. They tear open the cell leading to where their Professor X is being held. When Lionheart asks them what the plan is, they say to take vengeance on theri enemies, starting with her. They grab her and the Shadow King makes his presence known as Xavier is bound Hannibal Lector style. As the Shadow King is about to enter her mind, he discovers that he can't get in. She then places a device on him that creates an energy field that seals him in the body of Xavier. If his body dies, so will he. Shadow King scoffs at this. He says this isn't the first time he's been challenged. She tells him those days are over and stabs him in the chest. The Shadow King is dead. She turns around with her sword asking who's next when Excalibur makes a grand entrance ready to take them on.</p>",

            "description": "<p><u><i>Overview:</i></u></p><p>X-Factor is trapped in the middle: On the one side, the population of Ex-Mutant Town is in danger of boiling over as the X-Cell, apparently re-empowered by Pietro, endeavor to rally the rank and file against X-Factor. On the other side, the government, ready to move in with everything from armies to Sentinels. Will Madrox decide to tell the truth behind M-Day...and will anyone believe him?</p><p><b>Issue Summary:</b></p><p>Leaning against the wall, the pain of the Blob’s sucker punch to his crotch begins to subside for Rictor. Calling the Blob a <i>pendejo</i>, Rictor explains to Madrox that he is so going down for… Returned to his senses enough, he sees partner cradling his dupe.</p><p>Madrox explains that Fatale poisoned him. When Rictor asks if he can absorb him, Madrox replies that he could, normally. He’d have this dupe make more dupes. It’d diffuse the poison and he could absorb the lot of them with no danger. However, the problem is that his dupes are way too unpredictable these days to do that. And the other problem is that <i>this</i> guy doesn’t want to <i>cooperate</i>! Glancing up at his progenitor, the dupe replies that, to know what lies beyond… would be to know the true enlightenment. He does not seek death… but if it seeks him… he is <i>not</i> afraid.</p><p>Now fully recovered, Rictor pleads with Madrox to get off the dime. If he’s a goner, then he’s a goner. He doesn’t want to sound harsh, but he should say his good-byes and let them go. Finally moved to action, Madrox replies he’s right. Grabbing the dupe’s hand he begins the absorption process… which immediately goes awry. A moment later, the one Jamie Madrox lies prone on the ground of the alley, with the growing ever more anxious Rictor beginning to panic.</p><p>As Guido watches on, the lupine form of Wolfsbane sniffs the alley where she had earlier inadvertently helped a terrorist, one Elijah Cross, escape custody of two FBI agents. As she continues, Guido asks if she’s gotten anything yet. When she does not answer, he begins to ask again, only to have her snap at him. Telling him she heard him, she adds that she also hears him breathing. She hears his heart speeding up! She can practically hear the blood rushing in his veins. “Ye think I canna hear your bloody words? <i>Do</i> ye?” Replying defensively “yeah,” he then adds that, FYI, he woulda been fine with a simple “not yet,” okay?</p><p>Already having returned to the task of tracking, Wolfsbane snaps back that if Guido can do a better job of picking up Cross’ scent… To this, Guido explains that it’s not that, it’s… she just so different when she’s like this. Beyond the whole fur, fangs and claw thing, he means. Every time she’s like this, he get’s worried that she’ll… he doesn’t know… Prefer it? Wolfsbane asks back. Decide to stay like this? Emphatically, Guido replies with a <i>No!</i> but then quickly amends it. Not exact it, it’s more like… Yeah, okay, he finally admits. That’s exactly it. Still scouring the alley floor, the lupine Rahne replies that, if it’s any consolation, <i>she</i> worries about it too. Guido begins to remarks that this is not exactly a consolation when Rahne snarls through lupine fangs, “Got it! Let’s go!!”</p><p>Side by side, Siryn and Monet stand a few feet away from Marrow, who is flanked by Fred J. Dukes – the former Blob – and the ex-mutant once called Fatale. Trying to appeal to reason, especially as Marrow has a steel knife ready to throw with deadly accuracy, Siryn suggests that she stand down – all of them. Put the pig-sticker away, before she blasts them into next week from over here. They have <i>no</i> powers and they have no chance. Of course, Monet adds, even if they <i>had</i> powers, they’d still easily kick their… Yelling out her name, Siryn tells Monet that she’s <i>not</i> helping. To this, Monet asks back what gave her the impression she was <i>trying</i> to?</p><p>Returning her attention to the three members of X-Cell, Monet tells them to come along. There’s some nice people from the government who want to talk with them. Mocking this, the former Blob asks if that’s how it is. Fine. He’ll talk to them in a language they can understand. Moving his hands around his head, the Blob says, <i>Woo woo woo woo! Nyu nyuk nyuk!</i>” When the confused Monet asks what in the hell he is doing, Siryn explains that she thinks he’s implying they’re Stooges. To this, Monet asks if she’s sure. It seems to her he’s having a breakdown of some sort.</p><p>Ignoring Monet, Marrow thrusts an accusatory finger at the pair and calls them Stooges. They bill themselves as the protectors of Mutant Town… but when the government says “jump” they say “how high?” Cross the street to Marrow, Siryn explains that she’s not knowing all the facts, and she’s not about to discuss them with her. Now grabbing the hand belonging to her accusatory finger, she tells Marrow to come along quietly before she gets…</p><p>With lightning speed, a blade appears from the wrist band of the arm Siryn had just grabbed. Muttering a quiet “Sorry, Terry,” Marrow swiftly impales it with a singular forward motion into the astonished Siryn’s shoulder, causing her to fall backwards on her rear. However, recovering quickly from both the surprise and pain, she tells Marrow that she doesn’t <i>know</i> from sorry. Still holding her wounded shoulder, Siryn begins to bring forth a sonic scream, but is quickly silenced by the mass of the Blob, belly-flopping on her. Though no longer possessing the mass he did before, enough is left to smother the scream.</p><p>Taking flight in anger, Monet calls to the three that they’re in it now! No, rejoins Fatale, producing an energy rifle. <i>She</i> is. The energy produces by the firearm knocks Monet backwards in mid-flight.</p><p>Nearby, the Blob tells the two to hurry up. He’s just a big fat guy now! He can’t feel her muzzled forev… The next moment, the Blob finds himself flying upwards at prodigious speed, propelled by the sonic scream of Siryn.</p><p>Some distance away, Rictor recognizes the Siryn’s sonic scream and says so to Madrox, who is still recovering from absorbing his poisoned dupe. Having returned to his feet, barely, Madrox tells Rictor that he’s okay. Absorbing the dupe brought the… the poison to half strength… That was enough… Asked by Rictor if he’s really sure, he replies not really, no. Rictor begins to protest their seeking out Siryn, but Madrox just instructs him to call her Gloria Gaynor. Receiving a “huh?” Madrox explains: He will survive.</p><p>Rictor’s next statement is a change of subjects greater than that for which Madrox prepared. “Incoming!” He has not time to consider Rictor’s meaning before the Blob lands squarely on him, producing several dupes with one impact. Immediately, Madrox states that something tells him this is Siryn’s work.</p><p>Elsewhere, a recovered Monet runs toward Fatale, who tries to fire her rifle against her oncoming foe. As she continues her approach, Monet tells Fatale that that broken arm of hers is going to have company. Unfortunately, one of the dodge blasts of Fatale ricochets against a building an impacts Rictor, having followed the sounds of the battle.</p><p>Unbeknownst of this, Monet asks reached Fatale and delivers a left hook across her chin. Can’t decide though, Monet continues, referring to her threat. Should it be another broken arm… or a broken jaw? She tells Fatale she should feel free to state her preferences. Though Fatale quickly falls, she is not alone, as Marrow launches herself at Monet, blades unsheathed from both of her wrist bands. However, Marrow does not reach her destination, as a sonic scream knocks her off her self-propelled trajectory and into the side of a building, which cracks from the impact.</p><p>Regarding Siryn, Monet tells her that she could have taken her. Last she looked, Theresa responds, they were still a team. She’s more of a one-woman team, Monet quips, in case she hasn’t… Monet’s words trail as she sees Theresa begin to collapse. Grabbing her, Monet notices she’s bleeding badly and suggests she may have severed an artery. Thanking God, Theresa remarks that red goes with her outfit.</p><p>As Monet begins to provide first aid to Theresa, neither woman see the prone Rictor some distance away, nor the figure that picks him up, who slumps him over their shoulder and then carries him away, down an alley.</p><p>Back at X-Factor Investigations HQ, Nicole is nursing a bowl of ice cream, while Layla sits on the counter some distance away. Nicole tells her host that she wanted to die. All her friends were gone. Her aunt and uncle who cared for her as long as she can remember… Interrupting, Layla points out that if Monet hadn’t done what she did…</p><p>She still does know <i>why</i> she’s there, Nicole replies. In the grand scheme of things, Layla explains, neither does she. She has no idea how much that pisses her off. As for why Monet took an interest in her… she had a sister named Nicole. Gave her guilty feelings or instant bonding or something like that.</p><p>Changing subjects, Nicole remarks that the floor is so shiny. To this, Layla explains that it’s pretty <i>new</i>. They had to replace it after she caused the light fixture to fall and electrocute someone she’s didn’t like. Never even saw it coming. Nicole considers this for a moment and then lets go of the spoon and promptly leaves the room. As she does, Layla points out that she forgot her ice cream. To this, Nicole suggests that <i>she</i> eat it. “Okey doke,” Layla replies.</p><p>Having reached their destination, Wolfsbane and Guido find themselves outside a particular house. Remarking that she knew it, Rahne remarks that she knew Pietro would be mixed up in this somehow. He had a feeling too, Guido adds. Remember though… she can’t let him get his hands on her. Not even <i>touch</i> her. She remembers, Rahne replies. And they’ve got to… <i>Down!!!</i></p><p>Unfortunately, Rahne’s warning comes too late, as metallic tendrils wrap themselves around Guido’s mass and begin to pull him up. Wolfsbane tries her best to hold him back but it is not enough, and Guido is pulls skyward. Reaching the roof, Guido sees a mutant whose featureless black skin is adorned by yellow armor, the same color as the tendrils. When Guido exclaims “Oh, it’s <i>you!</i>, the startled man asks if he knows him. Replying “Sure!” Guido states that he’s the guy who’s about t’get a whole big helpin’ of his foot up his butt!</p><p>Through a mouth filled with sharp teeth, the man introduces himself as Nils Styger. He is Abyss. Gudo begins to introduce himself as well, but is not given the chance. As Abyss uses his tendrils to toss Guido across the city skyline, he offers his most heartfelt apologies for not really <i>giving</i> a crap.</p><p>Down below Rahne sees Guido being tossed and yells that she will catch him. However, she quickly spots something out of the corner of her eye and mutter, “Oh you canna be serious.” The site in question is the former mutant called Reaper, carrying the unconscious form of Rictor. When she calls out to him by name, Reaper calls back to “Sinclair” that he’d stay back if she were her. Sadly for him, Rahne replies, he’s not her.</p><p>Tossing Rictor to the ground, and not gently so, Reaper asks Wolfsbane if she’s kidding. When she remarks that he hasn’t got a prayer, Reaper produces two immense blades from his metal arms, rejoining that she thinks she’s cornered the market on prayers, doesn’t she? Then called a “smug bible-thumper” by him, Rahne launches herself at Reaper, deftly avoiding his blades. Stick and stone, she quips. As she leaps over him and kicks him in the back, Rahne tells him he’s embarrassing himself and suggests he get out of her way. And stay out.</p><p>In another deft move, Wolfsbane then swipes her arm to here left, knocking aside a blade which had been hurled at her. Commended on her nice reflexes, Rahne ask who invited her? Emerging from an open window, Callisto hurls three more blades, asking Rahne that it’s good to have powers, isn’t it? Avoiding all three, Rahne replies that, aye, it is.</p><p>Another blade already at the ready, Callisto tells Rahne that she’s on the wrong side of this one. To this, Rahne says she wishes she were; she wishes to <i>God</i> it were so. They shouldn’t be enemies, she then adds. How are they t’survive as a race if they’re at each other’s throats? Considering this, Callisto rejoins that it’s nice to know she’s worried, considering she’s selling out members of her race to the very government that stripped them of their powers! Bearing her eyes on Callisto, Rahne counters that she’s on the wrong side of this.</p><p>Frustration suddenly gets the better of Rahne, who then angrily says that she <i>knew</i> they shouldn’t have kept the truth of this secret! Look what it’s <i>led</i> to! Asking Callisto to listen to her, she says that the fact of the matter behind M-Day is that… Wolfsbane words trail as a hand appears from nowhere, grasping her by the arm. As Rahne yells in pain, her arm beginning to smolder, at the other end of the hand is a resolute Pietro. A moment later, Rahne Sinclair has returned to her human form and is unconscious on the sidewalk.</p><p>When the agape Callisto asks what he did to her, Pietro explains, “what he could.” As he returns his glove to his hand, he instructs her to get out of there. To this, Reaper suggests that they could use her as a hostage of something. When Pietro vetoes this, Reaper replies that he’s not giving the orders here…</p><p>Interrupting, Pietro asks through gritted teeth if they want his help. If so, then yes… he <i>is</i> giving the orders. As such, he orders Reaper to get rid of her, however he needs to. It makes no difference to him. But, if he won’t attend to it, then <i>he’ll</i> dispose of her… perhaps <i>permanently</i>. Depends on his mood. It’s Reaper’s choice. Silently Reaper and Callisto look at each other, exchanging their thoughts through their eyes. They then turn their gaze down to the unconscious Rahne, lying between them.</p><p>A few moments later, after they have tossed her down a manhole and into the sewers below, Reaper remarks that that’s strange. When Callisto asks what he means, he shows her a piece of paper that fell out of her pocket. It said she should go climb down a manhole at the intersection of Bachman and 5th. To this, Callisto states that the address is wrong, but close enough for Jazz.</p><p>Nearby, Pietro finishes the job of dragging the unconscious Rictor into his building. Speaking to him, Peitro tells him that, once he’s conscious, he’ll explain how he fits into all this. He thinks he’ll find it <i>very</i> exciting.</p><p>Back at X-Factor, Theresa yells at Madrox that it hurts. Topless, she sits on a stool at the counter, covering herself with a towel while Jamie Madrox tries to sew her shoulder wound shut. When she reiterates the pain, he reminds her that if she’d given time for the Novocaine to kick in… they don’t have time! Theresa rejoins. They got <i>away</i> because of her. Not <i>all</i> of them, Madrox counters. Sitting nearby on the floor, his arms bound behind his back, the Blob yells that he’s not telling them <i>Jack</i>!</p><p>Angry herself, Monet counters that she’s hoping he won’t. <i>Praying</i> that he won’t. Because when he doesn’t, Madrox is going to turn her loose on his mind. Won’t he, she asks. Replying that he’ll have no choice <i>but</i> to, Monet asks the Blob if he hears that? No choice.</p><p>Now moving in closer, towering over the wide-eyed Blob, she adds that she’s going to pull the information from his mind, but she doesn’t have time to delicately plumb his depths. So it’s be more like <i>strip</i>-mining. She’ll go through his brain and just mentally rip out <i>everything</i> that looks <i>interesting</i>. Scorched earth. There will be ruins in his skull… unless he tells her the X-Cell’s location, where they got the weapons… everything she wants to know.</p><p>Nearby, Nicole looks on in horror and haltingly asks Layla if it is always like this around here. Actually, Layla replies sleepily, this is a <i>slow</i> day.</p><p>Elsewhere, Rictor returns to the land of the consciousness, finding himself reclined on a couch and being offered a glass of water by Pietro. Sitting on a chair just in front of the couch, Peitro answers Rictors next question of where he is, by pointing out that he should know. He’s been there often enough. Now recognizing it as Pietro’s clinic, he’s told “right the first time.”</p><p>Rictor next asks how he got there, to which Pietro replies that he found him unconscious. He should know he’s always watching out for him. Actually, he adds, his timing couldn’t be better. Beginning to rise, Rictor says that he can’t stand around and chat. There’s some guys he has to… Interrupting, Pietro tells Rictor that he can’t leave yet. Eyeing his host suspiciously, he asks for his meaning. Is he a prisoner there? Telling Rictor not to be absurd, he motion to the door, informing him that he could walk right out that door and he would do nothing to stop him.</p><p>From out in the hall, Marrow, Reaper, Callisto, Abyss and Elijah Cross – all ready for violence – hear Rictor ask for confirmation. Nothing? He’s do nothing to stop him? “Me? Nothing,” Pietro responds. His word of honor.</p><p>However, before he goes, he continues, he thinks he should know something: He’s had an epiphany. Stopped a short distance from the door, Rictor congratulates him. He hopes it was a boy. Ignoring his quip, Pietro tells Rictor that they can save them. <i>All of them</i>. Eyeing back suspiciously once again, Rictor asks all of <i>what</i> them?</p><p>The disenfranchised, Pietro explains. The disinherited. The former mutants. Fate brought the two of them together for a purpose. God has shown him the way to help them all. Considering this, Rictor recalls their previous conversation. He thought he said the ones he couldn’t help weren’t worthy. True, Pietro replies. They <i>weren’t</i>… but they could be. They can be purified… through <i>him</i>. “Me?” Rictor asks.</p><p>Evolution, Peitro explains, stems from nature. He has a connection to nature, to Mother Earth herself. Had, Rictor reminds him. Have, Pietro responds. Powers or no, he continues, it resides within him still. And, with his help, that connection can be used for salvation. Thanks to him… as a race… they can survive.</p><p>Considering this, Rictor’s hand lingers on the doorknob to the outside. Finally, he removes it. “Survive, huh. Tell me more.”</p>",

            "description": "<i>Piper and Trickster continue treking through the desert!  Holly and Harley discover who is living in a cave!  Forager continues to try to kill Jimmy as they become more physical!  Will another New God die? Plus, more DC villains origin backup stories, featuring this month The Origin of the Scarecrow by Scott Beatty and Kelley Jones! The COUNTDOWN TO FINAL CRISIS continues!</i><p>Walking through the Chihuahuan Desert, Piper discovers what a \"drag\" Trickster can still be.  Despite Trickster's recent injury, Piper continues to talk to him.  The heat is starting to get to him as the Trickster begins \"talking\" back.  They soon surprisingly find an oasis and are able to get some water.</p><p>On Earth-51, the \"Challengers\" are trying to get closer to finding Ray Palmer.  It seems this is an idealistic world.  Liberty Belle is the President and Superman's identity is public knowledge.  \"Bob\" is worried about the fact that they haven't been discovered yet by the other Monitors.</p><p>On Themyscira, it is reported to Granny Goodness that Holly and Harley are missing.  The Amazon is surprised that Granny already knew.  Those around her reveal themselves to be Lashina, Mad Harriet and Stompa of the Female Furies.</p><p>Inside the cave that Harley wanted to investigate with Holly, they find a stash of Amazonian weapons.  Just as they notice signs that someone is living there, they are soon greeted by Hippolyta.  They soon settle things before anyone is injured.  They tell Hippolyta that \"Athena\" has been leading the fake Amazons.  A hellhound soon finds them and Hippolyta easily takes it out.  Knowing that it would have been a difficult kill for them, she suggests they take it back to \"Athena\" to show their skill and to explain where they've been.</p><p>Granny (as Athena) is impressed.  She is further impressed when they tell her about the stash of weapons they found.  They are to show them where the weapons were.</p><p>With the help of a burro that Piper was able to call up, Trickster can now be carried on its back.  \"Trickster\" asks Piper why is he still dragging him around.  He says if he were in Piper's position, he would've dumped him long ago.  Piper doesn't believe that.  That night, after Piper has set up a camp, he contemplates finally using a blade to get the cuff off of Trickster's wrist.</p><p>ON Apokolips, Forager is still trying to kill Jimmy after he freed her.  He doesn't know how to stop her.  He tries talking to her but it doesn't do any good.  Thinking that he needs a way to get her to see things clearly before anyone else shows up and kills them, there is a sudden series of pings.  This snaps Forager out of her killing mode and she is surprised to see Jimmy.  She asks him about the ping and where did he get a Mother Box.  He tells her that he doesn't have one.</p><p>Before they can talk further, Bernadeth (Desaad's sister) comes in ready to work on them both.  Jimmy's powers defend them against Bernadeth.  Unfortunately, the pain she receives only serves to turn her on.  As she is about to strike again, Jimmy blasts the blade out of Bernadeth's hands.  With his eyes glowing, Forager says that she recognizes the pattern in his eyes.  She mentions her Mother Box again as a Boom Tube is opened and they make their escape.<br /></p><p>As Bernadeth sits reeling from Jimmy's strike, a shadowed figure comes up claiming to be the Harbinger.  Bernadeth recognizes him as he says he is going to bring an end to the Fourth World as his hand begins to build up energy.</p><p>Jimmy and Forager land in Metropolis.  Forager tells him that she saw the Source in his eyes.  Jimmy, still surprised that he managed to open a Boom Tube, wonders if he is turning into a New God.  Forager believes he is turning into something more unique.  Together in the moonlight, they begin to kiss.</p>",
