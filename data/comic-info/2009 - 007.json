            "description": "<p><em><strong>The dramatic finale to the epic, seven-part saga of the DC multiverse concludes with an apocalyptic battle for the soul of humanity that must be seen to be believed! Can the heroes of 52 Earths save the multiverse? And is the only way to save it, to change it forever?</strong></em></p><p>On an alternate Earth the African American President of the United States gathers information on the Red skies surrounding his Earth he goes into the oval office and removes his suit showing a Superman costume underneath making him that world's Superman. This Superman and that world's Wonder Woman Nubia see a mysterious and possibly supernatural spaceship arrive. Inside the spaceship is Renee Montoya (wearing her Question mask, hat and a new costume), the Captain Marvel of Earth 5 and other alternate Supermen.</p><p>The Watchtower is shown as the universe breaks down Lois Lane narrarates as she recalls how Earth 44 collided with their Earth and battled with the Metal Men and Doc Tornado of Earth 44.</p><p>Lois Lane then says how she wrote the final edition of the Daily Planet that details the entire story of the battle with Darkseid it is placed inside a rocket and blasted off. The final events of the battle with Darkseid are shown:</p><p>Superman still holding Batman's body confronts an injured Darkseid but is hesitant to do anything to him as he recognizes the body he is in as Dan Turpin's Superman is then attacked by all the humans in Darkseid's control. Darkseid pulls out a gun about to shoot Superman with it Barry Allen and Wally West lead The Black Racer to Darkseid which severely injures Darkseid further. Multiple events are then shown occuring at the same time. The returned Aquaman is shown defending Atlantis. Checkmate fights off Darkseid's forces until their defeat. Ray Palmer and Ryan Choi attempt to reach a alternate Earth but are held back as the interdimensional tunnel is damaged and shuts down. Black Canary and a cured Green Arrow are seen drifting inside a powered down Watchtower as The Ray uses his powers to write the freedom symbol over the planet. The Super Young Team try to survive as the interdimensional tunnel breaks down further. Hawkman and Hawkgirl attempt to stop the tunnel before it closed down are caught in its explosion.</p><p>At Some point after this ended Superman and the remaining heroes and villains began building the Miracle Machine. As Supergirl told various surviving children in the Watchtower the defeat of Darkseid:</p><p>Renee Montoya arrives on New Earth with the group of alternate Supermen Renee then tells Overman that his cousin Overgirl died he is then seen clutching her body crying.</p><p>Superman who is staring down Darkseid is confronted by the Female Furies (an Anti-Life infected Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Giganta and Batwoman) and the Justifiers. Then Lex Luthor and Sivana along with the mind controlled Secret Society arrive to help Superman and The Resistance against Darkseid's forces. At Some unspecified point in the battle Wonder Woman was freed and strung Darkseid with her magic lasso removing him from Dan Turpin's body.</p><p>Inside The Watchtower all the survivors are transformed into microscopic cells and placed inside a freezer in the Miracle Machine except Superman who is to activate the Miracle Machine and Supergirl who leaves to check on any other survivor.</p><p>Superman is then confronted by the bare consciousness of Darkseid without a body. Superman tells Darkseid of how everything is just vibrations and how they can be canceled out by counter-vibrations he screams some musical note and kills Darkseid.</p><p>Superman then sees Metron's abandoned Mobius Chair and pulls Element X from the chair something that can take any shape he loads it up in the Miracle Machine but hears then sees Mandrakk the Dark Monitor accompanied by a now vampire Ultraman holding Supergirl over his shoulder. Mandrakk tells Superman that he now wishes to feed on Superman as he shows The Spectre and The Radiant defeated and drained of power saying there is no light to power the Miracle Machine. Superman then uses the solar energy in his body to activate the Miracle Machine. As the Green Lantern Corps come near Earth the alternate Supermen all arrive to fight Ultraman and the Mandrakk.</p><p>The events are then narrarated by Nix Uaton he arrived the alternate Supermen and used his powers to summon Captain Carrot and the Zoo Crew, the Last Angel army of God, The Forever People of the Fifth World (The Super Young Team) and the Green Lantern Corps all of whom simultaneously blast Mandrakk and Ultraman with their combined powers with Hal Jordan delivering the killing blow to Mandrakk.</p><p>Lois Lane narrarates as she describes Earth surviving the Crisis and life beginning to recover.</p><p>Narraration then goes to Nix Uaton who describes to the other Monitors that the Multiverse returned to normal by the alternate Supermen and Green Lantern Corps.</p><p>He explains that Apokolips was recreated as New Genesis and home to the Forth World and the returned good New Gods and implies that they will that they will guide the recently destroyed Earth-51 (now home to Kamandi and many of the animal people of Command-D gene station), restoring it to prosperity and peace. Nix then says that it was the interference of the Monitors that threatened the Multiverse and says the time has come for them to step down.</p><p>Nix Uotan then goes to talk to Weeja Dell, his former lover, and says that the Final Crisis is for the Monitors he tells her how her face in his dreams gave him strength and kisses her on her forehead as the Monitors' realm starts to end. She asks what did Superman wish for with the Miracle Machine and he says \"a happy ending\". Nix then wakes up in his room on New Earth and hears on the radio that the people of Earth discovered the Multiverse.</p><p>Anthro is seen as an old man still holding the torch Metron gave him and still wearing the freedom symbol on his face he carves the freedom symbol on a cave wall in the distance there is the rocket ship launched from the Watchtower. Anthro smiles then passes away as Batman appears. He places his belt on Anthro and starts carving the Batman symbol on the cave wall.</p>",

Then Bob said what he really was doing was asking Deadpool for protection because he knows he can't beat him. Deadpool then hid in the bathroom when Tigershark came in. Bob told Tigershark that he killed him and he was in the bathroom. When Tigershark entered the bathroom Deadpool fought Tigershark and won. Bob then told Deadpool that Norman Osborne hired them both to kill him. So Deadpool sent Norman a fax saying he wants 1 billion dollars in the next 12 hours and also said he killed Bob.</p>",

            "description": "<p>(Malibu, morning)</p><p>Klara, Molly and Victor are playing a game on their Nintendo Wii, each snowboarding down a mountain in search of victory. As Molly and Victor fight (Molly believes Victor is cheating), Klara actually does cheat by manipulating the plant beside the television to block the screen so only she can see. Klara enjoys cheating.</p><p>As they continue their downhill race, Chase appears on the staircase, yawning but ready to go to work. Everyone ignores him. They’re much more focused on the game. He notes their lack of excitement at his appearance and wanders through the room carrying a box of donuts. He talks to himself in a jokingly sarcastic fashion, telling them not to worry. He is the one, after all, putting food on their table <i>and</i> game controllers in their hands. None of the others pay attention to Chase at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nico and Karolina take a nice morning stroll along one of Malibu’s golden beaches. Karolina reveals how every once in a while \"it\" always hits her; the fact that it wasn't so long ago they were just kids, living with their parents, eating their food and driving their cars. Nico is surprised Karolina got to drive their car, although Karolina smiles and replies that it wasn’t with their permission. She snuck it out once, drove to Taco Bell and back - by doing this, she felt she left a footprint on the Earth. Nico holds her hand and tells her the only footprints she's leaving on that planet are the ones she's making in the sand. Nico is happy to see Karolina smiling. Karolina admits that she thought the pain would never go away, but it does. Things do get better. Nico says that Xavin would be proud of her.</p><p>As the two walk back up the drive to their home, they notice Chase driving away in the VW Steinbus. Nico can’t believe that he’s actually sticking with the job. Before Karolina can make a remark, Chase flicks a switch to unleash the rockets from the back. He kicks the bus into rocket mode and takes off at speed. A trail of smoke envelopes the two girls and Nico waves her unseen fist at him, yelling about how he's blowing cover. Karolina simply sighs.</p><p>(meanwhile)</p><p>Over at KZIT, DJ Val Rhymin is with \"Mother\" - a stocky guy with a crow’s head walking stick, slicked-back hair and a goatee. As Val sorts out his mail, he tells Mother he wants zombies. Not the old school ones, new and improved zombies. Mother, however, is struggling to think of a simple spell to attack a common weakness everyone in Los Angeles has. Val suggests the common weakness is debt, but Mother tells him that it has to be a physical weakness everyone in Los Angeles has. But the answer to their problem comes walking through the door in the form of Lydia, Val Rhymin's secretary. Lydia (whose beautiful appearance implies she's undergone plastic surgery in the past) enters the room asking if Val can sign some headshots when he gets the chance. Val almost ignores her but says he’ll get right on it. Mother watches her depart and turns to Val, finally figuring out a common weakness. He asks Val, “How many people in Los Angeles would you say have had plastic surgery?” Val isn’t sure. Maybe half? A grin spreads across Mother’s face as his mind sets his plans in motion.</p><p>(elsewhere)</p><p>Over at the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood, a rock group called the Retching Pigs (nice) are holding a record company executive at gunpoint because he had fired them. The lead singer orders his guitar player, Vinnie to strum his guitar - Vinnie's super-powered guitar sends a rippling wave through the air, knocking most of the S.W.A.T. team nearby unconscious. It is at this point, however, where Klara Prast's grey eyes light up as she whispers, \"a sound garden\".</p><p>The Runaways, having arrived on the scene watch as plants begin to grow around the Capital Records Building around the Retching Pigs. Nico and Klara stand on top of the Leapfrog, to where Nico threatens to light a spell upon them. The lead singer, however, mockingly calls Nico a \"goth hood ornament\" to the Leapfrog, and calls her an emo. Nico, infuriated, raises her Staff but is stopped by Karolina; just in time, because the Retching Pigs have just begun shooting at the Runaways. Luckily, Karolina creates a solar-energy forcefield in front of them, but Klara is still frightened of the Retching Pigs - they remind her of her old husband.</p><p>When the guns finally run out of bullets, Karolina drops the field and Nico says that it’s their turn. Karolina blasts one of the guys, Molly smashes the ground under another’s feet whilst Nico extends her Staff of One to allow the record company executive to grab it. Klara uses her plants to take Vinnie and another band member out of the fight. It is at this point where S.W.A.T. finally recovers, but the Runaways have already taken out the Retching Pigs. Later on, Nico admits that they executed their task well and showed great teamwork; she thinks they're ready to get back to big time crime fighting. But the only problem, however, is Chase... who is at work.</p><p>(KZIT)</p><p>Chase is at KZIT, flirting with Lydia who seems pretty uninterested. Chase unknowingly mocks Lydia, who becomes more annoyed with him. She tells him the only time she'd be interested is if Chase was rich enough to buy the station. Chase tells her that it’s just a matter of time. As he leaves the room, Mother and Val Rhymin are plotting their next move. They want Lydia to listen to the chorus of a CD fused with magic. Should Lydia (a plastic surgery patient) listen to the CD, she would promptly be turned into a zombie.</p><p>Val enters Lydia's office and waves the CD around, but Lydia's eager to hear it. Lydia enjoys listening to the CD, but her nose suddenly begins to bleed. Lydia falls to the floor and stars to retch, screaming. Val wonders if the spell is working, but Mother enters and orders Lydia to stand up. “Holy Romero!” gasps a shocked, but happy Val as he sees Lydia's face. Mother smiles maliciously, proud the CD worked. Val calls Lydia \"the most disgusting thing [he’s] ever seen.\" Lydia is now taller, but grotesque, with spikes sticking out of her body and her muscles gnarled and twisted. She moans a zombie moan; she is the new leader of their zombie army. Val loves it. “Today Lydia. Tomorrow Los Angeles!”</p><p><b>Notes:</b></p><p>In this issue, \"Mother\" makes his first appearance after being mentioned in issue #3 (October 2008). It isn't explained if he's Val's \"mother\", or if he's just a man named Mother.</p><p>Molly, Victor and Klara play the Nintendo Wii. Val references George Romero's horror films, but wishes for a Robert Rodriguez-type of zombie. YouTube, the bands Nevermore and Soundgarden, the song \"Respect\" by Aretha Franklin and the program GarageBand are all referenced.</p><p>In this issue, Mother references Robert Minoru, Nico's father. He cites the Minorus as Los Angeles' greatest influence in magic. Also, Karolina flies the Leapfrog for the first time - Chase, Victor and briefly Xavin were the only other Runaways who have flown the 'Frog. As Chase flirts with Lydia, it is strongly assured he has gotten over Gert.</p><p>When Marvel solicits released the cover for this issue, it featured Xavin in the space Karolina, Victor and Chase are in. In the actual cover released, Xavin was removed from it.</p>",

            "description": "<b>In the Bleak Midwinter</b><br />On Christmas Eve, in Gotham City, Batman and Robin save two police officers from a car explosion. Robin puts out the fire with an extinguisher while Batman talks with the one of the officers. He tells her that the paramedics are on their way and that they will be okay. Officer Randall tells him that it was a hit and run. Batman asks if she saw who it was. She says yes but starts laughing. He asks what's funny and she says it's Gotham-funny. She said they was hit by a car mixed with a plow and a sleigh. And when it hit them, the driver stole all of the toys that they were taking to underprivileged kids. Batman asks who and she nods towards the idea of him being Santa Claus. <br /> <br />Batman and Robin swing off when the paramedics arrive. Robin says that it was only a matter of time before Santa becomes one of their rogues gallery. Batman says that he must think he's too old for Christmas. They land on a rooftop. Robin says that Christmas is fine but he usually gets expensive things from his mother as gifts. He mentions that the year before, he received a private island. Batman says that used to think it was a big Christmas when Bruce allowed Alfred to make eggnog. They jump towards another roof. Robin says that you get better stuff when you're a real son. Batman sarcastically agrees. <br /> <br />Working on a knocked over car with a plow on the side of the road, is the Santa look-alike. He attempts fixing the engine but hears noises in the background. He says that he didn't mean to make a fuss. He says that he broke his car and the police car. He feels bad that he hurt the officers. He says that they can be fixed and that he really needed the toys. Abuse walks up and sees that Santa may need help. He asks if he can help but, Santa says he's almost done and needs no help. Abuse picks up the car and puts it back on it's tires. Abuse mentions that he is looking for children that are missing and asks if Santa would know anything about it. Santa becomes nervous and hits him with a crowbar. He jumps in his car. He makes a u-turn and knocks Abuse down. Abuse becomes angry. Santa drives away. <br /> <br />At an abandoned children's shelter, Santa stops and takes the bag of toys inside. He checks on the children's room and sees that they are asleep. He then gets to work in his workshop. He starts fixing the toys and putting them on each of the children's beds. Batman and Robin are at the door and reveal that Santa is actually Humpty Dumpty. Batman and Humpty exchange greetings and Batman says that the Broker told him where to look for him. Humpty is really nervous. Batman asks why he left Arkham to take residence in a children's shelter. Humpty says that he just wanted to make a nice home for the children he found. Robin questions the fact that he said found. Batman tells him to let Humpty talk. Humpty says he wanted to bring Christmas to the children. Batman tells him that its great that he has such spirit but he can't do the things he's doing. Robin tells Batman to wait for a minute but, Batman tells him that he's talking. Batman then tells Humpty that he can't run cops off the road. Robin yells to wait for a minute. Batman asks what. Robin notes that the lights are on and everyone is talking and that he just yelled. Batman acknowledges that he noticed this. Robin says that the kids haven't budged at all from their disturbance. He checks on the children and finds that they are all dead. Batman becomes disappointed in Humpty. Robin becomes angry and asks Humpty if he murdered the children. Humpty says no and Batman pulls Robin off of him. He tells Humpty to explain fast. Humpty explains that he found the children in their current state and that he usually gathers broken things from trash dumps and tries to put them back together again. Batman asks if he found the bodies in a dump. Humpty says no and Robin is getting annoyed. Humpty explains that he found them in the river and kept finding more and more each day. He was upset that they were killed near Christmas, that he hoped to give them a Christmas and hopefully it would fix them. Batman tells him that he couldn't put them back together again. Humpty agrees. Robin calls for someone to come pick up the bodies. Batman asks if Robin is okay while he hands him the phone. Robin then throws up in a bucket. Batman tells the police where to go. Robin swears that he will avenge the children's deaths. Batman agrees and says that it will both of them to do it. Abuse is watching from outside. He walks away in the snow. He thinks to himself about the situation. He arrives at a Catholic orphanage. A nun sees him walk inside and follows him. She looks in a young boy's room. She asks if he had seen a man but he says no. The nun walks away. Abuse's hat, jacket, and brass knuckles are hidden in the young boy's room. Another nun tells her to get to midnight mass. The nuns begin singing in the choir. <br /> <br />Beneath the orphanage, boys are forced to fight each other to the death while criminals bet on the winners. Mr. Zsasz turns out to be the ring leader.<br /><br /><b>Face Off</b><br />Manhunter sits on a rooftop overlooking the hospital. She wishes for more simplicity in her life.<br /><br />Inside, Dylan Battles is on the hospital bed with a missing leg. He asks if he can get more morphine and where his leg is. A police officer has the leg in a bag and tells him. The doctor pulls out a torch and begins cutting into Dylan's armor. Kate Spencer walks into the room and dismisses the officers. She asks him why he would come to Gotham City to work for the Black Mask. He tells her that he actually works for Two-Face and is trying to frame Black Mask. Kate responds sarcastically and Dylan fights it. She tells him that she needs his help in keeping him out of prison. Commissioner Gordon and Officer Sawyer walk in and ask to talk to Kate. Gordon scolds Kate for having informants that he doesn't know about. Dylan makes fun of her. Kate reassures Gordon that it won't happen again. Gordon tells her that as long as they understand each other, he will let her pass for now. Kate asks to discuss the case with him over dinner sometime. Before he could answer clearly, she implies that he agrees to it. She leaves. Gordon asks Sawyer if he was just asked out on a date and Sawyer tells him that if he doesn't take her up on it, she will. <br /> <br />In Two-Face's hideout, his henchmen explain to him what happened to Dylan. They tell him that Manhunter cut off his leg and they ran away. Two-Face asks if Dylan was alive when they left and they say yes. He calls him an idiot and shoots him in the head. He tells his other henchmen to dump his body in Suicide Swamp. A news report plays. It addresses the situation involving Dylan Battles. Two-Face hopes that Dylan doesn't betray him. <br /> <br />Back in the hospital, Kate asks the nurse how Dylan is. The nurse tells her that he's doped up and will be out for a while. She asks if there will be any luck with his leg and the nurse says no. Kate then asks to speak with the nearest officer. She tells him to not let a soul into Dylan's room that isn't already approved. Not even Batman. She then asks why there is only one guard and not many like she asked. He tells her that there are budget cuts. <br /> <br />Inside Dylan's room, he tries to whisper to his nurse. He thinks Dylan is seeing things but Dylan is just trying to tell him to look behind him. Two-Face sneaks up and pistol whips the nurse and knocks out his tooth. <br /> <br />The officer tells Kate that the guard are switching shifts and gets in the elevator. She hears a crash and runs off to a closet to change into Manhunter. <br /> <br />Two-Face knocks Dylan onto the floor. Dylan threatens him to stay away. Two-Face tells him that it's time to die. Manhunter comes in and tells Two-Face that she was going to say the same thing. Two-Face asks her to come back in five minutes. She tells him no. She says to take it outside and knocks him out the window and jumps after him. They land on a lower rooftop without any problems. Two-Face tells her that he has no problem hitting a girl. She is glad. He tells her that overconfident heroes usually die. She assures him that she won't. She starts beating the crap out of him. He claims to be Harvey Dent and asks for help. She says no and continues beating him. He then offers her a job as an enforcer. She passes. She asks him if that's all he gots and why she shouldn't kill him. Suddenly, Batman and Robin appear. Two-Face gets excited. Batman tells Manhunter that he is going to stop her from killing him. Robin says he isn't and that he wants her to kill him.<br />",

What is the true story behind the cross-shaped scar Kenshin bears on his face? It is the tale of Himura Tomoe, Kenshin's wife who died at his very hands, and of her brother Enishi, who has devoted his entire existence to the goal of watching Kenshin suffer.</i></p><p><i>As one of the deadliest hitokiri in Kyoto several years ago, Kenshin served at the pleasure of Katsura Kogorō of Chōshū. One night, Kenshin found himself doing battle with agents of the shōgunate, and a lone woman from a nearby pub witnessed the scene--but she may not have been there entirely by accident. Betrayal, lost love, revenge: such is the nature of Kenshin's past life. Can he reconcile these old memories in time to prevent the carnage that Enishi is about to visit upon the Kamiya Dojo and those dearest to him?</i></p>",
