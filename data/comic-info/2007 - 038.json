Morrow, Veronica Cale and Dr. Sivana are present for the unveiling. As the monsters are revealed, Cale whispers \"What have we made?\" Chang Tzu reads from the Crime Bible as he introduces three of the Four Horsemen: Azraeuz, Death - a terror with the skull of a giant bull for a head, glowing red eyes, a spiny back and great, feathery wings, as well as furry, horselike legs and a scythe. Roggra, War - a giant robot mounted with machine guns and glowing red eyes. Zorrm, Pestilence - a giant man-shaped creature dressed in black with canisters strapped to his back and connected to his cannonlike arms. Zorrm has a man-like face void of skin, with no lips over grinning teeth and one single glowing red eye.</p><p>The last Horseman, Famine, is conspicuously absent and Chang Tzu reveals that Yuurd the Unknown has already gone.</p><p>Week 38, Day 3.</p><p>Renee is running out of morphine for the ailing Question. She drags him through the snow in a sled, making for a high mountainous city.

Renee is still dragging her friend through the snowy mountains on a sled. A storm ravages the mountains and Renee tries to keep Question warm by putting on his protoskin mask. Renee loses her grip on the sled and finds that Charlie has fallen out of it, the mask is soaked in blood. Renee tears it off and finds that Charlie is finally having a lucid moment. Charlie (Question) asks Renee what the hell she's doing, and tells her that she can't save him. Charlie poses his last question to Renee - \"It's a trick question Renee... not who are you... but who are you going to become?\" Question dies in Renee's arms.</p><p>Includes the Origin of the Red Tornado.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The demon lord Belasco has pulled the Xavier Institute into Limbo, but he's not after the X-Men... he's come for the New X-Men. With their leaders cut off, most of the team captured, and a group of students thrown into the demon infested wastelands, all hope seems lost. But the kids aren't alone in Limbo... and things are about to get much, much worse.</i></p> <p>After Blindfod's scary story, the New X-Men are all doing different things. Mercury is having nightmares, Santo is with Anole and the others that heard the story, X-23 is destroying robots in the danger room, Dust is praying and Elixir and Prodigy are talking. </p> <p>In the background of the last few issues, Elixir had been trying to learn more so he could better use his powers. It seems as if he figured it out. Elixir touches Prodigy's eyes and they begin to work better, he no longer needs his glasses.</p> <p>Outside, a ONE Sentinel watches Hellion and Surge talking. As Surge is yelling at him for going off on a dangerous mission with X-23, the building behind them explodes. Hellion protects them from the initial explosion with a telekinetic shield before trying to go inside. His efforts fail and he tell Surge that there's some kind of barrier blocking him.<br/></p> <p>The scene changes to show the rest of the New X-Men. They're all chained up and surrounded by goblins, trolls and other monsters but their location is unknown. The sky is red and stone building fill the background. None of the children can remember what exactly happened or how they got there, just that there was an explosion. They're also all cut off from their powers. </p> <p>Suddenly, Belasco appears from what looks like a green portal. He speaks to Prodigy and asks them where \"she\" is, but of course, he doesn't know who he's talking about. Nearby, X-23 tells one of the students capable of astral projection to fly up. Laura can see that far above them, further than normal eyes can see, the school is still there. Elixir says he can heal anyone who gets hurt, no matter how bad it is, but Laura tells him that no one will be hurt, just killed.</p> <p>Somewhere else, Santo and a group of younger students stand around confused. One of the kids say they're in limbo and others look to Rockslide for guidance. Blindfold says that \"She\" will come, but not in time. She also says that they must protect Pixie. Just then, they're all attacked by monsters. The students fight but things start to look bad. Rockslide tries to shoot his fists (despite Blindfolds warning that \"It doesn't work anymore\") and explodes. While everyone is distracted by this, Anole gets his arm ripped off. Before the monster can continue its attack, its head is disconnected from its body. Blindfold says, \"She is here. The Darkchild is here.\" Behind the dead monster now stands a girl with hoofs, horns, a tail, a large, blood-covered axe, and a green demon on a chain leash. </p> <p>Back with Belasco and the other New X-Men, Prodigy is questioned some more. Belasco asks where Illyana Rasputin is, and when Prodigy say she's dead, Belasco rips his heart out and throws his body on the ground.</p>",

Flash, Green Lantern John Stewart and Martian Manhunter want to strike right away, destroying the cyborg before it attacks or can even choose to be evil. Batman thinks they should wait and see, but if <i>any</i> action is to be taken, it should be to reprogram it and not destroy it. Wonder Woman and Superman agree with Batman that they should wait to see if Kid Amazo becomes good or evil.</p><p>In a house somewhere else, Professor Ivo and Amazo go over their plans for Kid Amazo. Amazo wants to cause an earthquake at his \"son's\" school to show him the power he could have as well as force him to fight alongside him if the JLA comes. Ivo approves his plan so Amazo immediately attempts it. Amazo finds Kid Amazo as he's about to meet his girlfriend for a movie. She hasn't arrived yet so Kid Amazo tells his father to leave before she gets there since he doesn't want her to see him. Amazo seems hurt as he tunnels underground to start the earthquake. Kid Amazo follows Amazo underground, but isn't exactly sure why. Amazo sets off the earthquake and both of them fly into the sky to see the effects of his work. Kid Amazo is torn. He doesn't know if he should save the humans or let them die. Making up his mind he flies below the earth and reverses what Amazo did. When he tunnels back to the surface he sees a cop. He tries to fly away but he causes the cop to shoot himself. Feeling remorse, Kid Amazo takes he cop to the hospital and along the way he figures out how he's going to handle the Amazo situation. He's going to make him mad.</p><p>At another location, the JLA are still talking about Amazo. Diana says that Kid Amazo's girlfriend might be in danger but Bruce says tries to assure her that the girl won't be in harm's way. J'onn reveals that he's been watching Kid Amazo and reading his mind. He tells Bruce and Diana that the cyborg has been training, practicing using his powers, in a desert. He also tells them that according to what he picked up with a mind scan, Kid Amazo might be insane.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>He used to be one of Peter Parker's most vicious foes: Venom. Now, though, Eddie Brock is weak and powerless. But fortune has smiled on Mr. Brock, putting him in the right place at the right time: The same hospital where May Parker is fighting for her life. With Peter at his most desperate and completely overwhelmed, will Eddie have one final chance to destroy the man he blames for all his life's woes?</p><p>A weak, cancer-ridden Eddie Brock roams the halls of his hospital remembering events from his past. First up is when J. Jonah Jameson came to his journalism school when he was twenty and lectured. Then he remembers interning at the Daily Globe. Next comes the moment when he read that the <em>real</em> Sin Eater had been caught by Spider-Man and Eddie’s career was ruined, followed by his failed suicide attempt and becoming Venom. He quickly relives the countless failures and humiliations as Venom, receiving the news that he had cancer, his conversion and auctioning off of the symbiote, and his second (obviously) failed suicide attempt when he learned that Venom was killing people for no reason. He questions if he’s at the end of his story. </p><p>Eddie then thinks about more recent times, lying awake at night as he’s haunted by memories (or maybe more?) of Venom. Even during the day he’s taunted by his lost companion. The symbiote appears to him in every waking moment, telling him that he’s with him and will remain with him until Eddie dies and gets cut open on the autopsy table and Venom is set free. He sees and reads about recent events in the news, that Spider-Man is Peter Parker and that he’s wearing a black costume again. Eddie starts to think that maybe he’s not done quite yet. He walks down a hallway and see MJ standing by Aunt May in another room and asks how it’s possible that the Parker family has been brought here to him. As he runs away Venom appears and tells him that this is exactly what they’ve been waiting for. </p><p>Inside the room, MJ talks to the unconscious May Parker and says that the bullet was meant for her. Peter pushed her out of the way, but it was meant for her, and if she had gotten hit, she would have survived because she’s younger and stronger. She starts crying and says that she doesn’t think that she and Peter could handle it if she were responsible for May’s death, so she pleads with May to come back to them. </p><p>In an alley somewhere, Peter finds a few thugs picking on a random girl and he lays into them. He tells them that he’s had a long week so he won’t be taking time to chat or anything. He puts them down and webs them all up in less than a minute but he says that it was too long. As he’s walking away, the victim of the mugging asks if Spider-Man should be offering some comfort and not just leaving. He asks if she’s alright and when she says yes he leaves and doesn’t hear (or doesn’t care) when she wonders if he’s alright.</p><p>Spider-Man swings his way over to Madame Webb’s apartment and goes inside to ask for her help. She offers him some coffee and they sit and talk. Spider-Man tells her about everything that’s happened and finally asks the question he came with. He asks her if she can do a séance. Madame Webb says that May isn’t dead, but Spider-Man just wants to reach her and that’s the only thing he could think of. Webb says that it depends on where May is and if she wants to be reached, but she’ll give it a try. She’d already decided she would before Spider-Man even got there. </p><p>Back in his room, Eddie Brock prays for guidance but the only one who talks to him is Venom. Eddie asks him what he should do about his greatest enemy’s family being unprotected in the very same hospital. Venom says it’s moment of truth time. Venom keeps talking and convinces Eddie to do something he already knew he wanted to do. Eddie had ordered a package and Venom tells him to take it out and use it. Eddie opens the box and puts on a black Spider-Man suit. Venom tells him that he’s looking good.</p>",
