Through immeasurable losses and hardships, these suffering victims were finally able to win back their lands. By forming militias and unifying all slaves together under one flag they were eventually able to crush the Tamiran Empire who had conquered the world so long ago. The people now had a fresh start in life. With their new \"free world\" they finally have a chance to get what they've wanted from the very start...peace.</em></p><p><em>Their dreams have been realized. Regions. Countries. Nations have been restored to their former glory. All of Xiltria now works together. With their continued efforts to reshape the world it is a time of prosperity. However, the seeds of evil have endured. In the underbelly of society, subtle remnants of the exiled Tamiran Empire still live on...and are starting to give way towards a new threat.</em></p><p><em>It's been nearly eight years since the citizens of Xiltria regained their freedom.

Now, a decade later, Mammoth is ready to return to the family, title and country he’d left behind. It's a land in which man, beast and champion stride a battlefield and either raise their gloves in triumph or taste canvas in defeat. But before he can return, Mammoth has to escape. And every escape has a story. This, then, is the beginning of that story. KINGS AND CANVAS, an original boxing fantasy tale, explores the lengths a man will go to find purpose after life, liberty and career have passed him by. \"Game of Thrones meets Rocky\"—but with sea dwarves, pirate referees and talking, boxing dragons—KINGS AND CANVAS journeys across the frontier of a changed America in which honor is gained not by using guns or swords, but rather fists, wits and the courage to change.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The all-new Belladonna epic begins here! It's the story of a Viking warrior and her army of shield maidens in a century of massive upheaval in the Celtic north. Belladonna uses her ferocious bloodlust and supernatural strength to wage war against the cruel Picts and mythical beasts, surrounded by a bleak and unforgiving landscape. But bloodletting and supernatural beasts aside, Belladonna is also a meticulously researched evocation of the pre-Roman British isles during the 9th century. It was a century of blood and fire, kingdoms rising and falling in the contest between the Vikings and the Picts, with Belladonna and her irregular war-party of women fighters are caught in the middle. With the breathtaking art of Ignacio Calero, this sweeping, sexy epic is not one to be missed! This super-size first issue also features a cover gallery of her previous series as well as an archive story from Raulo Caceres in color for the first time!</em></p><p><em>Don't miss the fantastic array of seductive covers with this issue including Regular Cover by Ignacio Calero, Shield Maiden, Blood Lust &amp; Warrior Women by Jose Luis, Celtic Deco by Michael DiPascale, ultra-collectable Costume Change 6 cover set (with sexy topless and nude covers included) limited to just 250 sets by Christian Zanier, and a Pure Art Retailer Order Incentive by Ron Adrian.
