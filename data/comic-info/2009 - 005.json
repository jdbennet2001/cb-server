The two strongest military organizations still around are in a desperate battle to get that case back. A powerful African prince offers the Big Nuclear Apple's hardest bounty hunter, the mysterious Zero, a free ride to the land of his dreams if he can track it down -- but that means returning to Zero's old stomping grounds, the Twin Towers. Things start going incredibly awry once the exiled Zero starts prowling his former turf. He'll have to face some old enemies -- and some old ghosts -- if he's going to get out alive, with or without the briefcase!

Despite her best efforts, Sachiko meets with much opposition from the new teacher, and the Azumas have to cope with Hikaru acting out as a result of the stressful changes at school. Moreover, when the time comes for the family to decide on Hikaru’s junior high, the local education administrators seem to think that a school for the disabled is the best fit for Hikaru, partly because of his recent behavior.
