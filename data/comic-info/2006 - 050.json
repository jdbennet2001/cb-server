            "description": "<p><em>In the landmark fiftieth issue of the critically acclaimed series, the person, people or thing behind the plague that killed every man except for Yorick Brown is finally revealed! And with just ten more issues left, it's the beginning of the end...</em></p><p> </p><p>The book opens with Allison as a little girl getting allergy shots from her father and his lover. The mistress begins to tell her about a greater conciousness amongst a species that is usually passed off as instinct. Neither her Father or Allison Mann believe her. 25 years later in the present day, Allison Mann is laying on the floor bleeding from her crotch, while 355 has a gun to Roses head. They are arguing when Dr. Mann says in a weak voice that her Mother is in Hong Kong. Figuring that is her mother was good enough to patch Rose together, she can also help Allison. On a submarine, Alter, the head of the Israeli army is visited by one of her subordinates. She tells Alter that the photo that she has been using to recruit women, has been faked. Alter gets mad at her and threatens to kill her. In an ambulance they are speeding toward Hong Kong trying to get Dr. Mann to help in time. When they get out, Yorrick gets out, and is quickly stung by something and falls unconcious. Soon after Rose and 355 are also hit, before she falls, 355 sees the ninja Toyota coming toward her. In a hospital. Allison wakes up to find her Mother standing over her. She learns that her mom had to remove her uterus to save her life, and then tells her the same thing happened to her fathers old assisstant. She had also tried to carry a human clone. Except unlike Dr. Mann, the assisstant died. When she hears that Allison wonders who the ninja was working for if Ming was dead. That is when her father comes out from behind the curtain. He tells her he is alive the same way and reason Yorrick is alive. He then tells her the plague is the fault of him and his offspring. He shows her that he has been cloning Dr. Mann for years.</p>",
