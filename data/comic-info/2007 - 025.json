Storm mentions that a head of state of another country shouldn't comment on U.S. domestic policy. Reed tries making implications that in Wakanda, they are already monitoring meta-human abilities with the free health care program. He also tries to push the idea that young powered individuals need guidance just as Xavier tried doing. Storm doesn't give in to his bating.</p><p>At Ryker's Island, at one of the gateways for the Negative Zone prison, Captain America and his team make their move. At the same time, Black Panther tells the Wakandan Embassy to evacuate. Soon, the heroes are teleported over New York courtesy of Cloak (after the beginning of the fight not seen here).</p><p>As the battle wages on, the Thor clone and Storm both arrive. The clone tries fighting but mostly causes damage to the embassy and its surroundings. Storm is determined to show the clone that it is not a true wielder of the elements. Eventually Hercules arrives and offers his assistance. Off panel, he destroys the clone.</p><p>The battle seems to have calmed down some. Black Panther finds Storm to tell her that Captain America has surrendered.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Leaping from the final pages of Civil War, this is the *only place* readers can find out what happens next in the life of CAPTAIN AMERICA! Trust us, folks, this over-sized 25th issue will stun readers and send shock waves through the entire Marvel Universe for the next year!</em></p><p>Captain America's surrender during the \"Civil War\" is on the news. The coverage is now focusing on the arraignment of Steve Rogers. The hearing is to take place in New York rather than in front of a military tribunal. It will also be broadcast live on all networks. A crowd of supporters and protesters has gathered outside the courthouse.</p><p>Agent 13, Sharon Carter is among the crowd. She is in contact with Nick Fury who seems to have a plan for something. Sharon recalls her first memories of Captain America and their time together as partners and lovers.</p><p>Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes is also among the crowd. He too recalls his first meeting of Cap and how you had no choice but to look up to him.</p><p>Steve Rogers finally arrives escorted by the US Marshalls. The crowd shouts outs questions and statements of support and disdain. One member even throws a tomato that hits him in the face asking, \"Since when does Captain America surrender?!\" As Rogers shakes off the mess, he notices a red dot appear on the Marshall in front of him. Looking up, he finds the source in a building window across the street. Dr. Faustus and the Red Skull (in Aleksander Lukin's body notice that Rogers has found the sniper as they watch on television. The Skull insists that their plan stay in motion as they have done what they could to get the Rogers transferred to New York.</p><p>Cap yells, \"Look out!\" and pushes the marshal out of the way. The sniper's bullet shoots through his upper chest. The crowd panics. Sharon tries to get to Steve. Barnes also tries to work his way through the crowd. As Sharon is about to reach Steve, a gun is seen and three more shots, at close range, hit Captain America.</p><p>Weak from the shots, Rogers still asks Sharon to get the crowd to safety. Winter Soldier jumps through the window where the sniper shot came from. He is too late. Just then, Falcon flies into the building pinning Barnes against the wall thinking he was responsible. Winter Soldier quickly convinces him otherwise. Fury is able to track where the sniper went, a news copter has swooped down to pick him up. Barnes asks Falcon to carry him out as Steve Rogers is taken by an ambulance.</p><p>In the copter, Tombstone sees that they are being followed. Barnes shoots at them which causes the copter to go down. Tombstone simply jumps out towards Falcon and Winter Soldier as gravity carries them down. Barnes beats Tombstone down as Sin, the Red Skull's daughter observes. She calls her father and he tells her to move on to the next part of the plan. She is seen entering the nearby hospital dressed as a nurse.</p><p>Falcon tells Barnes to leave before S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives, leaving Tombstone with them. As S.H.I.E.L.D. soldier arrive and order Falcon to stand down, he does so willingly to go to Steve's side. As the ambulance arrives at the hospital, the news announces that Steve Rogers has been pronounced dead on arrival. Sharon and Falcon can be seen sitting in a waiting room.</p><p>Later Sharon goes to the restroom to splash some water on her face. At that moment, Sin walks in telling her the doctor wanted her to tell Sharon something. Dr. Faustus wanted her to tell her to \"remember.\" Sharon's eyes roll back as she goes back to when the sniper bullet was fired. She sees herself working through the crowd to get to Steve's side. Then she sees herself hold a gun up to Steve's gut and fire three times. She crumbles to the floor in tears over what she has done.</p><p>On a hospital bed, covered in a bloody sheet, the lifeless body of Captain America is lying there.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The issue starts with two mysterious voices talking about The Runaways. The intro provides information about each member of the team and a brief history for new readers or old ones who've forgotten.</p><p>After the intro, the team is shown eating at a fancy restaurant in New York where they await an unnamed man who was one of the voices in the intro. The man is quickly revealed to be The Kingpin. The Runaways, claiming to be the new Pride, demand protection while they are in New York. Kingpin tells them he can have them killed, but he gives them a place to stay anyway. But only if they steal something for him.</p><p>Later, in the house that the Kingpin has given them, the Runaways discuss their new situation. Victor thinks they're turning evil by dealing with Fisk, Nico disagrees, Chase is just happy to have a place to stay, and Xavin admires the man for being a leader. Xavin praises Fisk for being a man who knows who he is and doesn't have to hide it, but turns from male to female as he does so.</p><p>The group is still unsure of what they'll do when the scene changes to show an old woman, in her house, talking to a very muscular man with lots of scars and a large sword. They talk about the Runaways <em>and</em> the Kingpin being oblivious to some plan the big man has concocted, but nothing specific is said.</p><p>Back at the Runaway's house, Nico and Karolina talk and Nico ends up questioning her relationship with, and the sexuality of, Xavin. Karolina gets mad and flies off and the next frame skips forward a little and shows the Runaways crashing their vehicle into a building. They've decided to work for the Kingpin and steal the artifact he asked for.</p><p>Things start off bumpy enough, with the crash landing and Xavin's difficulty of getting everyone to the right building, but it only gets worse. While most of the team in the building and Chase (and Old Lace) standing guard outside, a dark figure launches a rocket at the building. Chase is saved from a fall to his death by Old Lace, and inside, Xavin and Molly create an escape route by breaking the floor. They escape with the artifact but find themselves staring up at the guns of the Punisher. Not only that, but the mysterious man with the sword is right behind him and he looks mad.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>X-Factor Investigations joins the search for the missing mutant baby! Rictor infiltrates the Purifiers’ church in hopes of learning what they know about the kidnapping, but the secrets he uncovers surpass his wildest nightmares.</p><p>Meanwhile, Madrox and Layla visit Forge and learn the terrible truth about the future of mutantkind.</p><p>In Chelsea,New York, the Purifiers gather in their church to discuss the events in Alaska. They have decided that they have to step things up now that the X-Men have become aware of the mutant infant and are conducting their own search.</p><p>From above comes a low growl. Wolfsbane is sitting in the rafters looking down at them. She lunges and attacks one. The rest of the men in the room draw their guns but the man attack pleads for them not to shoot out of fear of getting shot. Wolfsbane throws the man at them and tries to escape. They chase her on the streets with their guns out. Walking down the street is man minding his own business. The Purifiers try to warn him to get out of the way. He responds by pulling out a gun of his own and shooting Wolfsbane, point blank, a few times. A pick-up truck pulls up and yells for Wolfsbane to get in. The man that shot her asks the Purifiers if that was what he thinks it was. They tell him that, yeah, it was a mutant. They tell him that the streets a crawling with them and they've been looking for men like him. They ask his name and he says it's Joaqauin Murrieta, but his friends call him Jake.</p><p>The truck is being driven by Siryn. She tells Cyclops that Rictor has managed to convince the Purifiers and that he's \"in.\" Rahne is okay. She wasn't shot with real bullets. As Scott receives word on this, X-23 and Rockslide decide they need to speak with him.</p><p>In Dallas, Texas, Madrox and Layla pay a visit to Forge's place. When he introduces her to Forge, he tells him that \"she knows stuff.\" Layla comments how it's funny that she doesn't have to say that anymore. People say it for her. As Madrox asks Forge if he's going to let them in out of the rain, she walks right through what is a hologram of him. Forge asks if this is part of the \"stuff\" she knows. She tells him simply that he didn't have a shadow. Half of the stuff she knows if just from paying attention.</p><p>Inside, Forge complains that Jamie is dripping on his floor. Layla tells him he could have shared her Hello Kitty umbrella. He says he has an image to protect. Forge asks Jamie how much has Scott told him about their plan. Not much. Forge has basically built a sort of time machine. He calls it a Chronal Tracer. He tells them that time branches off in infinite directions. Since M-Day, it's only branched out in two directions for mutants. They need Jamie to investigate them.</p><p>In a hospital in Santa Cruz, a man is brought into the emergency room after seemingly walking in front of an ambulance. The man turns out to Wolverine looking for Amelia Voght (who is working at the hospital). When she recognizes him, she turns to mist and escapes into the air ducts. Outside, Storm manages to suck Amelia out. She and Nightcrawler tell her they want to know were the Marauders are since the Acolytes used to have close ties to them. Storm tells her she can't protect them. Amelia tells them that she wasn't protecting the Marauders but rather them. She says fine, she'll tell them where they are but it won't be on her conscience.</p><p>Jamie asks Forge if the plan is to send two of his dupes into the the time streams and have them return with information. Forge says that's basically it. Jamie is a little hesitant since his dupes haven't been too stable lately. The two produced seem fine. The first is off with no problem. When the second is to be sent out, Layla runs into the Chronal Tracer, grabbing the dupe just as it activates. Jamie yells to Forge to reverse the machine. Forge tells him he can't. Both of the trips were one-way. Jamie is ticked off now. He asks how are his dupes supposed to come back. Forge tells him they're not. A message had been sent to them psionically into their brain cells. When they got the information, they would kill themselves and the information would be absorbed into Jamie. He grabs Forge and is about to hit him for leaving Layla stuck. Before he can hit him, his eyes roll back and he passes out.</p><p>The \"new\" X-Men are having words with Cyclops. They're not too happy that there's a \"war\" going on and they aren't able to do anything. When Rockslide stands in front of Scott challenging him about whether they have what it takes, Scott simply sends him flying back with an optic blast to put him in his place. He tells them they will help when they are told where and when the time comes. If they don't like it, they can just leave. Hellion asks if he's serious about just letting them walk out the door. Scott says yes. Then they will go after them and drag them back to chew them out for deserting their species in this time of need.</p><p>At the Purifiers' church, Rictor, or Jake as he's now known, is scanned and revealed to be a human. When he asks where they got the technology, they just tell him they recently acquired it. There is more to their operations than a simple church. A hidden room reveals an arsenal of weapons. As Rictor/Jake stands in surprise, they tell him this is nothing. This is just one of their smaller bases. He should see the one they have in Washington.</p>",
