            "description": "<i>Stranded on modern-day Cybertron, Ironhide discovers he's the only functioning life-form on the planet. Oh, except for the Swarm. Writer Mike Costa continues to put the fallen (now resurrected?!) Autobot through some strange paces, with stunning art by Casey Coller.</i> <i>   </i><br/> <br/>Ironhide finds himself at the racetracks of Cybertron which were famous long ago. As he stands there, he has memories of how the announcers said that all sentient life in the universe would focus on the races when they came on no matter what. Ironhide feels that everything other than himself is dead as he tries to open a door which has no power left. He then has a flashback from long ago when he worked as security for the racetrack in which Drag Strip was a racer entering the tracks and a bot tried to kill him but Ironhide stopped and arrested the bot. As the bot was arrested he told Ironhide that bots like him will be the cause of them losing everything. Then his boss came over and asked what was going on and Ironhide explained and also said that the bot was saying something about how he'd wake up one day and he and his boss laughed at this. Then it's back in the modern day and Ironhide is shocked by everything he sees. He describes the place like it was hit by a bomb and notices that radiation levels are also very high. He then starts feeling as though he's going crazy because he's talking to himself when he suddenly hears something moving and gains hope that there's someone else there. However, as he goes to where he heard the sounds coming from he finds nothing and really starts to doubt his sanity when all of a sudden he's attacked by a creature. He kills it but then gets attacked by another creature which he also kills while saying that this isn't the way it's supposed to be. He then transforms and drives away thinking to himself that someone else other than monsters and that everything can't just be dead when he crashes. He suddenly finds himself in a room with Ratchet and Wheeljack hovering above him telling him to get up. He's glad to see them and asks where everyone is and they say that they're at his funeral. He says that that can't be true because he's not dead when he suddenly sees the bot who he had arrested long ago at the racetrack half destroyed and the bot tells him that Prime isn't happy because he let the Stunticons get away. Ironhide says that he wasn't working for Prime at the time and then the bot tells him they're more dangerous now and he's lost his old job and no one recognizes him anymore. Ironhide then cries out that it can't be that no one recognizes him because he'd take a laser blast for any of his fellow bots and Prowl tells him that that's just stupid and it was a mistake and he ruined everything. Then Wheeljack appears and tells him that he also fixed everything. Ironhide is confused by this and then Wheeljack starts to get louder and louder and starts telling him that he must come now. Ironhide then wakes up and finds a bot standing in front of him telling him that he must come now and nothing else. He then transforms and follows the bot since there doesn't seem to be anything else to do. The bot just tells him to follow it and he just starts talking saying how he's glad that the bot isn't a monster and the place has changed a lot. He then tells the bot that he's just going to keep talking if it's alright with him because there's no one else there when they arrive at a part of Cybertron which is filled with lights and appears as though it may actually have living beings within.",

He thinks he's pinned down the problem: location, location, location. So, with the help of his fairy friend Ash (and an over-friendly farm cat), he's made his way into the spookiest spot he can find: a nearby old mansion. But when he faces what's inside, will he prove himself a tiny terror, or just terrified?</i> <i>  </i> ",

            "description": "<p><i>Nothing is sacred as Crossed returns! The biggest hit horror series of the year returns with an all-new six-issue series written by David (Stray Bullets) Lapham! Set right at the start of the Crossed outbreak, this epic tale of depravity promises to shock and disturb you with even more intensity than the first series! The Pratt family was torn apart by the sudden strike of the infected masses. The survivors think they have found a safe place to start over. A place the Crossed won't find them and can be well defended. But those are only the external threat as evil lurks in the hearts of some men and those terrors aren't as easy to see as a Crossed rash. Imagine, for a moment, the worst crimes against humanity. Picture the cruelest affronts to decency. Conjure your darkest nightmares... and then realize it could all be so much worse. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed.</i></p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The first and fifth covers are a homage and a parody of Grant Wood's <em>American Gothic</em>.</li></ul>",

From the New York Times Best-selling author, George R. R. Martin, comes a tale of vampire clans, death and debauchery, legendary blood masters, and even a few epic steamboat races on the muddy Mississippi. This is Martin's FEVRE DREAM, an antebellum story of power, loss, and the fever of bloodlust. Marsh and York's beautiful riverboat, the Fever Dream, has already proved herself faster than the smaller boats on the river. But now she's going to face off against The Southerner, and that race won't be the only confrontation on the river when Marsh goes head to head with his co-captain! And what is the dark and brooding Damon Julian planning? There's snarling and dissent from his brood on the Garoux plantation that can only end in blood... but whose? Each issue of this stunning full-color epic is illustrated by Rafa Lopez, an artist whose skilled line captures every moonlit drop of blood in delicious detail. Adapted by the Hugo-nominated author Daniel Abraham, this version of FEVRE DREAM stays faithful to Martin's original dark vision, while bringing the torture and joy of his vampires to almost-human life.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>From the sparking-mad mind of Warren Ellis, comes an electrical romance of a pirate utopia thwarted: CAPTAIN SWING &amp; THE ELECTRICAL PIRATES OF CINDERY ISLAND. London copper Charlie Gravel is on a boat ride to hell. He's about to discover what the people above his station really do to run the country, and to find out that, among the smugglers of the Blackwater and the dark creeks of Essex, there are such a thing as Electrical Pirates. This historical science-fiction piratical romance by Warren Ellis is illustrated in Raulo Caceres' stunning woodcut style, and presented in full color. It is the time of Captain Swing and his Electrical Pirates, and history will never be the same. CAPTAIN SWING #2 is available with a Regular or Wraparound cover by series artist Raulo Caceres, and a special retailer incentive Penny Dreadful cover designed to look like a classic novel of yore.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The end is here. Sacrifices have been made. The most dangerous and successful attempt at the extermination of mutants is upon us. Who will walk away?</i></p><p><i><b>Synopsis for X-Men Second Coming Chapter 14:</b></i></p><p><i>Chapter 1</i></p><p>Everyone watches in amazement as Hope's floating body glows in a fiery aura. As she lands back onto the ground, she stumbles and staggers towards Cable dismembered arm; clutching onto it as she calls his name and passes out.</p><p>In the infirmary, Hank is seen treating Piotr's wounds from the battle. A dazed Hope awakens to find herself in the infirmary and Hank comes over to examine her once he sees that she is conscious. Hope asks how long she has been out since then and Hank replies for \"around thirty hours\". Hank tells Hope that she seems to be fine and apologizes for his abruptness to leave her for he is needed to help treat the injuries of the other patients in the infirmary. Hank joins Doctor Nemesis in examining Warren's injured wings, while Doctor Rao checks up on Bobby, and Karma is seen being fitted for a new prosthetic leg. As Hope stands idle looking around at the injured, Erik tells Hope that it has been much less than a week. Hope seems puzzled by Erik, and he reminds her of what she had told him before and what she had done to Bastion. Hope says she does not exactly remember what has happened recently or what she had done and asks him if everyone around her thinks she's dangerous. Julian interrupts sarcastically saying who would think that she's dangerous as he waves his severed arms around. Erik quickly rebuffs Julian and tells him to run along and get back to rest. Erik tells Hope not to worry herself over what the others think as Hope lies down on the gurney next to Erik. She tells him that maybe it is alright to be thought of as dangerous.</p><p><i>Chapter 2</i></p><p>Hope has a flashback of Nathan telling her that she isn't gonna get rid of him that easy, and back in the present Hope and many of the other X-Men are attending the funeral service for him. As Scott tries to give a eulogy for his son, he is overwhelmed at the situation and is unable to do so. Hope sees this and steps up to speak for Nathan in his place; giving a tearful speech. After the funeral service Hope sits alone by herself near the coast. Loa, Bling and Prodigy watch Hope from afar and ponder if they should say anything to her, but Prodigy deduces that anything they have to say to her she already knows.</p><p>Scott pulls Rogue aside much to her dismay so they could have their talk. Scott tells Rogue that her actions and choices could have made Kurt and Nathan's deaths been in vain because she put Hope in the front lines and thus in danger. Rogue tells Scott that Hope wants to fight in the front lines alongside with the people that are putting their lives in danger for her and not to hide behind them. Scott tells her that her decision put their whole strategy plan in jeopardy, and is disappointed that she made that decision alone. He tells her that because Hope trusts and responds to her that she is needed on Utopia to help her cope with everything going on, but adds that she is reckless and a loose cannon and officially takes her off the combat roster.</p><p><i>Chapter 3</i></p><p>Logan is alone binge drinking as Ororo enters. He tells her to leave and she tells him she cannot and asks him what's wrong instead. He tells her that Kurt was the only X-Men that did not see him as an animal, but Kurt died seeing exactly that; an animal. Ororo asks him if Kurt was wrong, to which he simply responds no. Ororo mentions that she spoke to Scott about the secret formation of X-Force and that Scott told her that he accepts full responsibility for X-Force. Ororo looks at an old picture of herself, Scott, Jean, Kurt and Logan and reminisces of the past. She picks up the picture frame and tells Logan that she is taking it and that he may kill her if he does not like it because that is what he does now. Logan tries to explain his involvement in X-Force and rationalizes their actions and choices. Ororo saddened by his views says that she is sorry to hear that he felt that way because now this might be the last time that they are able to drink together.</p><p>Later, Logan approaches Laura and tells her that she's out. Confused, Laura replies that she does not understand what he means. Logan continues and tells her that it is over and that she is no longer in X-Force. Laura tells him that Cyclops ordered her to be in X-Force, but Logan replies that he should have never let Laura onto the team roster. He adds that both he and Cyclops used her just like how the Weapon X Facility would use her, and that it is time for her to act as her own person and make her own decisions. He asks her what does she want, still bewildered she replies that she doesn't understand. Logan continues to badger Laura on the subject and she simply replies that she does not know exactly what she wants. As Logan begin to turn and walk away from her, he tells her that it is a start and if she wants orders that she should give them to herself and he leaves her.</p><p>On Alcatraz, Scott tells Logan that numerous X-Men including Storm, Colossus, Iceman, Xavier, etc. have come to him about the underhanded formation of X-Force, and that Hank will not be returning. Scott continues on and tells Logan that X-Force will no longer be a part of the X-Men's future. Logan agrees more or less and tells Scott to get some rest because he looks exhausted and leaves. Logan walks into a darkened room and announces that this is now X-Force and that no one can ever know about them. Fantomex, Angel, Psylocke and Deadpool all stand beside Logan.</p><p><i>Chapter 4</i></p><p>Scott is alone preparing a letter to Kurt's sister to inform him of his death when Bobby comes in to inform him of Hanks departure. Hank and Namor are seen in the hangar(?) and they have a small chat. Hank wonders why Namor would take residence on the mutant isle of Utopia while Namor wonders what kind of man would turn his back on his own people. As Hank's aircraft takes off, Namor states that they are better off without him. After watching Hank leave, Scott leaves to find Emma and to check on Hope. Scott spots Emma at the bonfire and asks why she is in diamond form, and she responds that she is tired of feeling. Scott then asks Emma how is Hope doing to which she replies not so great considering her father is dead and everyone around her hates her. Scott then asks Emma if what they did was right and she says it does not matter, that what matters is tomorrow. Hope glances back at Emma and a phoenix like aura envelopes around Hope. A stunned Emma rushes to find Scott to tell him of what she saw, but when she finds him he tells her to quiet down. As five lights appear on cerebra, Scott tells Emma that they were right.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The battle for New York begins as battle lines are drawn and war forges strange allies. Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Spider-Man, Moon Knight and...Kingpin?! Plus, a dangerous new player enters the battle, one that could win the fight...or damn all of New York!</em></p><p>The second installment of Shadowland opens in Hell's Kitchen. The events of the previous issue are covered. A lone undercover cop remarks to himself about what Daredevil has done. He recalls the construction of Shadowland, the Hand ninjas patrolling the streets and in search of some of his fellow officers who are missing. He shatters the glass in his own taxi and the Hand ninjas are instantly on the scene.</p><p>Next, we head to a soup kitchen owned by Danny Rand. He and Luke Cage are discussing the actions of Daredevil and whether or not Bullseye deserved what he got. Cage calls it murder while Rand attempting to remain optimistic says you could say it was self defense. Cage disagrees saying Murdock's actions are only bringing fear to Hell's Kitchen and he breaks up a scuffle in the soup kitchen.</p><p>The Kingpin and Lady Bullseye enter the soup kitchen. Fisk says he wants to return Hell's Kitchen to legitimate authority and Luke &amp; Danny scoff at his \"noble\" intentions. Fisk reiterates Cage's statement about fear ruling the streets and says they're going to have to take down Daredevil.</p><p>The story moves to Daredevil's throne room in Shadowland. Black tarantula approaches him and says wallowing in guilt isn't necessary. Daredevil says he feels no guilt or anything. Black Tarantula asks him what he needs and Daredevil says they need reinforcements. They need to expand their area of control and Black Tarantula questions the entire martial law governing Hell's Kitchen. Daredevil says he expects him to follow his orders without question. He is to invite all costumed heroes to join the Hand or become their enemies.</p><p>Back to Midtown. Kingpin and Lady Bullseye are apparently taking part in a mystical ritual. There is a pentagram shaped object on the floor and the Kingpin has an ancient scroll in his hand. Lady Bullseye says she had to slay many hand ninjas to obtain it. Kingpin says that the ritual has been prepared and all that remains is the final incantation. This will summon the Zugaikotsu warrior. Lady Bullseye says he is one of the Hand's most ancient enemies and should be feared. She says he seeks to control him like a child's plaything. Fisk says all men must bend to his wield and the ancient warrior was a man once.</p><p>Fisk utters the incantation in Japanese and Lady Bullseye questions if anything happened or not. Fisk says he can hear it and its getting closer. He says she may wish to duck as something crashes through a nearby window. Fisk is shocked and Lady Bullseye says not to look at it's eyes. The demon asks, \"What the hell is this?\" Fisk says, \"Oh ancient one, hear me now. A great injustice has been done in the city. Voices cry out in darkness.\" The demon cuts him off and says \"You may cut the masterpiece theater talk fat man. Voices crying out for what?\" Fisk simply replies...\"What else? Vengeance.\"</p><p>Once again we go back to Shadowland. White Tiger with Hand ninjas confronts Luke cage, Iron Fist, Shang Chi, Misty Knight &amp; Colleen Wing. She says that Daredevil sees no one and Shadowland is off limits to civilians. Then we go back to Daredevil's throne room. Daredevil assumes they've reconsidered his offer. The group of heroes says they just wanted to talk. Murdock says there is nothing to discuss and the other heroes argue with him over his recent tactics. At this moment Spider Man enters the throne room from a nearby window.</p><p>Finally we go to the Shadowland dungeon. The cop from the first part of the issue is behind bars with some of his fellow officers. They discuss the rumors swirling regarding Shadowland. The officer regurgitates a lock pick and escapes his cell. He decides to check out the layout of the prison before freeing anyone else. As he looks around they hear a rumble. One of the officers says it sounds like a dinosaur. \"Worse\" says the cop. Ghost Rider has entered Shadowland. He easily dispatches some of the Hand ninjas with Hellfire. Laughing hysterically he races upward.</p><p>Finally, Daredevil is notified they've been breached. Daredevil blames it on Iron Fist, Luke Cage and friends. He says he knew they couldn't be trusted. He orders the Hand to take them down. This issue closes with Cage, Iron Fist, Shang Chi, Spider-Man, Colleen Wing and Misty Knight throwing down with DD, Black Tarantula, White Tiger and Hand ninjas....</p>",

One location possesses the technology and expertise required to teach these mysterious individuals their unique and deadly talents: the Ghost Academy. Struggling to forget her harrowing past, Nova, a powerful psionic soldier-in-training, has found strength in her fellow trainees: Tosh, a hard-line Dominion supporter; Kath, a mouthy vice-president's daughter; Delta, a bubbly newbie; and Lio, a scatter-brained technopath. Together, Nova and her teammates undergo brutal physical and psychological exercises as their unique telepathic and telekinetic powers are twisted to serve the Dominion. But while Nova grows stronger, her team begins to fall apart. Tosh's admiration for Nova turns into distracting attraction. A feud with a former teammate consumes Kath, and Lio disappears into the bowels of the Ghost Academy for some extremely terrifying \"medical treatment.\" Meanwhile, friends from Nova's past fall under zerg attack! Will the trainees regain their focus in time to step up as true heroes of the Koprulu Sector?</i></p>",

All this, and the secret manipulator behind the scenes twists his knife in Steve's back with an ending that will leave readers stunned!</i></p><p>Shot by a sniper, Jacob Erskine urges Steve Rogers to protect his wife because “if Smith’s done it”, “they’ll come after her now”. Erskine dies and Rogers escapes the hotel. Once on the ground, he sees a sniper’s nest, but he finds it was controlled remotely by computer. Rogers scours the Madripoor underworld for intel on who may have hired a hitman to kill Erskine. No one has info, and Rogers suspects it was an inside job.</p><p>Rogers asks Sharon Carter to gather info on Myron Smith, Erskine’s head of security. Rogers then recalls the woman who looks like Erskine’s wife, Anita. Lieutenant Cynthia Glass worked on the Super-Soldier experiment, ended up being a Nazi spy, but also died saving Rogers against orders from her superiors. Rogers tails Smith and Anita to Nextin Pharmaceuticals’ corporate retreat. Rogers confronts Anita while she walks on the beach and she seems to remember Rogers. Carter calls Rogers with info on Smith, who has no personal history at all prior to joining Nextin. Rogers figures out the puzzle – Anita Erskine and Myron Smith are machines controlled by the Machinesmith. Machinesmith then begins to deactivate the super-soldier serum in Rogers’ blood and Rogers begins to shrink.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The creative team of</i> <i>Jonathan Maberry and</i> <i>Goran Parlov take you on a journey into the darkest territory in this Marvel Knights limited series. A terrible plague has swept the Earth, turning everyone - human, hero, villain, god and monster - into sadistic cannibal predators. As Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Thing and other infected start a feeding frenzy, the world falls in a wave of insatiable violence. Now, five years later, one man hunts the wasteland that was New York City. One man stands against the hordes of monsters who hunt the night. He is the Punisher, the Last Gun on Earth. And he has an endless supply of ammunition.</i></p><h3>Synopsis</h3><p>New York was infected with a disease that limited peoples' higher brain functions which reduced everyone to cannibals. Everyone except for the Punisher. He was forced to hunt the infected and was on the trail of the Hulk. He shot the Hulk in the eye with an arrow made of a broken piece of Wolverine's claw. The Hulk collapsed and Punisher seized the opportunity to kill the incredible Hulk.</p><p>In the distance the Punisher could hear cries for help. Upon further investigation, he discovered two survivors in a church trapped in a pit. As Punisher lowered a rope to rescue a clergyman &amp; a young boy, Venom ambushed the Punisher. He managed to kill Venom and pull the two out of the pit before more infected within the church could stop him.</p><p>Along the way back to Punisher's hideout the preacher explained he had been trying to help those not infected but, everyday more and more people turn and become cannibals. He thanked God for answering his prayers and sending the Punisher to come rescue him, but Punisher did not share his belief in God and sees their timely rescue as a coincidence or luck. The pastor explained that he has not lost his faith in God despite the all that has happened. He saw irrevocable proof of hell all around him and conversely knows if Hell exists than Heaven must also exist.</p><p>At the Punisher's hideout Deadpool called out Punisher wanting to talk. The Punisher shot Deadpool several times before tying him up. Deadpool told him there were more survivors, and that his boss would like to talk with Punisher. The Punisher left Deadpool with a necklace made of hand grenades around his neck and went back inside the hideout to find Spider-Man (Deadpool's boss) holding the priest and the boy.</p>",

Each hero approaches the puzzle from a different angle, and now they must race to discover the truth - but The Hand has other ideas, and time is running out! Can this quartet of strange bedfellows put their differences aside and come together before death strikes again? Join writer Antony Johnston (DAREDEVIL) and artist Wellinton Alves (THUNDERBOLTS) for a trip down the mean streets of Shadowland!</i></p><p>Paladin, thinking he shot and injured Shroud at the conclusion of last issue, is fooled by the Shroud who was faking injury. After a short fight, they stop and begin to sort out their stories. Paladin had been hired by Mikey Fortunado (found dead last issue) to kill his brother, Bobby. After Mikey wound up dead, Paladin assumed that Bobby was responsible and went to rob him to recover his fee when he ambushed the Shroud, who had been observing Bobby’s apartment. The Shroud tells Paladin that the Hand was responsible for Mikey’s death, but Paladin is unconvinced that Daredevil would have bothered to have Mikey killed.</p><p>Misty Knight cons her way into the office of the Chief Medical Examiner and examines Mikey Fortunado’s body while another technician is in the morgue with her. Knight finds that Mikey had rohypnol is his blood and observes that his wounds were too sloppy to have been caused by the Hand. Later, the Hand show up in Misty’s office and tell her they did not kill Mikey Fortunado and tell Misty to stop her investigation. Misty calls Bobby Fortunado and tells him he may be in danger. As he talks to Misty, Bobby sees Hand ninjas in his apartment.</p><p>Silver Sable calls her employer to ask about her fee. Her employer states that the job was to bring back her target alive, which she did not do, and he then implies that Sable killed him intentionally, which would harm her reputation. She vows to find who killed her target.</p><p>At Bobby Fortunado’s apartment, Paladin arrives to find Bobby and his men dead. Misty arrives and thinks Paladin killed Bobby. He denies it as more of Bobby’s men show up. They assume Misty and Paladin killed Bobby and train their guns on them.</p>",

Who is the kid that can mop the floor with them both? And if that wasn't bad enough, the worst villains from Luke and Danny's past are crawling out of the woodwork en masse to take them on: Cockroach Hamilton! Comanche! Specs! Senor Muerte! Discuss! Stiletto! Why has this flash mob of colorful criminality suddenly swarmed against our heroes -- and what role does it play in the long-term schemes of The Hand?</i></p><p>AThe book opens with another flashback as Victor Alvarez argues with his father over his parent’s impending divorce. Just as Victor accuses his father of caring about the protest for the apartment building more than his family, the building blows up (due to Bullseye).</p><p>In present day, Victor’s mother comes to talk to him, but realizes he has snuck out. Picking up on the fight from last issue, the new Power Man continues to take on Luke Cage and Iron Fist. A nearby drug dealer recognizes Power Man as the one who took out his crew early last issue. He calls someone he refers to as “D.N.S.”, who summons the Rivals. The fight continues as Power Man absorbs the chi from Iron Fist’s signature punch, much to the surprise of Iron Fist. The Rivals arrive and take on a drained Power Man. Cage and Iron Fist join the fight and beat up several of the Rivals. They are briefly detained by Chemistro’s alchemy gun which allows Power Man to leave the scene. We learn that Power Man is the son of the former Rival member Shades. Cage and Iron Fist can’t pursue him any longer as they must get to Shadowland for Daredevil’s intervention ( <a data-ref-id=\"4000-227712\" href=\"/shadowland-/4000-227712/\">SL #2</a>). During the ensuing Shadowland melee, Daredevil removes the ban on killing, prompting the ninjas who were beaten by Power Man (last issue) to plan their revenge.</p><p>At home, Power Man/Victor reveals to his stepsister Sofia that he is Power Man. He confesses to her that he has no idea how he survived the apartment explosion and that he has intense dreams that seem like memories. He makes Sofia promise to keep his secret. His mother then barges in and Sofia tells her Victor was jumped by the Rivals and his mom believes her.</p><p>On Riker’s Island, a voice in a limo talks to a lawyer who tells her that half the Rivals will be released from jail and the other half will have to stay due to warrants. The voice turns out to be Deadly Nightshade (“D.N.S.”), who is in pursuit of Power Man for an item that “Specs” stole from her months ago.</p>",

From the award-winning master of comics, Alan Moore, comes a brand new tale of Lovecraftian horror that will leave you too afraid to close your eyes, but more afraid to open them! NEONOMICON, the sequel to THE COURTYARD Graphic Novel, is slithering its way onto shelves to take its place as a Great Old One of comics terror! Illustrated by Moore's favorite demented artist, Jacen Burrows, NEONOMICON pulls no punches as every full-colored page is covered in nightmares brought to gruesome life! In the wake of a gruesome homicide and an impossible vision in the courtyard, Agents Brears and Lamper are understandably rattled, but more determined than ever to find answers. Now, their case is taking them literally and literarily through Lovecraftian mythos, to Salem, Massachusetts as they try to unravel the secrets of sex, drugs, murder, and the ever-creeping darkness...</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>On a bitter winter day,</i> <i>Kinsey Locke</i> encounters a madwoman who just might be able to unlock the darkest secrets of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55977\" href=\"/keyhouse/4020-55977/\"><i>Keyhouse</i></a>, but forcing the truth out of her won't be easy, and besides... <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52416\" href=\"/lucas-caravaggio/4005-52416/\"><i>Dodge</i></a> has no intention of ever giving Erin Voss a chance to tell what she knows...</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>The issue starts with two men shoveling snow off the side walk. One is making racist comments about President Obama as a black woman pushes another black woman in a wheelchair. As <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52411\" href=\"/tyler-locke/4005-52411/\">Tyler</a>, Kinsey, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-59946\" href=\"/jordan-gates/4005-59946/\">Jordan</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52416\" href=\"/lucas-caravaggio/4005-52416/\">Zach</a> walk by, the woman in the wheelchair starts to scream the names Dodge and Rendell at them. The two women continue into a gated residence and the woman pushing reveals that the woman in the wheelchair is Erin Voss. Remembering the name, Kinsey implores Mrs. Voss for information about Keyhouse and her father. Mrs. Voss simply yells back \"No! White! White! WHITE!\" Kinsey wonders why Erin is scared until the man who was shoveling snow points out that the residence is McClellan Psychiatric Hospital. Kinsey wants to seek answers from Erin but Tyler simply wants life to be normal.</p><p>Kinsey is back at Keyhouse with Scott and Jamal, remembering Erin's name being on the wall in the drowning cave, while through the door <a data-ref-id=\"4005-52413\" href=\"/bode-locke/4005-52413/\">Bode</a> is eavesdropping. Kinsey is astounded that Erin acted that way just because she was white, citing that Erin was friends with her father. She wonders how to get in when Jamal mentions that it isn't difficult to get in and that his uncle used to work there until racism forced him to quit. Kinsey decides that she'll go Saturday. Scott points out that the problem isn't getting in, the problem is she's still white.</p><p>The two men who were shoveling snow are now in the bar when Zach, who has used the gender key to become a girl, approaches them. Zach asks them about McClellan and then tells them a story about how she bet someone Erin Voss was in there. As proof she asks them to take a picture of Erin and specifies that the picture must include the door to her room. The man answers that Zach can expect the pictures on Saturday.</p><p>Bode is standing before Kinsey with something held behind his back. Bode reveals that he can fix it so that Erin will talk to her, but only if Kinsey and Tyler start including him when making plans. Kinsey asks how he is going to help her talk to Erin when he pulls a mirror from behind his back. The mirror enables a person looking into it to take on the appearance of another ethnicity.</p><p>Kinsey and Bode, both now black, are sitting across from a black boy on a bus. Kinsey comments on how a woman won't sit down, even though there is an empty seat. Bode remarks that maybe she's getting off at the next stop, which she does. Kinsey wonders if it really mattered why she wouldn't sit, that \"Maybe it just sucks not knowing.\" The boy sitting across from them states that \"<b>Mostly</b> it just sucks not knowing.\"</p><p>Kinsey and Bode arrive at McClellan as the photo that Zach requested is being taken. One of the snow shoveling guys enters Erin's room to take more photos as the other guards the door. As the man shuts the door to Erin's room a disguised and knife-wielding Zach uses the Anywhere Key to enter. Zach kills the man in the room and Erin begins to scream, alerting the man outside. He enters, sees Zach and flees to the room across the hall, with Zach in pursuit. Kinsey enters Erin's room. Not noticing the body hidden behind her, she uses the Head Key to peer into Erin's mind, to find only white walls with Rendell written on one wall with a valentine's heart picture of him, and scrawled on the other wall is Dodge and the Omega Key. In the foreground of her mind is Kinsey opening Erin's head and a masked man holding two knives over a body on a bed. Kinsey realizes that Erin's thoughts quickly fade away and that what is in her mind is the present. She turns to see the body as a nurse comes and she runs from the room.</p><p>Back at Keyhouse, as the television shows news of racial prejudice, Kinsey relates to Tyler how Bode and she could not hail a cab until they had become white again. Tyler says that at least the authorities are not looking for Kinsey, to which Kinsey doesn't know how to feel. The final segment on the news is the search for \"an African-American, in her teens or early twenties.\"</p>",

Just as young Lieutenant  Thomas Brightwater meets Doe in a remote and secret outpost at the edge  of desert and gets a brief glimpse of his dark backstory, the terrifying  being breaks free and havoc is unleashed. Meanwhile, armed with what  they do know as well as a regional conflict in the Middle East quickly  spinning out of control, higher ups in Washington mobilize a twisted  plan to ensnare the whole region in a final and decisive battle royal.  Or so they think. Because they could have never predicted how the  biggest menace of all is of their own ilk and with the potential to  terrorize their forces in a way no terrorist ever could. For Lieutenant  Brightwater, the race is on to once more gain control over Doe,  understand his unfathomable origins, and possibly get him back on the  cause.

Yet it's all fun and games until the slimy mayor enters the picture - and then the girls might have found a common enemy big enough for them to forget their feud and work together.</i></p>",

The most popular femme fatale in comics returns with a vicious new tale that delivers for both new and old readers! Lady Death's quest to recover her stolen powers takes her to the shifting and treacherous sands of the Middle East, where monstrous, stinging death awaits her in the Temple of Akrab! Guided by inner visions, Illadra has made her way to the desert, where any number of a dozen fates worse than death can befall the voluptuous thief if she makes one misstep. But even if she makes it across the burning expanse to her goal, will she survive against the guardians of the first shard of her power, creatures warped and corrupted by the very evil which emanates from the piece of Lady Death's lost soul which she hopes to ensnare? Co-written by Mike (Gravel, Wolfskin) Wolfer and original creator Brian Pulido, this series promises to be the most powerful Lady Death tale ever! Amazing new talent Marcelo Mueller provides the luscious art and Digikore brings the dramatic colors wrapped in a stunning new cover by Garrie (Supergod) Gastonny!

And how will the rest of the Future Foundation react to the revelation of their newest member?</i></p><p>Valeria Richards, Reed Richards and Nathaniel Richards are presenting the newest member of the Future Foundation, Victor Doom, to the rest of the family. Ben Grimm thinks its a trap and tries to attack Doom. Doom goads him by insisting Ben stood by while Johnny Storm died. The Thing is about to pound Doom but is stopped by Susan Richard. Ben storms off with Dragon Man and Susan Richard soon follows after telling Reed it's a bad idea to keep Doom in their home.</p><p>Reed takes Doom into the Room, a high tech classroom for the Future Foundation kids. He poses the problem that Victor is now dumber then his former self. After some brief discussion the theory is that Victor's brain has been tampered with and certain memories and knowledge have be removed. The group comes to the decision that to fix Victor's brain they need a back-up of Doom's brain, and one exists in Latveria in the head of Kristoff.</p><p>Meanwhile at Muk's Bar Ben Grimm, Sue Richards and the Dragon Man share a few beers and decided that maybe the less smart members of the Future Foundation need to take some time and figure out where they belong in the foundation.</p><p>Later in Latveria, Reed, Nathaniel, Valeria, Spider-man and Doom arrive to warm welcome from Kristoff who agrees to give Doom back his memories and arcane knowledge. While the machine is transferring knowledge, Reed is tempted to push a Purge button instead of the transfer button but decides against it.</p><p>After a large explosion Doom rises and shows that his is now as smart as he once was and now possess arcane powers once more. He then informs Kristoff to remain leader of Latveria while he keeps his promise to Valeria Richards, to defeat Reed Richards.</p>",

And it's about to get worse, as he must go up against one of the Serpent's elite vanguard alone!</em></p><p>Jimmy Woo’s journey to uncover an international conspiracy takes him and the Agents of Atlas to Europe and a descent into universal intrigue where if the voyage doesn’t kill them, what they find there will! More explosive and heart-wrenching tales from across the globe as the entire Marvel Universe quakes from Fear Itself!</p><p>*Speedball in \"Scapegoat\", part 2 of 7 by Gage &amp; Mayhew</p><p>-Speedball manages to escape from the angry Stamford mob, surprisingly with the assistance of Miriam Sharpe, the founder of the organization that's rallying against him and blames him for the death of her son. Supervillains escaped from the raft (See Fear Itself #2) are on the rampage through Stamford and Sharpe is reluctant to let Speedball out of her sight to help, considering what happened last time he tried to fight villains in her town, but she eventually agrees that with the damages and injuries being caused by Whirlwind, Living Laser and others, Speedball's involvement couldn't possibly make things worse. Unfortunately, Speedball isn't that much help as he's taken down fairly easily by Living Laser. While the villains make their escape, there is an amusing reference to Icemaster's embarrassing origins as a villain from one of the infamous \"Hostess Fruit Pies\" ads of the 70's.</p><p>The same angry mob from before catches up with the unconscious Speedball and figures out a way they can hurt him. Without hitting him in any way that would trigger his kinetic powers, the mob's leader pulls a plastic bag over his head and proceeds to attempt to suffocate him. Things are looking grim for our hero, until Miriam Sharpe shows up to save the day, wielding a shotgun.</p><p>*Jimmy Woo [and the Agents of Atlas] in \"The Age of Anxiety\" part 2 of 4, by Milligan &amp; Bonetti</p><p>-The Atlas team explores the Thule society's castle while Nazi robots rampage through the place. The team splits up; Jimmy going with M-11 and the rest separate. M-11 helps Jimmy to find a secret lab filled with the remains of Atlanteans who were tortured for the Thule Society's mystic rites during World War II, the same rites that led into what's going on right now. Jimmy's first concern is to keep Namora from discovering the desecrated remains of her kin, but has no time to figure out a way to do this as the rest of the team quickly arrives on the scene.</p><p>*A Moment With...

Harold Lorre, a wretch of a man, has duped a group of fellow survivors into helping him. They have fallen for all his lies, his charades, and his deceipts. Yet the mission he leads them on seems almost sweet. Join us as Lapham and artist Raulo (Capt Swing) Caceres descend into a story about the worst aspects of human behavior, a tale of unspeakable evils, violent assaults on both mind and body, and of longing for death and the sweet release it will bring. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed. Crossed: Psychopath #2 is available with a Regular cover by Jacen Burrows, a Wraparound cover by series artist Raulo Caceres, a Torture cover by Matt Martin, and a special rare Red Crossed retailer incentive.</i></p>",

In just a few short years, young police chief Cash McCogan has watched his native city of Las Vegas go from cow-town to wild, glittering boomtown. And when the bodies of prominent businessmen start showing up drained of blood, Chief McCogan finds himself facing a threat much darker and deadlier than anything he could have imagined . . . and the only sure bet in town is that Skinner and Pearl are right in the thick of it.</i></p><h2>Back Blurb</h2><p><i>VIVA VAMPIRES!</i></p><p><i>Las Vegas, Nevada, 1936. Its days of glitz and glamour are still far off in the future. But with gambling, whoring, and violent crime its chief-economic activities, this rough and tumble town is already earning its \"Sin City\" moniker. And Cash McCogan, Vegas' tough-as-nails police chief, is out to clean it up -- even if it means taking on the filthy rich consortium that's building the astonishing Hoover Dam just miles away.</i></p><p><i>There's just one problem: The Colorado River ins't the only thing near Vegas that's been \"damned\".</i></p><p><i>First and deadliest of his breed, American vampire Skinner Sweet has set up shop in Sin City.

An all-out war is about to break out between some of the oldest and deadliest vamps in the world -- along with a shadowy society dedicated to taking them all down for good.</i></p><p><i>When the dust settles, who will be left alive (or undead) to stake their claim?</i></p>",

Barry Allen is on a mission to find out or die trying – and that may be what's happening as he tries to make lightning strike twice! Meanwhile, around the submerged Paris, the pirate Deathstroke confronts Emperor Aquaman!</i></p><p><i>Summary:</i></p><p><em>Flashpoint #2</em> starts on a ship in the middle of the ocean, Slade Wilson is searching for treasures out in the sea. Slade's ship almost goes too far inland on the shores of the ruins of Paris. Slade's ship is then boarded by Aquaman so they can kill everyone on the ship.</p><p>In Gotham City, Barry is in shock realizing that this Batman is Thomas Wayne. Batman then injures Barry's arm. Batman interrogates Barry asking him who is he and who is he working with. Barry declares he is the Flash, the fastest man alive, Batman then quips he wasn't fast enough to avoid his attacks. Barry insists that he just doesn't have his powers and no one remembers and that he needs Batman's help. Batman tells him he came to the wrong place. Then a surge of memories of this world starts to flash in Barry's head. Then his ring falls on the floor, Barry then uses it to prove to Batman who he is,and when the suit pops out Barry realizes that it's the Reverse Flash's costume who is probably moving so fast around that he becomes invisible to them. Barry explains his relationship with Eobard who killed his mother and had Barry's father convicted for it. Barry then explains to Thomas that in his reality Bruce survived the mugging and became Batman. Thomas asks him if Barry had his powers could he revert it to the other way, but first he needs his speed back before he forgets everything he ever knew.</p><p>In London or known now as New Themyscira, a group of Amazonians ambush a man with blond hair. Wonder Woman uses her lasso of truth and learns this man is Steve Trevor, a colonel in the the U.S. Special Forces, and his assignment is to find Lois Lane, who is in New Themyscira gathering intel on the Amazons for Cyborg.</p><p>In Gotham, Barry Allen and Thomas Wayne are gathering the materials needed to recreate the scenario needed so Barry Allen can become the Flash once again. As Lightning hits the electric chair Barry Allen becomes doused in the chemicals and is instead burned severely.</p>",

The one name that still speaks volumes of how absolute power can corrupt - Caligula. After his assassination attempt goes horribly and horrifyingly wrong young Junius finds himself taken in by Caligula, who renames him Felix, meaning 'lucky one', and becomes the Emperor's pet, confidant, whipping boy, lover, apprentice, and biographer. Caligula lavishes money and women on Felix one minute than beats him the next. Felix must play along if he's to find out the secret behind Caligula's mysterious supernatural power over life and death. Virgin blood ceremonies, gladiator fights rigged for added brutality, and dinner parties where guests are randomly slaughtered, is there any limit to Caligula's depravity? Can Felix keep his focus and sanity in the face of so much misery and horror? A modern master of horror, Lapham digs deep into the world of Rome 37 AD and offers a unique epic of sin. Joined by new talent German Nobile who promises to serve up fully-painted pages dripping with blood, this all-new, full-color series will be six issues of evil that will make any Crossed fan smile with glee. For in the age of Caligula, all roads lead to Hell.</i></p>",

But with the reveal of the fourth family of Gotham City and an old case from the early days of the city, is Batman playing right into the villain's hands?</i></p><p>Batman Gates of Gotham begins with Journey entries from an Nicholas Anders. He talks about how Gotham began, and how in 1840 Judge Solomon Wayne commission Cyrus Pinkney to construct buildings in Gotham. Later in 1860, Nicholas Anders moves to Gotham with his father and stepbrother. Nicholas Anders would talk about how him and his brother, Bradley would go to the tall buildings hoping to go to the clouds. They dreamed skyscrapers that would pierced the sky. They would become so obsessed with this dream that they become draftsmen for Architecture. Nicholas was an \"idea\" man while Bradley was the technician.</p><p>One day in 1871, a man named Alan Wayne came to the two brothers in search to expand his family business. Nicholas found this to be beneficial since this was what they wanted. Alan Wayne shared his dream, which was to find a way to take Gotham to the future. The first project they worked on was The New Trigate bridge-a new suspension bridge. During construction, Bradley and the unknown character approached Alan Wayne with other drawings for \"their\" Gotham. Then Alan Wayne brings the two brothers to a meeting with other influential families of Gotham, Theodore Cobblepot and Edward Elliot.</p><p>In Present day, Commissioner Gordon, Red Robin are investigating Tommy Elliot's disappearance. They go through the footage and see Tommy is kidnapped by a man in a steam punk outfit. They all decide to evacuate the Wayne and Cobblepot owned buildings. Then Tommy is with his steampunk kidnapper, and he says he respects what the man is doing. Then he makes a request that this man not attack the Waynes because if he does, Tommy will kill them. Later Damian and Cassandra Cain are on patrol. While they protect the Cobblepot building, Dick is searching the Elliot mansion. Dick thinks about how he thinks he knows Gotham but he realizes he knows so little. All of sudden Bombs are found in the Iceberg Lounge and Wayne Tower. In the Iceberg Lounge, Damian and Cassandra Cain try to dismantle the bomb. At Wayne Tower Batman finds the Bomb tied to Tommy Elliot. Since both bombs had accelerated dead man's switches Batman had to save Tommy Elliot over saving Wayne Tower. Cassandra had to pull out Damian because he was too stubborn to leave. Tommy laughs at dick telling him how can he hope to protect Gotham's future when you're so naive of its past. Then he reveals the Gates aren't what but who.</p>",

Yet his priorities change when he meets Hal Jordan and realizes how valuable and worth saving Earth is. As he forms an allegiance with Cyborg to save the doomed planet, Abin Sur is secretly visited by Sinestro. How will his old friend’s reveal of the prophecy called “Flashpoint” affect Abin Sur’s mission to protect Earth? And what does it mean for their relationship?</i></p><p>Abin and his spacecraft have crashed on Earth, but he has apparently not received any unrecoverable injuries. When the human Hal Jordan approaches, Abin requests his help in saving Earth. However, Cyborg appears on the scene and declares that the ship is now property of the United States. Once Abin has healed, he explains the situation to Cyborg, as well as his intention to save the Earth.</p><p>Later, at the White House, the President presents Abin Sur to the world as a rescuer of hundreds of European refugees. As Abin scans for survivors in Europe, he finds only one, Sinestro, who tells Abin about the Flashpoint prophecy. When Abin doesn't believe him, Sinestro declares that as long as Abin is alive, his plans cannot work. As they fight, Sinestro cuts off Abin's hand, and his ring with it.</p>",

Leonid makes his choice between his two fathers, Michelangelo and Tesla kick their plan into high gear and Howard Stark lays the foundation for the organization you know as S.H.I.E.L.D.</i></p><p>1503: Florence. Leonardo Da Vinci straps himself into a machine while the finishing touches are placed on the first ever Life Model Decoy in his likeness (and that will later show up in Secret Warriors). His intent is that the LMD will live out his life as if it were him, while he leaves for the future.</p><p>1960: The Immortal City. Leonid is shocked to see his father, Nikola Tesla, again. Stark and Richards are just as surprised by the devastation of the battle going on in the city. Spotting an opening, Newton leaps to stab Leonardo but Stark stops him by dismantling his weapon mid-flight. Newton is furious that those who follow Da Vinci have abandoned what Shield believe in. Michelangelo appears and tells everyone that the supply of the Infinity Formula is dwindling and Newton’s promise of eternal life for his followers is a lie. Newton is still insistent that the end of the world is unavoidable, but Tesla says that he, Stark and Richards have seen the future, so it isn’t true. The Shield council is called to judge Da Vinci and Newton. Tesla and Stark charge up a machine that projects the thoughts of the two accused men. Da Vinci is revealed to be full of self doubt and mistrust. Newton reveals that he killed Galileo and many others in his quest to ‘end man.’ Leonid sides with Da Vinci, but before anything can happen, Newton puts on Da Vinci’s teleportation/winged suit and disappears into the future. Michelangelo already knew this would happen and says they must travel after him ‘to the very end.’</p><p>Later, Stark builds a machine to leave a message behind, thinking he won’t come back.</p><p>In the Immortal City, Nostradamus frantically searches for some more Infinity Formula. As he does so, the Celestial discovers Newton’s math equations. The knowledge drives it crazy and it expands to a huge size, busting out of the building and into the city.</p>",

            "description": "<br/><p>The end of the previous issue saw Diane Coverdale’s house being attacked and Acteia about to confront Iris, but as this issue begins with Acteia awakening in what is essentially a hospital bed, I think we all know who won that battle.</p><p>This is the first part in the Hit List Agenda storyline that has dropped the standard of the rest of the issues. Acteia has been taken from Diane, but there is no mention of what happened to Diane after this, which is strange. We find out who Iris is working for (Duncan Villone, who seems to want some form of world domination, but who doesn’t) but it isn’t clear why or how this situation came about. It was all very uneventful and uninspiring.</p><p>The art is also a little inconsistent, particularly on Acteia’s face, which switches between round and angular, attractive and not. The brief fight scene at the end of the issue is cool and has some interesting layouts, but as it is pointless from a storytelling point of view, it doesn’t have the same impact as previous conflicts.</p><p>As Iris kidnapped Acteia for Duncan Villone, it seems like he might be trying to put together some sort of Executive Assistant army (dependent on how many he can control) and that could be interesting. But event series such as this can’t afford to drop the pace or the level interest and it is a shame that this has happened. However, I have already read the next issue of this cross over series (Orchid #2, which will be reviewed very soon) and things certainly do hot up again.</p>",

As a result of Gabriel's death, Epoch, the tournament that determines the leader of the Supernatural Council has been enacted for the first time in millennia. Now a mere human must safely navigate the politics and battles between angels, demons, werewolves, vampires and the other Supernatural races.</i></p><p>Jonah discovers about the secret council of supernatural creatures. The council is composed of eight supernatural orders, the Angel Order, the Demon Order, the Troll Order, the Gorgon Order, the Banshee Order, the Vampire Order, the Werewolf Order and the Warlock Order. Jonah also discovers that Mya Tokage is the leader of the Gorgon Order. At the meeting, Tobias Atrox, the leader of the Angel Order convinces the council to let Gabriel and Jonah investigate Michael's murder.</p><p>Later, Gabriel reveals to Jonah that millenia ago, as the number of humans grew exponentially, the supernaturals, although stronger began to fear for their survival. As mankind drove them to the brink of extinction, the supernaturals united in fear and eight supernatural races formed the council for mutual survival. To determine the leader of the council a tournament called Epoch is held. The winner of the tournament gets to appoint the leader of the council. Michael was the winner of the last Epoch and he appointed himself. Gabriel, an archangel himself, was being groomed as Michael's successor, however he falls in love with a mortal woman (Jonah's mother) and cuts off his own wings.</p><p>Meanwhile in preparation for the next Epoch, Tobias persuades his wife Aliyah to train Jonah as he is the last one with Archangel blood. To which Aliyah reluctantly agrees. Following the murder investigation Jonah and Gabriel visits a nightclub owned by Cyrus, the leader of the Vampire order. After a brief confrontation with the warlock Griffin Cyrus tells Jonah to \"follow the blood\".</p>",

The creature's roots run deeper than he knows, and the Parliament of Trees intends to make him understand the responsibility he wants so desperately to avoid! With this issue, the mythology of the Swamp Thing branches out in ways you never saw coming – don't miss it!</i></p><p> </p><p>We start off with a flashback, into the past of Calbraith A. H. Rodgers. He is flying a plane in WWII when he is shot down and crashes into a swamp. His body is taken over by the swamp and he becomes that generations Swamp Thing. He tells Alec that he has been sent by the Parliament of Trees to deliver a message. The Green wants him back to become the new Swamp Thing. Alec is still reluctant and so Rodgers connects with his mind to show him of the impending doom.</p><p>He shows him a creature known as Sethe, a force of death and rot that is gathering an army to destroy the world. Alec states that he does not want to become the Swamp Thing again, and Rodgers tells him that he never was. The Parliament could not save his body to attach to the Swamp Thing so they attempted to recreate his consciousness. Having finished, Rodgers begins to leave and just as he does he warns Alec; he should beware of a girl with white hair.</p><p>He goes back to his room when he sees the desk clerk and says hi. Back in his room Alec begins to dress and pack when the desk lady (who is now being controlled by Sethe) comes into the room and attacks him with an axe. He dodges the strike and runs outside only to be met with a group of Sethe followers. Suddenly a girl on a motorcycle, packing a shotgun helps him and they ride away. They stop off and when they do the girl takes off her helmet and introduces herself as Abigail Arcane all whilst pointing a gun at his head.</p>",

An unprecedented scientific disaster has created Hell on Earth, and Pandora finds that in one fell swoop, her unrealistic dream of a quick victory over Hellina has been dashed. Possessed by the Hell-spawned demon from another dimension, Pandora’s hesitant ally, Widow, is now in the clutches of Hellina, but the intentions of the dark intruders into our reality remains a mystery. The only hope in reversing the possession and saving both Widow and the innocent Sandra who has been transformed into Hellina lies in the hands of the Louisiana swamp witch, Anathema. But before Pandora can enlist the aid of her one-time friend, she’ll have to face a horror lurking under the fetid, bayou waters… This epic saga is written by Mike (Lady Death) Wolfer and featured the art of Pow (Justice League) Rodrix wrapped in a stunning new cover by Matt Martin! Available with a Regular or Gore cover by Matt Martin, as well as a Wraparound and a special Art Nouveau Retailer Order Incentive by painter Michael Dipascale!</i></p>",

Batman will need all his intellect, cunning and physical prowess to take on The Man of Steel.</i></p><p>At the Central City crime lab, Barry Allen draws close to solving the case of a husband and father murdered in the parking lot of his office. However, Director Singh has other orders for him. At the directive of the Chief of Police, all police resources have been allocated to discovering the true identity of the Flash, a costumed vigilante with superhuman speed.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Metropolis, Batman has emptied his utility belt fighting Superman and there is still no stopping the Kryptonian. Superman believes that Batman and Green Lantern are somehow tied to the alien invaders, who carried a box identical to the one Batman brought from Gotham. Green Lantern rejoins the fight, but he knows they’ll need backup.</p><p>Green Lantern has previously joined forces with the Flash, most recently to save Central City from a talking gorilla. He knows that the Flash and Barry Allen are one and the same, and the Flash knows that he is Hal Jordan. Green Lantern calls upon the Flash now, knowing they can’t defend themselves from Superman without him.</p><p>In an instant, the Flash runs from Central City to Metropolis. He’s the fastest man alive, faster even than Superman. Still, Superman’s speed is enough to land a blow on him, much to Flash’s surprise.</p><p>Even though Superman bests him, the Flash has still distracted him long enough for Batman to reason with the Kryptonian. The Flash does his best to clean up the collateral damage, but Metropolis police soon arrive, driving the four vigilantes into the sewers.</p><p>While the four seek safe harbor to study the box from Gotham, its twin from Metropolis arrives in a S.T.A.R. Labs facility in Detroit. Though they’ve made little progress, they discover that the box is broadcasting some kind of signal. Similar signals are being broadcast from New England, the District of Columbia, Central City, Coast City; all areas of meta-human activity.</p><p>As a leading scientist in the study of the meta-human presence, Dr. Silas Stone heads off the research. He is interrupted by a visit from his son, Vic, who is upset that his father missed yet another game. Stone argues that his work is about to make his son’s abilities obsolete, and Vic is crushed.</p><p>Just then, the boxes activate. Simultaneously, in Metropolis and in Detroit, their pinging increases in speed. They begin to glow, generating massive amounts of energy. With a reality-warping BOOM! each tears open an inter-dimensional portal, through which pour hordes of monstrous alien soldiers.</p><p>In Detroit, Vic Stone gets caught in the portal’s energy, and his body quickly burns away before his father’s eyes...</p>",

Hawkman and Morphicius resume their fight, but Morphicius holds the advantage, saying that he can master the Nth Metal faster than Hawkman can. Hawkman, refusing to surrender, dissipates his armor and tells Morphicius that he is ready to fight and he has nothing to lose. Morphicius replies that Hawkman has indeed something to lose, just not right now, and flies away.</p><p>At the Non-Lethal Alternative Studies headquarters, two agents have come to meet Dr. Hogarth Kane, a top scientist at N.L.A.S., telling him that the Under-secretary of Military Preparedness has cut down N.L.A.S.'s budget due to money constraints. The agents demand to see Kane's progress, and he agrees, on the condition that his methods are not put on official record. The agents agrees, and Kane shows them their tests on simians. The ultimate objective is to expose soldiers to neuro-interrupters to improve their combat effectiveness. However, the simians have died during the experiments.</p><p>Then, Askana, Kane's assistant, calls him for an emergency and Kane excuses himself. Kane recieves a phonecall from an unnamed person. As soon as he hangs up, Askana asks Kane if they have custody of the subject. Kane replies that the subject is still on the loose, but he has his best hunter on its trail.</p><p>Carter wakes up at the hospital, with Emma at his side. Professor Ziegler and Terrance come into Carter's room, saying that the police have notified the families of Morphicius's victims. Carter asks Professor Ziegler what does he think about Morphicius and Ziegler replies that there is no way the creature's blood cells could thrive in freezing temperatures. He believes that the cells heated themselves up in a form of adaptation. Ziegler gives Carter a photo depicting the symbols form the craft that carried Morphicius. Carter offers to decipher them and Emma agrees.</p><p>Suddenly, a nurse comes into the room and tells Carter that the police wants to talk to him, and Carter agrees. But as soon as everyone leaves, Carter jumps off the window and manifests his armor, flying away.</p><p>In Manhattan, Morphicius is losing control of the Nth metal and falls to a secluded alley. There, he finds a mysterious man who identifies himself as Waker, the last Vexaphon. Although Morphicius attacks him, Waker tells him that he has been sent to save his life.</p><p>In Brooklyn, Hawkman returns to his apartment and dissipates his armor. Carter believes that after using the Nth metal after so many years, the Nth metal might have gotten into his bloodstream. As he enters the building, he finds some people taking his taking his furniture. Mr. Gomez, the man in charge of the building, tells Carter that he is being evicted, saying that Carter had 30 days's notice. Carter replies that he can pay Mr. Gomez, he just needs to go to the bank, but Mr. Gomez doesn't believe it, as Carter is behind three months, plus a couple more thousands in damages. Then, Carter gives Mr. Gomez a box full of money, and Mr. Gomez tells the moving people to put Carter's furniture back into his apartment.</p><p>Later, Carter begins deciphering the symbols, and discovers that the symbols are describing a warning. Apparently, Morphicius was being transported to an intergalactic prison to be executed. Suddenly, Emma appears on his doorstep, having brought some food.</p><p>As she enters Carter's apartment, Emma tells him that he is not in any real trouble, except for leaving the hospital without a proper discharge, but the police wants him to call them as soon as he can. Then, Emma asks him how could he charge against the alien while everybody else ran away. Carter asks her if she wants him to feel guilty for getting all those men killed. Emma feels insulted, saying that she had to take care of her father after his recent Alzheimer's diagnosis. Then, Carter abruptly leaves Emma.</p><p>At the N.L.A.S. headquarters, scientists have been examinating the weakened Morphicius. Apparently, Morphicius's body is rejecting his latest acquisition. Kane says that maybe they should let Morphicius die, believing they could get better data from an autopsy, but Waker won't let him. Suddenly, Askana kills him, revealing a Xenusian claw. Afterwards, Kane states that they will proceed with their mission: the Extinction Virus.</p><p>To be continued...</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Garth Ennis continues the epic story begun in his film, Stitched! Deep behind enemy lines in war-torn Afghanistan, the surviving crew members of a downed American Blackhawk helicopter faced certain death until the arrival of the three British SAS soldiers who the chopper crew was to extract from unfriendly territory. Death could find them in a dozen different ways, but it's not enemy fire, dehydration or exposure to the elements which the refuge-seeking group fears most- It's the \"Stitches,\" the fearsome, corpse-like dead men who hunt the desert wastes, ripping apart both Taliban fighters and coalition forces alike. With precious little water and limited ammo, the six embark on a flight for survival across a desert littered with the corpses of the mutilated and enforced by the supernaturally-animated \"Stitches.\" This new on-going series is certain to appeal to Ennis' legions of fans as it pushes the envelope of horror beyond the boundaries of sanity and into fresh nightmares. Stitched #2 is available with a Regular cover, Wraparound cover, and Gore cover by series artist Mike Wolfer, and a special Stitched Movie Photo cover retailer incentive cover.</i></p>",

Where does a complete novice start? And with a co-worker who is madly obsessed with Italian wines, how will he ever find the proper perspective and direction needed to take on someone like the prince of wine criticism, Issei Tohmine?</i></p><p><i>To prepare himself Shizuku volunteers to participate in a unique wine tasting by one of Japan's up-and-coming wine traders and producers Saoin Wines. The same group that is funding Shizuku's rival Tohmine have established an event that showcases 100 unique wines together in a formal setting. This is a high-stakes wine event, where the most enjoyed wines will certainly be bought up at top dollar by the finest food and wine establishments of Asia. As a member of Taiyo Beers new Wine Sales Division, Shizuku must select the best wine at this event. And even if the labels are not the best known, he will have to trust his senses and his own judgement of taste to pick the one true wine worth sales on the market today.</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 19: Karma and Cuisine</li><li>Chapter 20: The Wine or the Cuisine</li><li>Chapter 21: Father and Daughter</li><li>Chapter 22: Passionate Gods Awaken</li><li>Chapter 23: Chablis and Oysters</li><li>Chapter 24: And the True Preparations Begin</li><li>Chapter 25: Quietly a New Round Opens</li><li>Chapter 26: Happening Across a Wonderful Gift</li><li>Chapter 27: The Necessity of French Wine</li><li>Chapter 28: Downtown Wine Brothers Blues</li><li>Chapter 29: Drink Daddy's Wine!</li><li>Chapter 30: Manly Tears!

In this second book, our heroes continue their quest by wandering through the primeval gloom of Fireburg Forest in search of the prophet and poet Bromedes, who can unlock the mysteries of Atlantis for them.</i></p><p><i>Along the way, they encounter giant spiders, river trolls, and copious amounts of killer weed. Joe Daly's delightfully unique stoner/philosopher dialogue and distinctive character designs, coupled with hilarious over-the-top Role Playing Game action (complete with periodic updates for each character's status in ten criteria, including 'dexterity,' 'intelligence,' and 'money'), propel Daly's story into heretofore unachieved action-comedy heights.</i></p>",

Argentina decides to seize the Falkland Islands, occupied by the United Kingdom since the beginning of the 19th century. On April 2, an island landing of Argentine forces succeeds, taking the government of Margaret Thatcher by surprise. Argentina asserts its sovereignty over the Islands. While hoping for a diplomatic solution, No. 10 Downing Street prepares a large-scale operation to regain control of the Falkland Islands. Along with the use of traditional combat techniques, these operations also provide an extraordinary test of modern electronic weaponry.</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>For 35 years, Hal Foster created epic adventure and romantic fantasy in his legendary Sunday strip, <b>Prince Valiant</b>. Realistic in its visual execution and noble in its subject, depicting a time in which the fabled warriors of history and legends fought together for the greater good, it remains one of the great masterpieces of the medium.</i></p><p><i>In this second volume, Prince Valiant helps his father reclaim his throne in the kingdom of Thule, fights alongside King Arthur, and is made a knight of the Round Table in recompense for his bravery and wit. Bored by the peace he helped to create, Val decides to independently pull together the forces to battle the Huns’ descent on Southern Europe. When Val’s army breaches the Huns’ stronghold, however, he discovers that corruption reigns still further west in Rome. Thus Val sets off with Sir Gawain and Tristam of Arthurian legend fame, and the familial kinship of the trio sees them through chivalrous escapades, false imprisonment and daring escapes. By the end of this volume, they go their separate ways, and Val boards a ship to Sicily—yet a storm approaches, throwing him off-course, as adventure follows him everywhere.</i></p><p><i>Fantagraphics is proud to present these strips, which, thanks to the use of original proof sheets and advances in printing technology, are even brighter and crisper than when they were originally published 70 years ago. Foster’s work, painterly and sweeping, is finally treated to the grand depiction it deserves. These illustrative, time-honored comic strips will enthrall old readers and just as easily awe new ones.</i></p>",

Ranking among the web’s smartest and crudest cartoons, like Achewood, Penny Arcade, and The Perry Bible Fellowship, Explosm.net’s massively popular webcomic would make the cast of South Park blush. Readers, get ready for a laugh-out-loud voyage to the realm of the absurd.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>BATTLEFIELDS: HAPPY VALLEY TPB by Garth Ennis and PJ Holden</em></p><p><em>England, January 1942: young Australian Ken Harding arrives at his first operational squadron, keen to play his part in the aerial attack on Germany as the commander of a bomber crew. Losses have been high and life expectancy is low, but Ken remains undaunted- until he meets his crew, a foulmouthed, battle-hardened bunch with no time for new boys who can't stand the pace. Together, they must take the war to the enemy over the most heavily-defended region of the Third Reich- the industrial heartland of the Ruhr, known to the men who face the flak and nightfighters as Happy Valley.</em></p><p><em>BATTLEFIELDS FIRELFY &amp; HIS MAJESTY By Garth Ennis and Carlos Ezquerra</em></p><p><em>The Tankies' Sergeant Stiles returns, recently promoted and angrier than ever! He's got a new crew and a new tank - a Sherman Firefly with a high-velocity gun capable of taking out even the fearsome German Tiger. Too bad the enemy have a new tank of their own - the mighty King Tiger, with twice the armor and firepower of the original. As Stiles and his men join the Allied advance into the Nazi homeland, they soon realize that every inch of ground will be bitterly contested by the foe... and that there are worse horrors than Tigers lurking in the gloom of the last German winter.</em></p><p><em>BATTLEFIELD: MOTHERLAND By Garth Ennis and Russ Braun </em></p><p><em>Lieutenant Anna Kharkova is posted to single-seat fighter aircraft and sent straight into action. Hardened and embittered by the loss of her comrades, Anna is only too keen to get her teeth into the enemy- but with Russian and German armies about to collide in the titanic battle of Kursk, her first flight with her new squadron may well be her last. And once the Soviet secret police start sniffing around, death in battle may well be preferable anyway. Soon horrific losses land Anna with the very last thing she wants: more responsibility, in the shape of eight young replacement pilots to be trained for combat. But with the Battle of Kursk reaching its climax, rookies are nothing but lambs to the slaughter- and even the most experienced pilots find themselves flying on borrowed time. The former Night Witch meets her destiny, as Motherland- and the second series of Battlefields- conclude with a bang.</em></p><p><em>This massive 200+ Page Hardcover Edition also features bonus materials such as sketches and commentary from Ennis along with a complete cover gallery by series cover artist Garry Leach! Recommended for Mature Readers.</em></p>",

Not only that, he’s attracted to her. However, he’s just the king’s envoy, and cannot let her know his feelings. For her part, Kit is also troubled. On her journey to London on the king’s orders, she has fallen in love with Wolf. He’s different from her violent stepfather, and he's gentle and kind with both her and her elderly nursemaid. But now that she knows what the king truly wants with her, she has to dismiss her feelings for Wolf. She’s the daughter of the previous king, and now must marry the duke the king has decided on for her…!<br /></em></p>",

L'avenir ne se conjugue qu'entre de nouvelles tragédies. Pourtant, Sam et la caravane de bateaux menée par Lapointe ne perdent pas espoir. À chaque fois qu'ils tuent un zombie ou qu'ils sauvent une vie, ils entretiennent le rêve d'un monde nouveau... Mais une rumeur silencieuse, affamée et mortelle vient vers eux, une nation de morts est en marche. Les zombies ne rôdent plus sans but, ils semblent animés d'une volonté unique et avancent tous dans la même direction. Celle des survivants.</em></p><p><em>97 % MORT - 2 % VIVANT - 1 % NE SE PRONONCE PAS (ENCORE)</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Pauvre Auguste Dupin, son enquête sur la naine aux ectoplasmes piétine ; il ronchonne comme à son habitude, mais opiniâtre, suit la moindre piste. De son côté, Flora Vernet trouve un premier client en la personne d'Hugo Beyle, à qui l'on a volé somme toute bizarrement la montre à gousset au sortir d'un bouge parisien. Exploration des maigres indices, confrontation des résultats, les enquêteurs s'aperçoivent assez vite que ces deux enquêtes sont finalement liées. Et que ce lien prend une tournure qui n'a absolument plus rien de rationnel ! Crapules immondes et machiaveliques, combats acharnés, poursuites échevelées et spectre intrusif et dégoûtant... Flora devra puiser dans ses toutes dernières forces !</em></p>",
