Harold Lorre carefully orchestrates the lives of those around him. To aid him in his twisted quest, and to satiate his twisted desires. Lorre might be the most evil man alive. Join us as Lapham and artist Raulo (Capt Swing) Caceres descend into a story about the worst aspects of human behavior, a tale of unspeakable evils, violent assaults on both mind and body, and of longing for death and the sweet release it will bring. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed. Crossed: Psychopath #3 is available with a Regular cover by Jacen Burrows, a Wraparound cover by series artist Raulo Caceres, a Torture cover by Matt Martin, and a special rare Red Crossed retailer incentive.</i></p>",

The president declines to give him more time and tells Cyborg that their is a traitor among the resistance, and the president think it's the Outsider. The president says it's time for the U.S. military to finally intervene, that they can't just sit around and wait for the super-humans to save them. Element Woman is seen in the back listening to the conversation in fear.</p><p>In Wayne Manor, Gotham. Barry is \"mummy wrapped\" in bandages due to his failed attempted to recreate the scenario to become the Flash. Barry tries to try one more time, but Batman doesn't want him to because he has third degree burns on 75% of his body. Barry insists he doesn't want to forget, then a surge of new memories flash into his mind. He know remembers a bridge that leads to no where, the public reveal of Abin Sur, and dinner with his mom. He realizes he needs to move quicker before he forgets Thawne murdered his mother, his wife, and Bruce. Then Thomas helps him get to the roof for one more shot. Then the lightning bolt hits both Thomas and Barry sending Thomas flying towards the spires in his fence, and just at the last second Barry regains his power and saves Thomas from being impaled.</p><p>In New Themyscira, or what was the United Kingdom, Lois Lane is transmitting a message to Cyborg. She says that Aquaman is preparing an all-out attack tomorrow, and that will become the final battle. Then she hears Etrigan rhyme, then sees she has met up with the resistance.</p><p>In Wayne Manor, Thomas sees that Barry is recovering, and Barry decides to make his costume with the materials in the manor. Then they decide to find people they may need with Thomas' computer. Thomas and Barry rant about why doesn't Barry just go back and change everything, which Barry says he can't because he could topple dominoes like the butterfly effect. Flash tries to assemble the Justice League, but since Thawne reversed everything he also took them out of the equation. Barry has Thomas look for Superman, who's rocket hit metropolis and not the field near Smallville. They locate Cyborg who they think can locate Superman. Thomas agrees to join Cyborg's resistance if he chooses the team, and the next person is Superman, who Cyborg only knows where he is. Cyborg takes them to New Metropolis to find Project Superman who is in an underground facility two miles under Metropolis. Once they find the person who is supposed to be Superman, they find this weak, small, man who hasn't seen the sun. Then the security fires at Batman, Barry, and Cyborg. Project Superman then ditches them and flies away, leaving Barry, Cyborg and Batman pretty much to die.</p>",

Suddenly, Alfred speaks through the Batmobile's comm channel to help her.</p><p>Commissioner Gordon and Detective Gordon have dinner in a restaurant. Gordon says that since Forbes replaced him as the head of the Dawn Golden case, perhaps it is time for him to retire. Then, Forbes appears and taunts Gordon. Their discussion becomes physical, forcing two offices to restrain Forbes.</p><p>In the abandoned building, Batman talks with Penguin through a TV screen, telling him to let Dawn go. But the Penguin refuses, saying that Dawn deserves to die. The Penguin tells Batman a story of when he met Dawn. The two danced together, but Dawn's friends appeared, and they had a man uglier than the last. This humilliated the Penguin.

But first he’ll have to protect himself from Sinestro, who having learned of the Flashpoint prophecy, is hell-bent on killing him. And with his power ring’s charge running out, what extremes will he have to go to in order to save the planet Earth from total destruction?</i> <br /> <br />Having severed Abin Sur's hand, Thaal Sinestro declares his intention to save reality, a plan that involves killing his fellow Green Lantern. With his willpower, Abin summons back his lost ring, along with a prosthetic energy hand. He proceeds to destroy Sinestro's power ring, and chaining him in his place. Abin plans to save Earth, and informs the Guardians about Sinestro's betrayal. When the Guardians find out that Abin has not yet retrieved the White Entity, and that Abin accuses them of feeling fear, they cut off his ring from the central battery, so that it will pass to a new Green Lantern of Sector 2814 once Abin's charge depletes.  <br /> <br />In England, Abin Sur joins Cyborg's fight against the Amazons and Atlanteans. When the same Geo-Force device that sank Europe activates again, threatening to sink the whole planet, Cyborg orders Abin to stop it. Abin tries, but his ring's charge depletes. Believing himself to be dead, Abin encounters his late sister Arin, who instructs him to embrace his destiny as the host of the White Entity of Life. She tells him to go save the Earth, and Abin is shown trying to stabilize the planet at the end.",

In the long-awaited issue 3 of the hit miniseries Fathom: Blue Descent, fans will finally learn exactly what Aspen’s beloved necklace is…and what it can do.

Seeing that a building is about to fall on them, Leonid makes a forcefield to protect himself, Tesla, Mina (the white lady) and Michelangelo. The rampaging Celestial proceeds to zap and destroy everything around it, and throws part of a building at the floating ‘Human Machine.’ Leonardo rallies some men to blast the Celestial but it emerges unscathed. Mina in her dove-form and Tesla attack and manage to bring it down. Looking around, the heroes recover Nostradamus from under some rubble, only to see the Celestial get up again and blast directly at them. Leonid shields them, while Stark and Richards operate a large weapon that shoots the Celestial in the chest, sadly to no effect. Michelangelo intervenes and communicates with the Celestial in Newton’s ‘Quiet Math’ language, at which the Celestial thinks to itself and then teleports into the future causing more buildings to collapse. Later, the assembled heroes gather around the Human Machine, ready to follow after Newton and the Celestial.</p>",

Tensions are running high as the goddess Pandora and bayou swamp witch Anathema begin to unravel the mystery surrounding the horrific creatures which have invaded our dimension, but the enemy threat is about to reveal itself to be far worse than anyone could have imagined. A dark force from a parallel universe has possessed an innocent woman, transforming her into the fire-wielding Hellina and with the brain-washed and blood-thirsty Widow at her side, she has unleashed a reign of terror within one of Pandora’s prime business holdings, right in the heart of downtown Miami. With so many innocent lives on the line, Pandora’s options are narrowing to either hoping for some miraculous solution or killing every last person in the Promethea Building… Including her possessed allies! This epic saga is written by Mike (Lady Death) Wolfer and featured the art of Pow Rodrix wrapped in a stunning new cover by Matt Martin! Available with a Regular or Gore cover by Matt Martin, as well as a Wraparound and a special Art Nouveau Retailer Order Incentive by painter Michael Dipascale!</i></p>",

We've got a robot who's also a scientist. He fights monsters, sometimes Nazis, a mobile pyramid once, the planet Mars kinda, and also Stephen Hawking</i> <i>(though to be honest that was more of a metaphorical battle). His arch enemies include a brain in a jar, a time traveling dinosaur who isn't, and the spirit of Thomas Edison. Yeah, okay, this is the third issue in the sixth series, but it's still a great jumping on point. Check it: First issue Robo tried to rescue some astronauts. Second issue it all went horribly wrong. This issue Robo tracks down the true culprits! READ IT!</i></p>",

Unraveling this mystery is Hawkman's only chance to defeat Morphicius before he becomes unstoppable.</i></p><p>Carter returns to Professor Ziegler's lab, hoping to find more about Morphicius. Reaching the craft that contained Morphicius, Carter touches the symbols engraved on it. Suddenly, Carter's Nth metal begins reacting to the symbols. As the Nth metal armor manifests around Carter, the symbols reveals a hologram of a spaceship.</p><p>The hologram then reveals an alien that recognizes that Morphicius and his plague have been released. Apparently, Morphicius is related to a plague that caused devastation and suffering. The High Council sentenced Morphicus to forever roam space and time in the tomb. However, Morphicius has been freed and he must be stopped. The hologram says that Morphicius has a vulnerability, but the tomb explodes before the hologram can reveal it. Hawkman escapes from the explosion, realizing that Morphicius is vunerable to something he doesn't know yet. Also, Morphicius didn't escape, someone released him.</p><p>At N.L.A.S., Morphicius awakes before Kane, who introduces himself. Kane says that he is aware about the nature of the Xenusians and states that he will find a way to control Morphicius's power and take profit from it. Then, Askana begins to perform a vivisection on Morphicius.</p><p>The next morning, Carter goes to Emma's house, and she invites him a cup of coffee so that they can talk. He tells her that he went back to the lab to investigate about Morphicus. When Emma asks how can he translate alien symbols, Professor Ziegler comes in, saying that he learned not to ask too many questions when someone gets results. Carter tells the professor that someone freed Morphicus intentionally. Professor Ziegler tells him that the only man with unfettered access to the containment vessel was Terrence, and he trusts him with his life. When Carter asks Professor Ziegler where is Terrence, he replies that he hasn't seen him since yesterday at the hospital. He also says that he has been trying to phone him several times. Carter leaves, saying he is going to find Terrance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Terrance is getting into his car when he is attacked by a Xenusian creature. Suddenly, Hawkman takes the creature down and violently interrogates Terrance, wanting to know who is he working for. Terrance tells him that he will take him to Morphicius, and Hawkman carries him away.</p><p>At N.L.A.S., Askana has finished cutting Morphicius down. Kane tells Askana to freeze Morphicius's disembodied head, as it is the organism that thinks. Kane believes that the twelve organisms within Morphicius's cells can both heal and destroy. Suddenly, Morphicius' head laughs, and Kane tells Askana to get rid of him. Askana then transforms into a reptile.</p><p>Then, Hawkman and Terrance crash into Kane's lab. Terrance tells Hawkman that Kane is the one responsible, but Askana attacks Hawkman. After a short battle, Hawkman defeats Askana. Hawkman asks Askana where is Morphicius, and Askana replies that he probably escaped, and it's Hawkman fault. When Hawkman asks why, Askana replies that the man he brought with him was not a human, but one of Morphicius's plague.</p><p>Terrance is revealed to have been infected with Morphicius's plague. Then, he grabs Morphicius's head and merges it with his own body. Morphicius is fully reborn and prepares to battle Hawkman.</p><p>To be continued...</p>",

And he better do it quick. Lydia's party is in two hours and Allison's laid down an ultimatum--if he doesn't show up, their relationship is over. Jackson gets off on watching Scott's life crumble, but nothing motivates a teen-aged Werewolf like a hot girl threatening to break up with him. Can a last-minute assist from Derek and Stiles help save the day? Scott deals with the idea that he may never be human again, as the first comic book story based on MTV's new hit series concludes!</i></p>",

The irascible Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s series was a truly innovative lightning-in-a-bottle merger of comics and the spy craze of the day, and where better to start our collection than with a Nick Fury origin issue housed inside an iconic Jim Steranko cover? Next up: Steranko's last S.H.I.E.L.D. epic, 'Whatever Happened to Scorpio?,' will dazzle you before we launch into a new era of adventures including a moon-busting space mission, a mind-bending trip Fury may never come back from and a sub-earth battle with Supremus! Then, Nick Fury faces one of his oldest enemies in the Hate-Monger (a.k.a. Adolf Hitler); the British invade as Steve Parkhouse and Barry Windsor-Smith offer the one-shot 'Hell Hath No Fury;' and Hydra returns with its sights set on assassinating the S.H.I.E.L.D. director. It's a cliffhanger that will shock and surprise you! Also packed with cool covers from the Colonel's many S.H.I.E.L.D. reprint comics, and his appearance from MARVEL SPOTLIGHT #31, this Masterworks completes every fan's classic Nick Fury library!

The crew of a downed American Blackhawk and the SAS team who they were charged with extracting begin their long walk through enemy territory. But no soldiers have ever faced adversaries quite like the ones who wait in the Afghanistan desert, twisted remnants of tortured human corpses reanimated by black magic and intent of murdering every living thing within their grasp. As the mystery of the Stitched deepens and their attacks come more unexpectedly, a few tantalizing clues to their creation begin to unfold, but it’s a truth that’s almost too unbearable to believe. This new on-going series is certain to appeal to Ennis' legions of fans as it pushes the envelope of horror beyond the boundaries of sanity and into fresh nightmares. Stitched #3 is available with a Regular cover, Wraparound cover, and Gore cover by series artist Mike Wolfer, and a special Stitched Movie Photo cover retailer incentive cover.</i></p>",

Later, she was labeled a dissident by her own people. Finally, she was killed by Aspen Matthews... Now, Kiani is back-and she's pissed! Kiani learns the fatal cost of her actions after the battle with Thalassar and his forces, as the devastating response from Siphon and the Elite Council is all but a certainty. Meanwhile, Siphon, who until this point had held back in his decision on how to deal with Kiani, decides the only way to deal with the situation, is to confront her directly by force-a risky decision that could topple the very fabric of the Blue's existence in the process if he fails! Brought to you by the creative team of Vince Hernandez, Oliver Nome and John Starr, FATHOM: KIANI vol 2 #3 is a must have for any Fathom fan!</i></p>",

Considered one of the best in the Parker series, The Score is the perfect vehicle for Darwyn Cooke to pull out all the stops and let loose with a book that has all the impact of a brutal kick to the solar plexus!</i></p><h4>List of covers and their creators:</h4><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Cover</th><th scope=\"col\">Name</th><th scope=\"col\">Creator(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Sidebar Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reg</td><td>Regular Edition Cover</td><td>Darwyn Cooke</td><td>1-2</td></tr><tr><td>RE</td><td>San Diego Comic-Con Exclusive Variant Cover</td><td>Darwyn Cooke</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>UE</td><td>Updated Edition Cover</td><td>Darwyn Cooke</td><td>4-5</td></tr></tbody></table>",

            "description": "<p><i>“Ya still think it pays to fight dirty?” No bad guys can beat Walt Disney’s classic Mickey; no other “modest mouse” has seen more two-fisted action or outrageous comedy! And now our big-eared hero is back with more edge-of-your-seat adventures: traveling from Umbrellastan to Texas — and duking it out with villains like Dr. Vulter, Pegleg Pete, and malicious miser Eli Squinch!</i></p><p><i>Floyd Gottfredson, artist and writer of <b>Mickey Mouse</b>, turned the strip into a 100-proof cocktail of thrills, comedy, warmth, and cynicism. In this volume, you’ll saddle up for Gottfredson’s two most famous Wild West epics: a “Race for Riches” amid rockslides and rustlers, then a dead-shot showdown with the brutal “Bat Bandit!” Back home in Mouseton, the mayhem continues when Mickey, Donald, and Goofy run a crime-fighting newspaper — and face trouble with mobsters and speeding black sedans!</i></p><p><i>Lovingly restored from Disney’s proof sheets, <b>High Noon at Inferno Gulch</b> also includes more than 50 pages of rootin’-tootin’ supplementary features! You’ll enjoy rare behind-the-scenes art, vintage publicity material, and vivid commentary by a pistol-packin’ posse of seasoned Disney scholars, including a Foreword by Thomas Andrae and an appreciation by the late Bill Blackbeard.</i></p><p><i>Walt Disney often said that his studio’s success “all started with a Mouse.” Now it’s time to rediscover the wild, unforgettable personality behind the icon!</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>The long-awaited third volume of Crossed is finally here, collecting all seven issues of the Psychopath series by David Lapham and artist Raulo Caceres! In one terrifying moment, civilization crumbled. An outbreak of insanity swept across the planet, turning millions of people into the scarred homicidal maniacs known as 'the Crossed.' For one small band of survivors, the discovery of a starving, injured man in the desert seems like an unexpected blessing. He knows where they could be safe: the location of the last holdout of the scientific community, where the military offers protection and the cure to the Crossed plague is being developed. But Harold Lorre is not the savior they hope him to be. He's a calculating, lethal man whose mind was dangerously unhinged even before the world went mad. Surrounded by marauding hordes, their nerves shattered by unending fear, the group fall victim to the manipulations and deadly perversions of a psychopath. Writer David Lapham, the critically acclaimed creator of Stray Bullets, returns to the universe of Crossed with a descent into evil so far beyond what you could possibly imagine. Available in three editions: as a TPB or Hardcover with new covers by series artist Raulo Caceres and also a Signed Hardcover, with a new Caceres cover, signed by writer David Lapham and limited to just 1000 copies!</i></p>",

In 1954, the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency targeted this comic series for its graphic violence, eventually leading to the creation of the repressive Comics Code Authority. Issues #30 to #33 of <b>Crime Does Not Pay</b> are finally collected in this deluxe hardcover, which includes “Million Dollar Robbery”—perhaps the first story in US comics history drawn by an African-American artist—and features a new introduction by comic-book giant Howard Chaykin (<b>Marked Man</b>, <b>American Flagg!</b>).</i></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Deadpool vs. Dead Presidents…this time, TRICKY DICK NIXON! Can even Doctor Strange help the M w/the M? This is the Deadpool series you will marry someday!</i></p><p>Deadpool finishes telling Dr. Strange about the recent events with the dead presidents coming back to life via a necromancer. Dr. Strange, however, is unimpressed and is about to show Deadpool, Agent Preston, and the ghost of Benjamin Franklin to the door but first takes a peak into the story to give the trio a real look at what is going on. Opening his third eye, Dr. Strange is surprised to find Richard Nixon raising from the dead. Dr. Strange explains that the necromancer is working with powers he knows little about and is bringing the presidents back to life without their humanity. He leaves to meditate. Wong instructs the visitors to be ready to depart at a moment's notice.</p><p>Some presidents meet in a family dentistry to try and resolve a dispute concerning the course of action to take. A spaceship has been proposed and Ford has to remind everyone that the nation doesn't even have a space program anymore. The necromancer, shackled, tries to spout some sorcery to help him escape but Ford knocks the wind out of him. This little bit of incantations is enough for Dr. Strange to locate the men and he teleports the group to the dentistry (minus Ben Franklin because he is still mad about a past indiscretion). Deadpool begins shooting presidents while Dr. Strange vanishes with the necromancer. The spell book the necromancer uses is dropped, however, and Washington claims it to aid in future destruction.</p><p>On the astral plane, Dr. Strange banishes the necromancy from Michael the necromancer. Michael then explains that he learned of his skills when he was in fifth grade and had wished life back into his dead hamster. He was later recruited out of college and trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. to hone his powers.</p><p>Outside the dentistry, Deadpool takes on Washington, Ford, and Lincoln. He tells Agent Preston to leave and she does so with the promise to return with more help. Deadpool is smashed inside a car, receives a sword in the back, and then kicked into a building. He thinks help has arrived when a helicopter touches down but it is only more dead presidents. Nixon hops off and recognizes that he's at Watergate. Ford trips and gets sliced to bits by the helicopter's rotor blade. Dr. Strange returns as the helicopter departs. He pulls Washington's sword from Deadpool's back and begins another round of meditation. Deadpool turns his attention to Nixon who is bent on destroying Watergate. Deadpool attacks but is quickly thrown into an elderly woman's apartment. Nixon follows and starts whooping Deadpool until the merc can kick Nixon in the Little Nixon. Dr. Strange then appears and gives Deadpool the Washington sword and explains that it is now enchanted to fell the undead. Deadpool wastes no time in sticking it in Nixon's chest. The president explodes in a flash of pink light.</p><p>Outside, Dr. Strange explains that the sword should help Deadpool defeat the rest of the undead presidents. He then whispers a seemingly dire observation to Deadpool and departs. Agent Preston states that Michael the necromancer is cooperating and they'll have to see what comes next.</p>",

This issue tells a two-fisted tale of crime noir fiction entitled \"TRUST\". Brought to you by the decidedly-twisted good folks at Rat Race Comix m Bodine Amerikah and Jason Paulos. Here comes the thundering saga of a Down Under private dick who does not go gently into that good night. You know him, you love him! Yes, it's HAIRBUTT THE HIPPO, he of the nasty temperament and even nastier personal grooming habits. Like one of the covers boasts, \"Uncut! Uncensored! Unashamed! Unhygenic!\"</em></p>",

The brothers made the first controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight on 17 December 1903 and, in the two subsequent years, they developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed wing flight possible.</em></p>",

Meanwhile, back in the World, Sen. Robert Kennedy has an important day of his own. New soldiers enter the war, and old ones leave it - and there are too many bad ways to leave a war. Plus: The battle lines get even blurrier as enemies display their humanity, and soldiers show their darker sides. Includes rarely seen stories from Marvel's black-and-white magazines.</em></p><p><em>Collects The 'Nam #21-30 and material from Savage Tales (1985) #1 and #4.</em></p>",
