You know, before that red-headed would-be messiah/destroyer of the world showed up, Cable had another partner. That’s right: Wade Wilson -- a.k.a. Deadpool! And while everybody’s excited about Cable bringing Hope back to the present to rejoin the X-Men, they’re forgetting the most important part of the story: The beginning, back when Cable first lifted the helpless baby out of her incubator up in Alaska. Wait -- You don’t think Cable did that alone, did you? You don’t think he managed to make his way across hundreds of miles, avoiding Predator X and Purifiers without a little assist, do you? Hell no. Cable asked for help from his favorite Merc with a Mouth and now, finally, this action-packed, oversized story can be told. Before there can be an end, there must be a beginning</em></p><p>Cable hired Deadpool to help escort the baby to the future. So Cable and Deadpool fought the Purifiers and other mutants who all wanted the baby. After that Cable and Deadpool retreated to the mountains with the baby until Predator X came after them. Deadpool tried to take him out but Predator X ate Deadpool. Cable ran away from the monster until Predator X spit Deadpool out. Deadpool then told Cable to run and then he pressed a button that set off a bomb that Deadpool put in Predator X's stomach. So Predator X died but right after that a sentinel came to destroy all mutants in the area. Cable took cover and dodging the sentinel attacks. Deadpool then distracted the sentinel by wearing a suit made out of the body parts of Predator X. The sentinel then ran after Deadpool until the sentinel fell into a hole. The fall destroyed the sentinel but not Deadpool because he was holding onto a rope.

When they come in, a discussion starts as to whether the error from the past imperfect has vanished completely. Other beings search the logs of the past Guardians and discover that the error happened in <b>2009 A.D.</b> They cannot discern the cause, initially blaming a parallel version of Major victory for the rupture of the timeline. However, Starhawk soon realizes that the devious <b>Thanos</b> had been resurrected at that point of time, and that he was the cause of the error.</p><p><b>2010 A.D.</b></p><p>The remaining members of the <b>Guardians</b> travel to the planet of <b>Sacrosanct</b>.

He is angry for being wrongfully woken from eternal slumber and brought back to life. He destroys everything in his path, and Sacrosanct is itself proof of that. The Guardians try to stop Thanos, but fail to do any considerable damage. Even the combined power of the telepaths cannot break his mental shield. <b>Starlord</b> knows that they have little time, before Thanos decimates them. So he plays the last ace up his sleeve.</p><p>He calls Thanos and shows him the <b>cosmic cube</b>, that <b>Kang</b> had given him earlier. Thanos forgets his rage and stares at the cube, bathing in the magnificent glory of its sheer, raw power. As he comes too close, Starlord wishes a last burst of power from the cube. The cube levels Thanos with one single blast before extinguishing itself. The telepaths take control immediately. Still, Thanos murmurs that <b><i>his resurrection will cause the death of every living being in the universe</i></b>.</p><p>Later, back inside <b>Knowhere</b>, Starlord honors the memory of <b>Phyla-Vell</b> and other brave souls who have fallen in the wars.

            "description": "<p><em>Your complete guide to the award winning BBC One series!</em></p><p><em>Written and researched by Andrew Pixley</em></p><p><em>Despite not returning to television for a full series in 2009, Doctor Who reached new levels of success over the last year, as over twelve million avid viewers watched, gripped, as the Tenth Doctor's adventures reached an end. Having had to part company with his friend Donna Noble, the Doctor continued his travels alone. His next stop was a trip back in time to a Victorian Christmas, where he was amazed to meet another version of himself — and a threat from the terrifying Cybermen! From there he journeyed on, finding himself trapped on the desert planet of San Helios, with a Number 200 London bus, and a deadly swarm on the horizon. He next travelled to the famous red planet of Mars, as the last of the Time Lords found himself battling against the forces of time itself. From there, the Doctor had to face up to his own destiny, as he faced not only a showdown with his old enemy, the Master, but also had to come to terms with the prospect of the return of his own people, the Time Lords. And through all this, there is the ever-present mysterious prophecy, that the Doctor's death is coming, when “he will knock four times …”</em></p><p><em>Now Doctor Who Magazine takes you behind the scenes of all the Tenth Doctor's final episodes, with an in-depth episode-by-episode guide, including original storylines, deleted scenes, and thousands of facts about the day to day life of making Doctor Who — all illustrated with gorgeous, never-before-seen photographs. This Special covers The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, and the apocalyptic two-part finale, The End of Time, plus the Proms Special Music of the Spheres and the animated adventure Dreamland.</em></p><p><em>This is your essential guide to the worlds of Doctor Who. Get ready for the Tenth Doctor's final battles …</em></p>",
