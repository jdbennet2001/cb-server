Can you successfully identify every character featured, The Avengers and the JLA have confronted their foemen - now it's time to party! But as echoes of the past intrude on the present, something is terrifyingly wrong.</i></p><h3>Plot Summary</h3><p>A powerful and dangerous hunter stalks reality.</p><p>Krona, immortal scientist and renegade, seeks to learn the truth of all creation. His investigations, however, tear apart the fabric of the universes, destroying them. Cast out of his home reality, he wanders the multiverse, leaving destruction in his path.</p><p>In one universe, he encounters the grandmaster, a cosmic game-player with enough power to check him, if only temporarily. The grandmaster tells Krona he knows of a being that lived through the creation of his universe and knows what came before - Galactus, devourer of worlds. Krona agrees to play a game. If he wins, Galactus's knowledge will be his - even if his quest destroys the Grandmaster's universe. If he loses, he will leave in peace.</p><p>The Grandmaster, working with Metron of the New Gods, manipulates the champion of two worlds - the Avengers, from his own reality, and the JLA, from Krona's reality - into a race to recover twelve items of cosmic power. Krona swaps champions, however, so the Avengers fight for him, while the JLA fight for the Grandmaster.</p><p>During the competition, each team sees the other's world, and members - notably Superman and captain America - react badly. Superman sees the Avengers' world as a sorry shambles where the heroes don't try hard enough. Captain America sees the JLA's world as a totalitarian state where super-human's rule.</p><p>In addition, Batman convinces Captain America to break away from the competition and seek the truth behind it. They discover the existence of the game, and the stakes.</p><p>Between them, they arrange for the JLA to win, safeguarding the Avengers' universe. But Krona lashes out, attacking the Grandmaster, summoning Galactus and beginning to wrest his secrets from him.</p><p>It's then that the Grandmaster reveals his true purpose - the game was just a feint, to assemble the items of power under Krona's nose. Tapping into them, he unleashes their power and everything changes.</p><p>After racing to collect the items of power that were promised could save their worlds, the JLA and Avengers are shocked when Krona, losing his game with the Grandmaster, attempts to force the secrets he seeks from Galactus. The Grandmaster reveals his treachery, and steals the items of power. Reality has become warped, and the two teams must work together to fix it.</p><p>George Perez injured his hand on the cover to this issue.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Domino's search for her past has led her to a remote area in the Florida Everglades where an unforeseen enemy is waiting to make sure she doesn't have a future!</em></p><p>Domino is at Jonathan’s funeral when she receives a call on her mobile from her old friend, Siryn. She informs her that her record checking has revealed that Jonathan was working both sides in order to liberate precious items and sell them to the highest bidder. Domino is shocked. Siryn tells her about a contact of his, Krusny Silyotka, who is anxious to get hold of the weapon he has been promised. Domino asks her to reply to one of his e-mails as if she were Jonathan and let him know everything is going according to plan. She is going to find the weapon herself. The Armajesuits, meanwhile, are happy to allow Domino to do their work for them but appear to want the weapon for themselves in order to save civilization. Domino travels to Florida and is attacked by a group of soldiers as she approaches a military bunker. Her dead body is found after she is believed killed in an explosion and taken to the bunker where Project Armageddon is located. There, Dr. McKay performs an autopsy and discovers the body has been dead for some days now. Domino surprises him and knocks him out before exploding his laboratory to cause confusion on the base. She had got the body from a morgue in Miami and painted it white to look like her. Sneaking away disguised as a soldier, Domino finds computer controlled access doors and hacks her way through them before gracefully using her luck factor to avoid laser traps and open the door to Project Armageddon. Inside, Domino surprisingly discovers a small child who looks just like her. Meanwhile, lookout guards on the base’s perimeter discover a small army of Armajesuits armed and purposeful and about to enter the base.</p><p><b>Full Synopsis: </b></p><p>(day eighteen)</p><p>Jonathan’s life is at an end. Domino attends his funeral and, once the mourners have departed, kneels down and places a red rose on his coffin. She doesn’t feel so lucky now, not when she can’t protect the people she cares about; not when the person who used to help her get better is in a box. She thanks him for opening her eyes and helping her to focus inward instead of aimlessly wandering. He gave her a whole new perspective about who and what she is and for that she’ll always be grateful. Typical, she thinks, that she didn’t even get to the payback part.</p><p>As she stands, her mobile goes off and she answers. Siryn is on the other end, dressed in civvies and relaxing as she speaks with her old friend. She tells Domino that she’s managed to salvage a bit of information from the laptop she pulled from the fire. She says, “Ye say y’knew this Jonathan guy longer than ye knew me?” Domino replies that they did some importing and exporting. Theresa tells her that maybe she didn’t know him as well as she thought, as Jonathan was playing <i>both</i> sides, using her and others to ‘liberate’ precious items, only to sell those items to the highest bidder. “And that’s just the tip,” she adds as she taps away on her computer. Domino looks surprised, her face dropping as she asks if she has proof. Theresa tells her that she has e-mails, letters, files and she’ll get her hard copies. He was dirty.</p><p>This isn’t the news Domino needs right now but she knows she has to face facts. She rubs her forehead, partly in frustration, partly in disbelief and asks Theresa to go on. She reminds Domino that she had been asked to try and find Project Armageddon too. Well, she found numerous recent e-mails from someone identified only as Krusny Silyotka. Krusny is livid that that Jonathan hasn’t responded since the explosion and is doubting Jonathan’s ability to deliver the weapon at all. Coincidentally, she continues, the CD in his computer seems to be a blue map of the same operation. Domino tells her that she knows; Jonathan stole it from her. Siryn puts her feet up and informs Domino that Jonathan has 96 hours to deliver the weapon or Krusny will send <i>his</i> people to finish the job. Domino thinks Krusny is bluffing, for if he knew the weapon’s location, Jonathan wouldn’t have been necessary. She asks Theresa to respond and tell Krusny to be patient; all will be taken care of in the allotted time. “You’re gonna find this ‘weapon’ yerself?” asks Theresa. Domino says she was just talking to Jonathan about some payback and doesn’t have a choice anymore.</p><p>(day nineteen)</p><p>Inside the mysterious mountain, the man in the red robe sits behind a desk, looking at what appears to be a computer screen. Behind him is a huge window in the shape of a cross, just like the one on the mountainside. Three of his robed disciples bow before him, interrupting his meditation. They apologize to him, informing him they have just returned from their most holy mission. He prompts them to continue with their report. One of them tells him that they encountered the one called Domino and, as mandated, she was <i>not</i> harmed. Another says that her knowledge of Project Armageddon grows and she has possibly uncovered the location of the weapon. He adds that he has heard foolish doubts within their own ranks. Some think it may be unwise to allow her to live as her resourcefulness could yet jeopardize their efforts to protect society from itself. Their leader replies that this is all the more reason to allow her to continue to do their work for them. She does the labor while they reap the benefits. He asks them to tell the doubters that they are wise not to underestimate their catspaw and arrogance is a mistake they can ill afford, but so is disloyalty. His left hand is shown to be gauntleted as he watches two men prepare his costume. His skin is also flesh-colored while his disciples’ skin is a whitish/grey.</p><p>He stands with his arms outstretched in front of the large statue of Christ as the two men place a sash around his shoulders. He tells his followers that everything has gone according to plan. They have Domino and her <i>vast</i> resources serving their needs and the death of her associate will further her resolve. Vengeance will drive her to do the impossible. As he takes a mask, he continues to say that they will follow, capitalizing on her immaturity and her propensity for leaving loose ends. Domino will find what they seek; leading them to the door she leaves ajar, even as she passes unnoticed.</p><p>Placing the mask over his face, he continues to say that, under the guise of protecting them all, they allowed foolish hands to protect the world. Now, with those hands prepared to strike, they must reclaim what they see as the <i>ultimate weapon</i>. The fools would jeopardize everything for a military goal; the foundation of civilization could collapse. He reaches out and takes a sword in his uncovered hand and adds that they have searched for years at great cost and, if Domino has the skills to lead them to heir prey and gain entry without capture, they may yet succeed in saving the world. He kneels down, holding the sword vertically and asks his followers to pray for the wisdom and strength to succeed. He then stands and holds the sword out in front of him, saying that it has been foreseen that if they fail in their appointed task, their path ends in death. “Hear me Armajesuits! I swear you this - we will not fail!” Their place of worship is shown in all its grandeur, a massive church with the Christ statue dominating the room.</p><p>(day twenty)</p><p>In the Florida Everglades, an alligator swims calmly through the river before being disturbed by a swamp craft being driven determinedly by Domino as the sun sets. She is wearing some hi-tech orange goggles and her standard costume. She thinks about her mission. She wonders which frightens her more; finding the woman behind those yellow memories and faded photos, facing a weapon supposedly capable of destroying entire civilizations, or doing it <i>all</i> alone. As the sun drops below the horizon, she cuts the engine and coasts her way in as she reaches her destination. She is close, she can feel it. Suddenly, a voice calls her to halt and a blinding light freezes her. She removes her sunglasses and momentarily catches sight of her assailants. Her craft then explodes in a huge ball of flame and smoke, shaking the swampland.</p><p>Three soldiers dressed in black fatigues and carrying heavy artillery watch as the flames die down. They stand knee-deep in the water as one of them tells Charlie to hose it down good as the General’s going to want to see evidence, charbroiled or not. Discovering what appears to be the body of Domino he replies, “Hey, it’s a chick. Your lucky day pal!” The third soldier says that maybe they should have waited before frying her. She got lucky and what’s left of the body doesn’t look half bad. Charlie tells them to get the body back to base and get an I.D. He’ll take care of the mess. The other two place the body in their inflatable, commenting on how heavy the body is, probably due to all the muscle on her. Charlie turns as they depart; reminding them to make sure the sentries know he’s coming through in a few. He doesn’t want his butt shot off because of them.</p><p>Back at their base, a bunker in the ground with watchtowers jutting out of the top, the General is shaving and orders his assistant to answer the phone. An American flag hangs beside him. The man informs the General that there’s a minor situation. Apparently, he tells him, some local, a woman this time, has breached their perimeter and their boys used cautionary force. They recovered her body and he asks if he wants an autopsy performed. The General asks why he is being disturbed over routine details, telling him to get the body identified. “Am I surrounded by a bunch of simpletons that I need to reconfirm standing orders?” he adds. His assistant tells his caller that the General says that they are a simpleton and to take care of it. Even if the dead woman is the sister of the first lady, he tells them, do not disturb the General again. If it <i>is</i> the first lady, then wait until morning.</p><p>Elsewhere in the bunker, Dr. McKay prepares to perform an autopsy on Domino’s body in the Forensics Department. He grabs a pair of scissors as he mutters to himself. He isn’t happy about having to perform another autopsy in the middle of the night. Bodies tend to show up and they have to move the whole base again. He can’t wait to pack. He looks at the body. “Female. Caucasian… I think. White paint has been applied to the outer epidermis, covering the entire body. Age…approximately early-to-mid-thirties.” Suddenly, he spots something unusual and runs his finger over existing scars lining the woman’s chest. He realizes that the body has <i>already</i> been autopsied. The body can’t be from tonight as she’s been dead for days. He looks round and asks who’s playing the joke on him.</p><p>The <i>real</i> Domino appears behind him, brandishing a pistol and says <i>that</i> would be her. She tells him that wasn’t bad joke considering she’s a deadly killer but, before he busts a gut laughing, maybe he should take a seat and a tranquilizer. She shoots the doctor and catches him before he falls. Although he’s passed out, she tells him to think positive; after all, when the Miami morgue calls he can tell them he found their missing cadaver. She releases a grenade and destroys the laboratory. The bunker’s staff are shocked as a plume of smoke billows up the corridor.</p><p>Soldiers are quickly on the scene and Peterson orders his men to put the fire out. He asks Tolbert how the doc is and ‘he‘ replies that he’s unconscious but alive. He orders Barrymore and Willis to put out the fire while the rest of them secure the area. He wants every room, corner and shadow inspected and tells them to shoot first and forget about any questions. The doctor is dragged to safety as they do so by Domino, who is dressed just like them, impersonating Tolbert. No-one notices her as she takes the doc into another room and whips the soldier’s uniform off. “Objective one complete,” she says, “The enemy is confused and disoriented. Now to make that work for me. Secure the Armageddon weapon then see if mom is actually hanging around.”</p><p>Inside one of the bunker’s raised watchtowers, Stan and his colleague receive news about what’s happened. Stan receives a message on the radio while his friend says he has a bad feeling about this and points at the computer screens, telling him that Sector 7 just went code orange. The med center is a total wash; fire bombed and their orders are to hold their post. Stan is frustrated that they’ve been in ‘Satan’s armpit’ for six months and when something finally happens they get stuck on mosquito watch. His friend replies that he’s crazy; he’s had his share of combat experience in the special forces and asks him to trust him that it isn’t that glamorized Hollywood crap either. He’s perfectly happy to get out of there if all he has to gory about are mosquito attacks.</p><p>A footstep is heard outside and Stan’s colleague steps over to the spotlight, pointing it outside and tells Stan that he heard something. Stan replies that he’s just scared and decides to check it out, heading out of the tower and into the grassy marsh surrounding the base. His friend calls after him but Stan replies that he knows he has a bad feeling about this but he should grow a backbone. He stops and looks into the trees, which are lit only by moonlight now, and hears nothing, not even a frog croaking. He turns to taunt his colleague a little, telling him it would send shivers down his spine. “Oh wait, you ain’t <i>got</i> a spine, right?” he turns back and finds standing before him one of the Armajesuits wielding a sword. Stan’s colleague spots them but it’s too late for Stan. Behind the first one stand around twenty-five to thirty more of them, all armed with swords.</p><p>The General has now made his way to the operations center and is pulling a back shirt over his muscular torso as he tells Peterson, who is looking at a large screen, arms folded behind his back, that he doesn’t like being awakened in the middle of the night by an explosion in his own facility. He wants to know exactly <i>what</i> happened, <i>how</i> security was breached and <i>who</i>, besides Peterson himself is to be assigned to permanent sewer detail for allowing this to happen. He turns to face the General and informs him that the medical lab is on fire, the fire being a result of the blast he heard. Dr. McKay was alone when the explosion took place and was performing an autopsy on the civilian they found on the perimeter. The General asks if the doctor is alive and if he’s been questioned. Peterson salutes, replying that the doctor has momentarily disappeared. The General turns and orders Peterson to go to code red. Only essential personnel will remain in Sector 7 to control the fire. All others will be redirected to the Project Armageddon corridor. Peterson tries to tell him something but the General tells him not to wait until he <i>has</i> a problem to <i>solve</i> a problem and reminds him to give the order to “shoot to kill.”</p><p>Domino, meanwhile, has taken out more security guards and hacked her way through a computer controlled access door with the laptop she carries in her backpack. She removes the rest of the bulky soldier’s uniform, leaving her in little more than a skin-tight, black leotard. She puts on the goggles and changes their settings, turning them green which allow her to see a laser grid criss-crossing its way down the corridor in front of her and she thinks ‘bingo.’ She doesn’t hesitate for a second as she begins a gymnastic tumble, gracefully leaping, turning and pirouetting her way through the gaps in the lasers before arriving safely at the next access door. She uses the incredible strength in her legs to hold herself upside-down outside the door which has the words ‘Project Armageddon’ written boldly on it.</p><p>Okay, she thinks, what have we here? A combination lock. She changes the setting on her goggles again which allows her to see the residue of fingerprints used to open the door previously which stand out in blue. The prints allow her to narrow the code down to just a few hundred thousand possible combinations. She holds her breath and reaches out, pressing the buttons randomly and hoping lady luck will pay her a visit. She does, and the door swings open as Domino smiles, opening the door further.</p><p>In the operations center, one of the staff informs the general that the security seal to Project Armageddon has just been compromised. He becomes agitated, asking by whom. He asks where the squadrons are that he deployed to that sector and wants them there immediately. He also demands to know what’s going on at the front gate. He wants bodies, telling his men to shoot anything that moves on sight. He doesn’t know who or what has dared to enter his base but they’re not leaving.</p><p>Domino, meanwhile, enters the room and whips off her goggles. She points her gun in front of her but, as she focuses on what is inside, her eyes widen and a look of shock and surprise covers her face. Standing before her is a small child, wearing an Umbro shirt and standing in what appears to be a playroom. The child looks like a small version of Domino, complete with one black eye, who tells her “Hello.”</p><p> </p>",

Fusa tells Wolverine that 11 years ealier, </p><p>scientists created a microorganism that would naturally decompose the toxic materials that were poisoning the Earth. They altered the genetic makeup of strains of flesh-eating bacteria so it would eat only the toxins but ignore living tissue, so it could be unleashed to destroy the poison without hurting complex life forms like humans. The scientists couldn't contain the bacteria (now called The Mandate) outside of the lab so they created organic orbs in which to store and transport it. That's when things went bad. The genetic mutations had actually allowed The Mandate to develop sentience. After sentience, The Mandate desired a body, so they shaped themselves into a bipedal creature. Now independently mobile, The Mandate used their toxin and flesh eating properties (which they had kept hidden) to destroy everything in it's path. In days the single original Mandate had wiped out the city where it was created. Then it started to multiply. The original, called the Primogenitor, was capable of producing offspring and they quickly started showing up all around the world. By the time the rest of the world new the danger, it was already to late. They developed Anti-Mandate Armored Corps (robots with armor and ammunition made of adamantium, the only thing that can pierce the orb-core and kill The Mandate) to fight the Mandate, but the adaptive abilities of the bacteria was too much for them to combat. Most people were killed and a few hid underground. </p><p>Logan eventually decides to help Fusa and her people so he, The Colonel and some other willing men prepare to find and kill the Primogenitor.</p>",

X-23 is in bed masquerading as a prostitute. A man gets out of the bed and pays her, telling her that she will go far in the city. He puts on his shirt revealing massive scratch marks made by X-23.</p><p>Back at Cams apartment, Kiden has phoned an ambulance and they ask her questions about Cameron. Kiden replies only to ask if she can ride in the ambulance with Cam.</p><p>Down 34th street, X-23 stands in the rain, her eyeliner dripping down her face. A car pulls up and the window winds down. A mans face is shown. His name is Zebra Daddy. Back at the hospital, Cam wakes up and Kiden is full of life again.</p><p>At the Flatiron district, Zebra Daddy explains to X-23 how much he loves her. She doesn't reply but Zebra Daddy doesn't give her a chance to as he confronts her about emo cuts down her arm. He says she'll lose business if she keeps it up. Then he calls for a woman named Jade. He tells her a man wants to buy some drugs off her. She tells him she knows the man and he hurt her before. Daddy beats her up and tells her he only cares about the money, not her safety. X-23 slits her arm again.</p><p>Cameron is now back at her place and is eating soup with Kiden. She expresses her concern for Kidens mother and her temper flares. Kiden then says that she's a time controlling mutant and Cam says that just because she's been through a lot that doesnt make her a mutant. She then gets angry and tells Kiden if she isn't at her mums place by dawn shes calling the child welfare agency.</p><p>Over at hotel Brasil X-23 has just done business with the same man again. He tells her he's done some bad things in his life and reveals he is married. He pulls out a knife and stabs himself through the chest.</p><p>Kiden is asleep on Camerons sofa when an image of her father appears in her dream. He is shot, then gets up and says \"Hotel Brasil, 202\" Kiden wakes up screaming and writes down the name on a bit of paper. The ink sinks through a few sheets so when Cam gets up she goes after kiden.</p><p>Upon arrival Kiden and Cam see the man lying dead on the floor and X-23 on the bed, slitting her arms again. She says 'hi' to them and the issue ends.</p>",

Kevin is hidding at a yunkyard when a dog attacks him. The dog dies victim to his powers. A couple of men find Kevin and after seeing what he did to the dog, they attack him. Moonstar arrives just in time to save him. We learn that Kevin killed his own father by accident when his powers manifested. Moonstar takes him to Xavier's. We also find out that Magma is in a coma.</em></p><p><i>Synopsis</i></p><p>Danielle Moonstar is ready to leave to recruit a kid from Atlanta. Professor X emphasizes to Dani that she must use discretion in outing the mutant even though the school is now public. Professor X looks at a photograph of the original New Mutants. The two old friends reflect over their losses in a close-up to Cypher and Illyana Rasputin.</p><p>*<b>Danielle Moonstar</b>: \"By the way, I heard Allison came back to the school, but I haven't seen her yet.\"*</p><p>*<b>Professor X</b>: \"She's...away.\"*</p><p>*<b>Danielle Moonstar</b>: \"If she gets back before I do, tell her I said hi.

Sofia is called to approach the board when the bell rings.</p><p>Sofia meets with Julian outside her class. Julian offers to be Sofia's guide around the place and Sofia asks if there's any place to dance. Laurie walks by and Sofia offers her to have lunch but Julian rudely remarks her roommate is a freak.</p><p>*<b>Julian Keller</b>: \"She's weird. She doesn't fit in here. And that's a <b>challenge</b>. To be a freak among <b>freaks</b>.\"*</p><p>Sofia flirts with Julian, caressing his hair and his ear with her hand.</p><p>*<b>Sofia Mantega</b>: \"Yes. I love to dance...*</p><p><i>To enjoy the rhythm of the music...</i></p><p>*But you could <b>not</b> keep up with me\"*</p><p>Julian loses his balance and Sofia reveals she made \"the wind [rattle] in his ear\".</p><p>Meanwhile, Moonstar arrives at the Ford home in Atlanta. No one is home and everything seems normal except for a worn shirt and a pile of ash.</p><p>Elswhere in Atlanta, a young boy walks in a park draped in a green cloth. People stare as he goes to a junk yard to be alone. He watches the sunset, seemingly reflective, until a vicious dog attacks him. The dog bites his arm and drops dead on the ground.</p><p>Danielle visits the Ford boy's school. Kevin's teacher vouches that Kevin is a good kid raised by a single father, but records show he had missed the last couple of days of school. Turns out Kevin Ford is an artistic prodigy who can \"bring life to scraps of metal\".</p><p>*<b>Teacher</b>: \"While most kids his age are hanging out at the mall, Kevin's sneaking into that old junk yard to gather material.\"*</p><p>Back at the junkyard, two workers discover their dead dog and begin to attack Kevin. Not willing to kill, he gets kicked in the stomach and beat with a pipe until Danielle arrives and defends the lost and confused young mutant.</p><p>Kevin explains his mutant power to decay matter and Danielle pieces together what happened to Kevin's father. Kevin explains that when he first discovered his mutant ability, he began experimenting on flowers and other items around the house. His father came home as Kevin began to panic and tried to comfort his son, but the skin-to-skin contact ended fatally.</p><p>They return to his home to get him some clothes (polyester as apparently he only decays organic matter). Kevin is afraid Danielle will take him to jail, but his worry turns into enthusiasm when he finds out she's taking him to the XAVIER INSTITUTE!</p><p>Back at the mansion, Nurse Annie checks on Kevin who is excited to one day become an X-Man. Professor Xavier reveals to Danielle that Magma was crucified on the lawn of the Institute by the Church of Humanity (--see Chuck Austen's Uncanny X-Men).

When I found Kevin, they were <b>beating</b> him with a lead pipe! The <b>world</b> isn't safe.\"*</p><p>Danielle encourages the Professor that the dream is still alive and that the school is a save haven for mutants.</p><p>*<b>Danielle Moonstar</b>: \"You're not perfect, Charles.
