Could it get any worse for Carol Danvers? You bet – because as our heroine battles the cybernetic psychopath known as the Doomsday Man, she learns a terrifying truth about herself! All this, plus Araña and Wonder Man! Writer Brian Reed (New Avengers: Illuminati) and penciler Roberto De La Torre welcome onboard new cover artist Greg Horn (She-Hulk) – and get you ready for next month’s new era!</em></p><p>Carol Danvers, Ms. Marvel continues to fight inside an A.I.M. facility where the Doomsday Man was kept. She finds herself fighting a horde of zombies. It turns out that they are contageous. The slightest touch turns that person into a zombie.</p><p>Thinking she can defeat the Doomsday Man as she did in the past, Carol finds that he's had some <em>upgrades</em>. She has also become infected by a zombie. Doomsday Man takes advantage of this and nearly defeats her.</p><p>Thinking she's about to die, Carol sees a bright light and hears voices. Somehow, her broken rib and zombie infection have been healed.</p><p>Tired of waiting outside, <a data-ref-id=\"40598\" href=\"/ara-a/40598/\" slug=\"ara-a\">Araña</a> ventures inside to join the fight. Doomsday Man tears her carapace off, not knowing that it's not just a costume but part of Anya.</p><p>Enraged, Carol knocks Doomsday Man outside and gives him a serious beat-down. She tears Kerwin Korman out of the Doomsday suit. With a \"thank you,\" Korman passes out.</p><p>At an A.I.M. bunker, it seems that involving Ms. Marvel with the Doomsday suit was a plan to test it out.

            "description": "<p>Kyle continues to fight Grayven. After getting distracted by a message from Guy about his mother's poor condition, Grayven was able to get a hold of Kyle from behind. He has his hands wrapped around his neck and Kyle cannot break free. Grayven mentions that his friends will be happy with one less obstacle once Kyle is dead. It seems Grayven has forgotten about Donna Troy as she smashes him from behind. All Kyle knows is he needs to get back to Earth now. His message from Guy got cut off. He knows Grayven is somehow involved and demands to know what's happening to his mother. Kyle's not going to stand for someone threatening his mother again. He says he'll do anything to prevent going through that again.</p><p>As Kyle grabs hold of Grayven and asks him again, Grayven just smiles at him. Kyle told him he gave him a chance. His hands grab hold of Grayven's head on either side and his hands begin to glow brighter and brighter. Grayven begs him to stop as there is a big blast. Grayven is out. Donna asks Kyle if he's dead and he responds that he doesn't know or care. He puts him in an energy bubble and sends him off to the Guardians.</p><p>Donna and Kyle begin to return to Earth when a Monitor appears before them. The Monitor says that Kyle poses a \"grave danger\" and should be destroyed along with the other anomalies. As he prepares to blast Kyle, Kyle shoots first. The monitor appears to have been vaporized but has been pulled back to the other Monitors. They tell him this is not the time to react. When that time comes, they will act together.</p><p>Kyle and Donna arrive at his mother's hospital room. Guy, Kilowog, and Soranik are there. Guy tells him that everyone did everything that they could. Kyle's mom is dead. As Donna embraces him, trying to offer some comfort, Kyle realizes that it doesn't have to be this way. He can fix things. Using his power, he reanimates his mom. As she comes to and talks to him, she realizes something isn't right. She tells him he needs to accept what has happened and that she loves him. Kyle removes the power as she asks and she crumples into his arms.</p><p>At the funeral, Kyle thinks about everything that had to be done, all the preparations. The man claiming to be his father never showed. He figures that's a good thing. He now has to figure out what to do with her possessions and sell her house. Eventually he finds himself alone.</p><p>Back at the artists' retreat, his friends try to console them in their way. As he sits in his studio, his neighbor leaves a painting she did for him. A single rose with the words, \"So sorry for your loss.\" Kyle is still distraught with all that has happened. He has painted pictures of all the women in his life that he has lost: Alex, Donna, Jade, and his mother. He cannot help but feel that with everything he has recently gone through, it's not over yet.</p><p>Out in the far reaches of space, five yellow rings fly together then split apart, searching for their new bearers. The caption says: \"To be continued this summer in Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special.\"</p>",

And on Oa, Lanterns clash as death stalks the Corps.</p> <p>Lanterns Vath Sarn and Isamot Kol find Guy Gardner standing over two dead bloody Lanterns. Guy tells them that one is still alive. When they ask him who did this to them, he says, \"Guy Gardner. He did it, He killed us.\" Then passes away.</p> <p>On Nibelos, Lanterns Natu and Iolande are on a mission when Iolande recieves a message that her father is dying. Natu gives her permission to go to him.</p> <p>Sarn, Kol, and Gardner try to figure out what happened with the dead Lanterns. Their ring logs have been wiped. The sector house entry and exit logs show that no one has arrived or left between them and Gardner. Sarn and Kol ask Gardner to go with them to Oa so they can straighten everything out. They also ask for his ring. Guy says they can have it but will have to take it from him. He takes off and puts the facility under emergency lockdown, locking Sarn and Kol inside. They have no choice but to contact Oa.</p> <p>On Betrassus, Iolande goes to her father's bedside. He tells her that with her brothers dead, she must give up the Lanterns to be be Queen and rule the planet. She says she cannot turn her back on her duties to the Corp. Natu arrives and asks if she can join the doctor and have a look at him.</p> <p>Guy goes to Mogo. Quond, one of the dead Lanterns, had gone to Mogo before he was killed. He asks Mogo if there was anything off about him. Mogo doesn't really offer too much help there but tells Guy that there is someone else he can talk to. Guy comes face to face with his father? His father seems largley out of proportion. He begins getting pushed around by his drunk father and asks Mogo to stop what he's doing.</p> <p>Back on Betrassus, Natu comes out saying Iolande's father passed. There was nothing they could do. Iolande is outraged saying Natu let her father die. The planet will now go into chaos with him dead. Natu is tired of being blamed for anything and leaves. She tells Iolande that this is her problem.</p> <p>On Oa, the Lanterns prepare to hunt down Guy. Kilowog says they need to track him down and execute him. There is no mercy for a Lantern that would murder another a brother Lantern. It is decided that Sarn and Kol will handle the case as it is theirs. Kilowog is not happy with sending two rookies to handle it. They will be assisted with Mogo's sector partner Lantern. A Lantern the size of an insect.</p>",

The dark force behind the Rogues' full frontal assault is revealed —and this issue's shocker ending will change the Flash forever!</p><p>In the police office, Bart Allen sheds his civilian identity and becomes The Flash in front of his superiors and friends. He doesn't have the time to stick around for their questions. In half a millisecond, Flash has made his way to the Getty Center where he Rogues are waiting behind a force field. On the way there he notices a black figure following him but he doesn't stop. He's fine as long as whoever it is doesn't get in his way.</p><p>Inside the Getty Center, the Rogues wait impatiently for Flash. Some even question if he'll show, but Inertia reminds them that he's from the future so he already knows that Flash will show.</p><p>Flash is on his way but he can't go throw the force field and he knows it. There's another way through, but it involves phasing through solid rock, something only a few people can do. Flash reveals that he knows everything that's going to happen thanks to his grandmother. She told him because she believed Flash could change the future.</p><p>In the Getty, Abra Kadabra questions Inertia on the machine he plans to use to stop time. Kadabra, being from the 64th century (while Inertia is only from the 30th), can tell that the machine won't do what Inertia claims it will. Inertia realizes he's busted and has Kadabra come take a walk with him.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the airport, Valerie Perez, Flash's girlfriend is about to leave town. She's telling herself that because of who Bart Allen is, a relationship is impossible. Before she gets to far, Iris Allen uses her future technology to materialize in front of her. She wants Valerie to help her stop something terrible from happening.</p><p>Back in the Getty, Inertia is beating on Abra Kadabra in super speed. He says that he expected Kadabra to be dumb and not notice what he was doing, that he was using the Rogues as base. Now that he had figured it out though, he had to get rid of him. Before he can, Flash arrives. As he starts fighting Inertia, the rest of the Rogues blow through a wall and attack. Flash has to put forth a little effort, but he's able to fight them all at once.</p><p>Outside the Getty (but still in the force field), Iris and Valerie appear and take a look at Inertia's device. The machine was actually built to steal the Speed Force from Flash, not stop time. Valerie doesn't know how to dismantle the machine, but she does discover that it's already started working.</p><p>While fighting all of his Rogues together, and traveling at 350 miles per hour, Flash loses the Speed Force. He trips, skids, rolls and bounces for a while before stopping. The Rogues gather around him, thinking that time has stopped for everyone but them, but flying helicopters tell them otherwise. They all get made and swear against Inertia. While they're all distracted, Flash looks up from his position on the ground and see the Black Flash, the grim reaper of speedsters, standing over him.</p><p>At the machine, Valerie tells Iris that the Speed Force is now in the machine, but that's only the beginning of the problems.

As the Amazon war reaches a climax, Wonder Woman begins a desperate search for a missing comrade whose fate is inextricably tied to the future of Special Agent Diana Prince!</i></p><p>At the Department of Meta-Human Affairs, Diana is being briefed on Everyman posing as Sarge Steel to keep people away from the real place that the real Steel Sarge was being imprisioned in. Everyman then snuck back here while the rest were busy dealing with man-beasts and nuclear missiles. However, the question that Diana Prince asks is, \"Where is Everyman now?\"</p><p>Meanwhile, in the medical bay, Nemesis feels he is ready for work, but the doctor insists that he stay for another 48 hours in case anything happens. However, Nemesis is not in the mood for arguing and makes the doctor take a nap and changes into the doctor's physical appearance, exiting the building.</p><p>In the control room, another agent reports on Circe, saying that is sitting on the throne in Themyscira and a visual of that on the large screen. Diana Prince realises that she's waiting for Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman makes her way to Themyscira when Nemesis tells her to wait up, as he would be happy to help her. As they enter, it turns out that Nemesis is Everyman and turns out he lured her into a trap, where he throws a grenade and runs off, but finds Circe in front of him.</p><p>Everyman realises that Circe had betrayed him and asks why she abandoned him and she replies that she will explain later. Everyman then asks about \"Plan B\" and then realises he is being tricked again. He changes his arms into Cheetah's claws and Circe dodges his attack and smiles – because Circe is actually Nemesis! Everyman turns into Silver Swan and files off, but Nemesis holds on and demands to know where Sarge Steel is. Everyman then turns into a gorilla and both of them fall into the water. Everyman turns into a mermaid and swims towards the cemetry. Nemesis makes it onto the other side and uses an abandoned motorcycle on the road to make his way to the cemetry.</p><p>At the cemetry, Nemesis chases down Everyman and demands that he reveal the location of Sarge Steel and Everyman indicates the Tomb of the Unknown Solder. Nemesis attempts to remove the grave and Everyman asks to help, but Nemesis trains his gun back onto Everyman. But it turns out that Everyman has a bomb detonator. Wonder Woman throws her tiara and knocks it out of his hand. Everyman goes for the detonator but Wonder Woman lassos him and lifts up the grave to find Sarge Steel under it.</p><p>Later with Everyman held in a prison cell, Sarge Steel addresses the staff and tells everyone that the headquarters should be up in 24 hours. After the debriefing, Diana Prince takes Nemesis aside and discusses how they are going to deal with the fact that how he knows who she really is and asks him to keep the Wonder Woman secret to himself. Bemused, he admits that he has a bit of a crush on Wonder Woman, but he says that it is the Amazon Princess who wants <em>him</em> and thinks that Diana Prince wants a relationship with him. However, Diana realises that Nemesis no longer remembers that she is Wonder Woman and her secret identity is safe once more.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>It's crisis time as Spider-Girl realizes that Carnage will only be stopped if she destroys someone she truly loves!</i></p><p>Spider-Girl finds herself face-to-face with the new Kid Carnage, otherwise known as her little brother. Carnage sits back, marveling in his brilliant idea to infect the youngest Parker. Inside, Moose, continues to try to fight Carnage. He mentions that it's wrong to let a child commit murder. Carnage agrees that they shouldn't let the child have all the fun and begins to attack Spider-Girl again. Moose lets out a warning which comes as a surprise to Spider-Girl. As she dodges the attack, her cell phone goes off. She can't answer the phone and isn't sure how to fight without hurting her little brother. Benjy has no qualms about hurting her and takes a chomp at her shoulder.</p><p>In Forest Hills, Peter is trying to call May after having escaped from Carnage. He wants her to know that Carnage is still on the loose. Mary Jane says that she may already know that.</p><p>Spider-Girl wraps her little brother in webbing and takes off. Carnage simply follows and they soon come across Agent Hill and her team. They begin to attack Spider-Girl while Carnage attacks them. Spider-Girl manages to save an agent who, in return, tries to arrest her. This is interupted by Kid Carnage, trying to attack her once again.</p><p>The fight continues. Kid Carnage gets knocked back and Spider-Girl jumps and saves him before he can smash into a wall. He thanks her by slashing at her arms. Carnage has taken out the others and Spider-Girl lies on a rooftop. As Carnage and Kid Carnage move in on her, she gets an idea to try to reach Moose. She tells him that the goverment has been researching Carnage for years. Carnage replies that they saw him as a bio-weapon. Spider-Girl says that there's also a chance that he could be a cure for cancer. Surprised, Moose tells Carnage that if they can go and help his dying father, he will give in completely to Carnage. Becoming one is what Carnage would love. He agrees.</p><p>Finally given a moment to catch her breath, Spider-Girl's cell phone goes off again. Peter asks her about Benjy. May doesn't exactly tell him the truth. She asks him to go into the police property room to get an item that will help. As Peter heads to the police station, Spider-Girl goes to the hospital.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kaine and Darkdevil crash a SHIELD safehouse with the rogue agents and the Contessa. She denies having any knowledge of Specimen 297. Kaine manages to help her see that all the other specimens need to be destroyed to save the U.S. embarrassment with the U.N. for having a deadly bio-weapon.</p><p>Carnage arrives at the hospital where Courtney and Moose's cousin are. Even though Carnage said he'd hold back on the violence, he shakes off the guards that come towards him. Seeing Courtney, he thinks how lovely it would be to have a taste of her. Spider-Girl arrives in time to prevent anything happening to Courtney. Next Peter arrives wearing the Reverb armor (from issue #2). The sonic blasts are the only thing that can stop Carnage. Seeing Kid Carnage, Peter can't use the armor out of fear of injuring Benjy. Kid Carnage simply leaps towards him and Spider-Girl has to push him out of the way. She grabs a gauntlet and uses it on her brother, hoping it will not injure him. Ben is left crying on the floor and blood is dripping out of his ears.</p><p>Carnage finds Moose's father. Moose tells him to do his thing to save his dad. Carnage asks how does he know that Moose will honor his agreement. Before there can be an answer, Spider-Girl blasts him in the back with a sonic wave. Moose is angered that Carnage has been destroyed before his father could be saved. He yells at Spider-Girl that she is no better than Carnage. Carnage was his only hope. He tells her he hates her.</p><p>A doctor checks out Benjy. He says he can't tell if the hearing loss will be permanent. Maria Hill calls Nick Fury and tells him that Specimen 297 has been destroyed. Nick says it's not too often that they get a happy ending. Spider-Girl walks off alone.</p>",
