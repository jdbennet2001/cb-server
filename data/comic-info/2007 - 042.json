            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em></p><p>Reed Richards’ attempts to create a Cosmic Cube have caused him to pierce the barriers of a hundred universes. And falling through the opening into our unsuspecting reality is the keeper of the Power Cosmic—Ultimate Silver Surfer! ’Nuff said! </p><p>After returning for a time traveling adventure, the Fantastic Four and the friends they had gone to save are being kept in quarantine for examination. Reed’s parents aren’t happy about this because one of the people now in quarantine was their daughter Enid. One of the doctors at the Baxter Building tries to calm them down but is over his head, so Reed bails him out. He explains to his parents that Enid was exposed to a strange energy and they had to keep her (and everyone else) separated from the outside world while they checked if she still had the energy inside her. Mr. Richards starts to yell and blame his son for what happened so Reed just walks away, obviously upset. The Invisible Woman sees him in the hall and tries to cheer him up, but he just wants to be alone and get to work. She eventually gets through to him and he lets her follow him to his lab where he’s still working on the cosmic cube. She asks why he’s not finished with it yet and he explains that it works, just not right. It needs a bigger power source, and to that end, he’s built a machine in order to “bottle a star.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the building, Enid is being treated by another doctor but is being uncooperative and refusing to let him sample her blood anymore. Nearby, The Thing, his mother, and some military men are playing cards and Mrs. Grimm is cleaning house. After getting beaten, one of the men asks Thing if his mom is seeing anyone. </p><p>Back in Reed’s lab, he lets Sue pick a star for him to take energy from. She picks one at random and Reed powers up the machine. It lights up and then starts to act strangely before exploding in a flash of light. </p><p>In another room, Johnny Storm is making out with his girlfriend but that ends when he kills the mood by shutting her down when she tries to talk about his feelings. </p><p>In China, scientists at a star observatory notice strange happenings in the night sky. Half the stars in the sky are dark, and something is casting a shadow over the moon. </p><p>At the Baxter Building, Reed has figured out what went wrong. Whatever it was that he had aimed his machine at, it wasn’t a star. </p><p>At a monitoring station in the Pacific Rim, workers detect a strange reading in New York but think that it won’t affect them. They’re proven wrong as an enormous tidal wave falls upon the station and the nearby city. </p><p>Fire falls from the sky in London, ash and smoke fill the air in Sydney, and lightning rains down over Kinshasa. The whole world is affected. </p><p>In New York, a storm appears out of nowhere and lightning stabs down from the sky. Thing notices that their building is taking more lightning that anywhere else right as the windows shatter and everyone is forced inside. </p><p>Reed and Sue are still in the lab and Sue is asking how the thing could not have been a star. Reed doesn’t explain what it is, just what is happening. The machine was built to pull power from a stars core, but the “star” had no gravity well, so instead of just pulling fusion power from it, the machine is pulling the entire “star” towards the building from hundreds of universes away. </p><p>Right as he finishes explaining this, a small beam of light smacks into the building and lodges itself in the wall. The light fades and all that’s left in a metal object stuck in the wall. Reed touches it and says that it must have energy on a stellar scale if the machine thought it was a star. While Reed works on his computer, Sue takes a look at the object and says that it looks like a surfboard. Reed blows her off and tells her what he’s found on his computer. He says that the energy signature of the “surfboard” isn’t off the scale, so that means that wasn’t what the machine hooked. It was something else, but it hasn’t arrived yet.</p>",

After the events of “Quest for Magik,” several of the kids have been changed forever, and the Astonishing X-Men are finally taking some time to get to know their students. But after everything the team has been through… who even wants to be an X-Man? New powers, new relationships, new team members, all on the road to the X-event of the decade! Part 1 (of 2)</i></p><p>Tired of dead ends with current mutants, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\" href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" slug=\"beast\">Beast</a> turns to the family that has sired the most mutants on Earth—the Guthries. The family that produced two X-MEN and may hold the key to save the mutant race.</p><p>This issue begins with a flashback to when the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\" href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" slug=\"xavier-institute-for-higher-learning\">Institute</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47984\" href=\"/matthew-risman/4005-47984/\" slug=\"matthew-risman\">Matthew Risman</a> shoots at <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40475\" href=\"/prodigy/4005-40475/\" slug=\"prodigy\">David</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-4443\" href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/4060-4443/\" slug=\"stepford-cuckoos\">Cuckoos</a>, but while sneeking around, his face is badly injured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4555\" href=\"/dust/4005-4555/\" slug=\"dust\">Dust</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\" href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" slug=\"surge\">Surge</a> cradles David as he's been shot, and Dust mutters \"Please forgive me.\"</p><p>Back in the present a <a data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\" href=\"/purifiers/4060-14915/\" slug=\"purifiers\">Purifier</a> asks Risman if he's okay, and after he replies affirmative, the Purifier tells him that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47143\" href=\"/predator-x/4005-47143/\" slug=\"predator-x\">Predator X</a> is alive, and it's hunting.</p><p>The Astonishing X-Men team discuss the New X-Men, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\" href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" slug=\"cyclops\">Cyclops</a> tellig the rest how well they've done since <a data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\" href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" slug=\"m-day\">M-Day</a>. Cyclops tells them that there are twenty-five students left at the Institue, an eigth of the mutant population. He says that they don't even know the kids, but that ends today.</p><p>Next, down in the Med Lab, Beast fixes Dust's dislocated shoulder, while <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40673\" href=\"/pixie/4005-40673/\" slug=\"pixie\">Pixie</a> tells them how she's a member of the New X-Men, how she can peform a spell and that <a data-ref-id=\"4005-66486\" href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-66486/\" slug=\"doctor-strange\">Dr. Strange</a> said that he'd teach her more when she's eighteen.

He refuses and Rockslide calls him a sissy. Anole is angered by this, and just then, Mercury appears, with a question...</p><p>Mercury goes to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4552\" href=\"/elixir/4005-4552/\" slug=\"elixir\">Elixir's</a> room, to ask him how old he is. But, he tells her how he can feel all cells aging and dying, but the question is can he stop it? She walks away to go ask David how old Elixir is.</p><p>Mercury knocks on <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\" href=\"/hellion/4005-40454/\" slug=\"hellion\">Hellion's</a> door, but suddenly the whole wall is blown back as is she. Turns out he was practicing using his TK, but he says that anything smaller than a fridge, and he can't deal with it. She asks them how old the Cuckoos are, and he replies they're really 2, and he asks why? She replies Matt Landru.</p><p>In Cerebra, the Cuckoos are scanning the world, while Mercury preceeds to tell them and Hellion that the youngest mutant is probably one of them. They decide to exclude <a data-ref-id=\"4005-48656\" href=\"/tito-bohusk/4005-48656/\" slug=\"tito-bohusk\">Tito</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1936\" href=\"/molly-hayes/4005-1936/\" slug=\"molly-hayes\">Molly Hayes</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\" href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" slug=\"franklin-richards\">Franklin Richards</a> and the Cuckoos from they're investigation. Then, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\" href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" slug=\"emma-frost\">Emma Frost</a> opens the door, telling Mercury and Hellion to come to her office for a student-teacher meeting.</p><p>Outside, Beast and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\" href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" slug=\"colossus\">Colossus</a> are waiting for Rockslide to arrive. Suddenly, Rockslide falls out of the sky above them, Anole pushing him down into the ground. Five minutes later, and Beast asks him to fire a limb, so that he'll explode and Beast can study him. He refuses at first, but when Anole calls him sissy,, he fires a limb and explodes. Beast thanks Anole, and both take shelter behind Colossus. Beast tells Rockslide that if he can hear him, try to feel the rocks and pull him together. He does so, and Beast says that he wants to see what'd happen if he reforms if he's smashed by someone else, and Anole fladly volenteers behind him</p><p>Surge goes around asking the students asking what happened to David in Limbo, and they all try to avoid it, but X-23 tells her what happened with excruciating detail.</p><p>She storms off while Pixie, flies behind her, telling her that she thinks that she and David are a cute couple. Cyclops and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\" href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" slug=\"wolverine\">Wolverine</a> show up, and Cyclops tells Surge that they need to talk, while Wolverine takes Pixie with him.</p><p>In Emma's office, she tries to talk to Mercury and Hellion, but they tell her that they think she's sad.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\" href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" slug=\"kitty-pryde\">Shadowcat</a> tries to have a meeting with Elixir, but he tells her that he's thinking, and when she asks what about, he tells her a bunch of mumbo about life and death.</p><p>As <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40640\" href=\"/wolf-cub/4005-40640/\" slug=\"wolf-cub\">Wolf Cub</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40672\" href=\"/loa/4005-40672/\" slug=\"loa\">Loa</a> ponder whose the youngest mutant while eating, Pixie flies past behind them, Wolverine in pursuit, cursing the unicorns that he's seeing via Pixie's dust.</p><p>Most of the students are gathered in one room, wondering who the youngest mutant is. At first, it is said to be Wolf Cub, but then Mercury realises that Indra's name isn't on the list, and then he's revealed the youngest mutant. Meanwhile, in the same room, David tries to get Surge's attention, but she keeps ignoring him. And then she jumps at Hellion, and kisses him. Everyone looks shocked, and X-23 sheathes her claws, while Rockslide tells Indra that he's dead....</p><p>Back to the Purifiers, and they've planted a burqa of Sooraya's tied between two trees, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47143\" href=\"/predator-x/4005-47143/\" slug=\"predator-x\">Predator X</a> eats it, making Dust it's new target.</p><p>At the Guthries, Beast and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3422\" href=\"/dark-beast/4005-3422/\" slug=\"dark-beast\">Dark Beast</a> arrive, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-45122\" href=\"/lucinda-guthrie/4005-45122/\" slug=\"lucinda-guthrie\">Lucinda</a> tells her kids to go and do they're homework. Beast preceeds to ask for a gene sample from her. Lewis, a son of Lucinda's goes outside, but is followed by Dark Beast. Dark Beast sees him acting as if he has super-powers, but Lewis tells him it's not a game, and tells him that he's waiting for his powers to kick in. Dark Beast tells him it ain't gonna happen, because of M-Day, but Lewis tries to remain optimistic. Dark Beast tells him it ain't gonna happen, unless he wants to try it from a different angle, offering him a small vile of liquid.</p><p>Back inside, Beast explains to Lucinda the situation, but she refuses to do it.</p><p>Back outsice, Dark Beast tells Lewis that he has to use his powers for good, and Lewis says he will, and he'll find his brother's killers and take them to jail. Lewis tells him that he's all for it, and Dark Beast tells him to role up his sleeve.</p><p>Inside, Lucinda tells Beast that she it's like waiting for her kids to be drafted into a war, and she continues to refuse. Beast tries to convince her , but then, one of the Guthrie girls come running in, telling her that Lewis is sick. They all run outside to see Dark Beast holding Lewis, Lewis's skin all pick and lumpy, with a pink fluid coming from his mouth.</p>",
