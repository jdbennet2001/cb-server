            "description": "<p><em>The world’s deadliest living weapon just fell into the wrong hands. It’s Wolverine vs. the Marvel Universe in a blockbuster storyline that will have Logan shredding his way through the X-Men, Avengers, Fantastic Four, and the S.H.I.E.L.D.</em></p><p>This issue opens and Wolverine is slaughtering S.H.I.E.L.D. troops aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft carrier in the South Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>A S.H.I.E.L.D. officer begs Elektra to help them and do something! She says not yet as she seems to be formulating a plan of action. Troops continue to die as Wolverine's inner turmoil is documented in thought boxes.</p><p>Finally, Elektra springs into action. She plunges her twin sais into Wolverine's deltoid muscles effectively paralyzing him. She tries to explain to Wolverine that he's been brainwashed by HYDRA. She says she can help him and asks him to blink twice if he's willing to cooperate. The HYDRA voice in his head remarks that they've been fighting for 115 seconds and plan B is about to kick in.</p><p>At that moment the aircraft carrier is rocked by a powerful explosion. They are both knocked clear of each other. Wolverine destroys her sais with one swift claw attack but she still is able to inflict a nasty neck wound on him. Logan remarks at how fast she is as she gets ready to finish him off.</p><p>A torrent of seawater fills up the lower levels of the ship and Wolverine is again free. More explosions rock the carrier as many of the S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers are swept thru gaping holes in the ship's hull. Elektra holds on for dear life as Wolverine attempts to drown her by sealing off the compartment of the ship she is in.</p><p>This allows Wolverine to make his escape as Elektra plots her own escape. As Wolverine swims to the surface he encounters a school of sharks seeking to prey on the crew members. He takes the time to gut one of them on his way to the surface.</p><p>Fifty minutes later and cleanup crews have reached the site. Elektra warns S.H.I.E.L.D. that their security has been hacked and they need to alert command. As she is taken into a helicopter she also remarks that \"SHIELD didn't find wolverine, Wolverine found them.\"</p><p>Twenty four hours later and the SHIELD Helicarrier is above the Manhattan skyline. SHIELD command with Nick Fury and Elektra are discussing the situation. One of the officers asks if there was any chance Wolverine drowned. Nick Fury dismisses this idea because Emma Frost has sensed Logan's location as the eastern seaboard of the United States. He says this confirms the Hand's participation and introduces his agents to Elektra.</p><p>Elektra briefs the group of officers on the tactics of the Hand. This includes killing superhumans and bringing them back to life as part of their death cult. She informs them that this has what has been done to Wolverine. Fury informs them that all of the superhumans on the Hand;s list have been targeted to become part of the same process. All superheroes &amp; metahumans have been put on high alert and all civilians have been evacuated from the Baxter Building. An agent tells the group the President is on his way into SHIELD custody and all non-essential personnel have been removed from the Pentagon. All superheroes are ordered to be briefed on the situation by Fury and anyone with a compromised identity has been assigned bodyguards.</p><p>The scene shifts to Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters. Kitty Pryde is comforting a group of students and telling them they will be fine. She tucks them into bed and phases across the hall to a room she is sharing with Storm.</p><p>Finally, the scene goes back to The Baxter Building in New York City. Two civilian workers are leaving the building. They discuss whether or not they will continue to receive pay during their period of evacuation. They also discuss the weirdness of being employed for the Fantastic Four. They remark that they \"keep a friggin orange monster\" upstairs and Reed curled up like a beach ball is freaky.</p><p>The two men leave the building and Wolverine enters completely cloaked and invisible. Upstairs, Ben Grimm activates the force field surrounding the building. Completely unaware that Wolverine is inside. Wolverine says that 90% of accidents happen at home and this issue comes to a close.</p>",
