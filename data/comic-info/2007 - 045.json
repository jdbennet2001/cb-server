            "description": "<p><em>Week 45, Day 3</em></p><p>In Kahndaq, the funeral for Isis and Osiris takes place. The Marvel family serve as pallbearers and try to some comfort to Black Adam. As they fly away, Renee Montoya looks on. She speaks with Black Adam. She wanted to see if there was anything she could do for him. Black Adam is surprised by this. She says she knows what it's like to lose someone, to feel guilt for surviving, and shame for not being able to prevent it. Outraged, Black Adam grabs her by the face and says she presumes too much as in a friendship that isn't there. Renee replies that Isis was her friend and he lets her go. He tells her to worry about her own problems with Intergang and to go home.</p><p><em>Day 4</em></p><p>In Bialya, the President speaks to Bruno Mannheim. He is concerned that the remaining Horseman, Death, has been given aid because Intergang has bought their support. He is also concerned that Black Adam will soon be there now that the funeral has ended. Manheim simply says, \"Nice Knowin' ya.\" Just then, Black Adam crashes through the window. Black Adam begins tearing his way through the soldiers.</p><p>Word soon gets to the Pentagon and then to the President. He orders the embassies in the surrounding countries to be closed. Alan Scott and Mr. Terrific know that something needs to be done to stop Black Adam, before the Bialya is completely wiped out. Amanda Waller tries to convince Atom Smasher to try to talk to Black Adam. He refuses to play any part of her plans.</p><p><em>Day 5</em></p><p>Black Adam continues his search for Death in Bialya.</p><p><em>Day 6</em></p><p>In China, the Super-Functionaries prepare to deal with Black Adam now that he has declared war on the world, in their eyes. They have spent months studying him. Finally with casualties in the millions, Death has grown stronger with the death of every man, woman, and child. He now decides to confront Black Adam. Black Adam tells him that he is no longer Death. Black Adam is now. He grabs Death and utters \"Shazam.\" A bolt of lightning strikes him. With Death weakened, he says it again. He tells what remains of Death that he will answer every single question he asks such as where he came from, then he is going to spend the rest of the night ending his life.</p><p><em>Day 7</em></p><p>On Oolong Island, the scientists are concerned that Black Adam will discover that they created the Horsemen. Dr. Sivana is overjoyed and says for Black Adam to \"Bring it on!\"</p>",

She tells him that <a href=\"/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">William Stryker</a> told her he would need here twice, once while he was alive and once after his death. He told her about a mutant antichrist after his death and asked her to kill it. She simply wants to fulfill her vow to him. Before she can strike at Cable, the new <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a> arrives and begins attacking the Reavers.</p><p>In the future, the Madrox dupe and Layla are brought inside the <a href=\"/mutant-containment-center-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/4020-56868/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56868\">Mutant Relocation Camp</a>.

Cable uses the battle as an opportunity to escape. <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> tries chasing after him only to be interrupted by Lady Deathstrike. She blathers on that he is now going to die because he chose to get involved in this. He dismisses her, saying he doesn't have time for her. He hands her over to <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a>. X-23 introduces herself with a pair of claws.</p><p>In New York, <a href=\"/predator-x/4005-47143/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47143\">Predator X</a> can sense more mutants are nearby...</p><p>At the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute</a>, the X-people are recovering from the <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinel</a> attack. <a href=\"/surge/4005-40509/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40509\">Surge</a> is being hard on herself for trying to attack the Purifiers. <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma</a> tells her that if they stayed at the mansion, they might have all died. She says the main thing is they survived. She tells her you survive an incident the first time and make sure it does not happen a second time. She also tells Surge that she was chosen to lead them because she would protect them from anything no matter what. Now it's time for her to that.</p><p>Scott is assembling more X-members to back up Wolverine when he gets the baby from Cable. They are to leave immediately.</p><p>Lady Deathstrike is not happy that Wolverine left her with a \"child\" to fight. She is insulted and is simply ripping away at Laura. She notices that she is not even fighting back. X-23 tells her that she was just listening and delivers a kick to the back of her shoulder. Lady Deathstrike tells her it was pathetic since she didn't even draw blood. She soon sees that the attack was on her cybernetics. She can no longer mover her right arm. Now X-23 will show her just what she can do.</p><p>Wolverine and <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Warpath</a> are still trying to chase after Cable. A Reaver gets Warpath in his sites and shoots at his back. <a href=\"/caliban/4005-9637/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\">Caliban</a> jumps in and takes three shots to the chest. Shocked and outraged, Warpath throws one of his blades right in the middle of the Reavers face. Wolverine yells at Warpath to stay on Cable but he goes to see how Caliban is doing.</p><p>Lady Deathstrike isn't doing so well either.
