            "description": "<p><i>The first story arc of the ongoing LADY DEATH monthly series comes to a shattering conclusion, with a controversial revelation that is sure to stun fans of the albino femme fatale! After being banished to Earth, Lady Death has risked life and limb to recover the lost fragments of the supernatural powers and memories which were stripped from her by the vile Death Queen, and her quest has led her to the frozen peaks of the Himalayas. To regain a lost fragment of the power crystal that will bring her one step closer to being whole, she'll have to fight the savage talons and razor-sharp fangs of the Ice Demons which have claimed the crystal as their own. But even as the aftermath of her struggle leads her to a most shocking and life-altering decision, an even greater shock lies in the Under Realm, when the true face of Death Queen is finally revealed, a truth that will forever change the course of Lady Death's life. Months of battles have taken their toll, but the true war for the Under Realm is about to begin! Co-written by Mike (Gravel, Wolfskin) Wolfer and original creator Brian Pulido, this series promises to be the most powerful Lady Death tale ever! Amazing new talent Marcelo Mueller provides the luscious art and Digikore brings the dramatic colors wrapped in a stunning new cover by Matt Martin! Also available with a Wraparound cover by Richard Ortiz and a special Art Deco Retailer Order Incentive by painter Michael Dipascale!</i></p>",

Exploring her new surroundings she encounters countless new friends, including another young feline named Cocchi. This new kitty comrade opens up a whole new world for our star. Prior to this encounter she had a mild awareness of what it was like to be a cat. To Chi, she was Chi and the Yamada's were her clan. But now with another one of her kind clearly there, she is more willing than ever to accept that a cat's world is one that she should be and will eventually be a part of. So while on a rare night excursion, our furry heroine reunites with an old friend and is introduced to a world where a whole community of cats of all shapes and sizes congregate in the twilight. This reunion with her mentor Blackie allows Chi to slowly move closer and closer to that long awaited reunion with her own cat family.

            "description": "<p><i>The phenomenal success of the CAPTAIN AMERICA comic book in 1941 spurred a trend towards flag-draped superheroes throughout the industry during the ealy days of World War II. It seems as if every comics outfit suddenly needed to have one, two, three; sometimes more of these red-white-and-blue characters to fill out there line. This volume of GAG Spotlight is a collection of the best &amp; most interesting among the off-brand, imitation Caps, sampled from a variety of long-defunct Golden Age publishers. Includes Fox Features’ pariotic heroes THE EAGLE, U.S. JONES and (reprinted for the first time at AC) V-MAN in “The Meeting That Death Attended”. Also, from the Harvey stable, CAPTAIN FREEDOM and the origin of THE SPRIT OF’76. COMMANDO YANK (“The Temple of the One-Eyed Yellow Idol”), MINUTE MAN (“Makes the Dictators Buy War Bonds”) and SPY SMASHER represent Fawcett’s flag-wavers, as do FLAG-MAN, MISS VICTORY and (in his first MOM appearance) THE RED CROSS from Holyoke Publications, YANK &amp; DOODLE (another first-timer) from Prize Comics, YANKEE DOODLE JONES from Chesler, and CAPTAIN COURAGEOUS in “Unholy Death”(debuting in this issue as a reprint character at AC ) from Ace. 14 full stories in all, shot directly from actual vintage comics as source material. 150 pages of state-of-the art black &amp; white reprints of the patriotic superheroes of the Golden Age. So many stars and stripes you’ll go blind from it!! Featured artists include Phil Bard, Ramona Patenaude, Pierce Rice, Arturo Cazeneuve, Jack Alderman, Charles Quinlan, Rudy Palais, John Giunta and Charles Sultan. Black &amp; white interiors with full color covers, saddle-stitched.</i></p>",

But with two Crossed clans locked in a battle to the death nearby the quickly-thinning band of survivors is running out of places to hide! Join us as David Lapham and artist Raulo (Capt Swing) Caceres descend into a story about the worst aspects of human behavior, a tale of unspeakable evils, violent assaults on both mind and body, and of longing for death and the sweet release it will bring. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed. Crossed: Psychopath #6 is available with a Regular cover by Jacen Burrows, a Wraparound cover by series artist Raulo Caceres, a Torture cover also by Caceres, and a special rare Red Crossed retailer incentive.</i></p>",

Sensing Oz's resultant inner turmoil, Uncle Oscar drags Oz and company on a \"mission\" to Lutwidge Academy, where Oz's little sister, Ada, is a student. But some carefree fun and tearful reunion ten years in the making is not all for which Oz must prepare himself: crimson-cloaked foes are lying in wait to torture him for answers about the events of a hundred years ago...</em></p>",

He says that he has lost his connection to the Green; the Parliament is crying out in fear. William is released from his entrapment and he grabs hold of Abby. He begins to wrap Abby in a cocoon when suddenly we see the grove of the Parliament of Trees being burnt to the ground by the man who infiltrated it. William explains that Abby and Alec have both refused their destiny.</p><p>William state that Abby is the true avatar for the Rot. Alec tries to free her but he is attacked by bird like creatures. He flees on the motorcycle and Abby is taken away to the Rot's kingdom. Alec returns to the swamp where he begs for the Parliament to transform him again but he arrives to late and the Parliament is too weak to do so. Suddenly Alec is ripped almost in half by a chainsaw.

Can Hawkman stop Craddock from using the power of the Orb to unleash hell on Earth?</i></p><p>Hawkman deduces the Gentleman Ghost is Jim Craddock, and the Gentleman Ghost confirms it. The Gentleman Ghost tells Hawkman he invited him here because the Nth metal drew him to the Mortis Orb. Then, he tells Hawkman he will take him to the orb, but Hawkman refuses, so the Gentleman Ghost sends more apparitions after him. Taking Digby, Hawkman escapes the building.</p><p>Landing on another rooftop, Hawkman asks Digby more question about how did he get the book. Digby replies that he bought the book from a Julius Gates, a dead man who was a suspected warlock. Gates lived in a mansion outside of the city with his blind wife. Suddenly, Digby falls off the ledge and Hawkman catches him, saying that they will go to the mansion together.</p><p>Meanwhile, Emma knocks on Carter's door, but Singh tells her Carter is not home. Emma and Singh introduce each other, and Emma asks Singh to tell Carter to call her. Singh agrees, and asks for Emma's number.</p><p>On Long Island, Hawkman and Digbya arrive at Gates's mansion. As they enter the ruined mansion, they encounter Gates's wife. At first, Gates's wife mistakes Hawkman for her husband, but she then realizes he is not Julius. The woman introduces herself as Abigail and apologizes for the mistake, saying that sometimes her husband comes to her. Hawkman, apologizing for entering Gates's house without permission, asks Abigail about the Mortis Orb. Abigail replies that Julius spent his life looking for it, and he was buried with it. He believed that the Orb would bring him back to Abigail, not as a ghost, but as a fully resurrected person. She tells him that Julius is buried at the Rosewood Cemetery. Hawkman and Digby then leave, and Abigail asks them to tell her husband that she will be with him soon.</p><p>Using his GPS, Digby locates the cemetery. Hawkman and Digby arrive at the cemetery and locate Gates's grave. As Hawkman digs up Gates's casket, he takes the orb. Suddenly, a group of resurrected corpses attacks Hawkman, wanting the orb. The zombies continue attacking, even when Hawkman cuts them down to pieces. Then, the Gentleman Ghost appears, saying that the warlock's spell rendered the orb inert years ago, but the Nth metal broke the spell, causing the orb to regain its power. The Gentleman Ghost takes the orb, saying that he will use it to trascend death and resurrect himself through the life-force of every man, woman and child nearby. Then, he disappears and the zombies attack Hawkman fall apart. Hawkman returns to the city to find the Gentleman Ghost, leaving Digby alone.</p><p>As Hawkman reaches New York City, he sees more zombies approaching, as they are being attracked to the orb's power.</p><p>Taylor Manning, a news reporter, conveys the news of the zombies attacking New York.</p><p><br /></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Recently, an onslaught of creatures has targeted Superman, nearly destroying Metropolis in the process. And now...Superman is helping them finish the job?! Guest-starring Supergirl!</i></p><p>As soon as the Superman duplicate drops Billy McCoy to his death, Supergirl manages to save him. After taking McCoy to safety, Supergirl is appalled at how his cousin would kill a human after saying that he considered himself a member of the human race. She just wanted to talk to him about the clone of his she encounted, but it looks like he has more to answer for. The duplicate adjusts his language to speak Kryptonian. He tells Supergirl that she was not supposed to come to Metropolis until the city’s conformation was furthered, and now she has forced him to act. He then blasts Supergirl with his heat vision. The helicopter crew records everything and Lois watches the events from her office, telling the helicopter crew to be careful. Supergirl and the Superman clone begin fighting across Metropolis, but the duplicate begins holding the advantage. Lois begs Superman to stop, and the duplicate suddenly complies, startling her. In space, the real Superman begins to recover and somehow, that is beginning to weaken the duplicate. Supergirl seizes the opportunity to fight back, while Superman discovers the link between him and the duplicate works both ways. Superman uses the link to access the duplicate’s memories and discovers that the duplicate’s existence started as nanotechnology created in the planet Jazuur. The nanotechnology was created to maintain Jazuur’s ecological, environmental, technical and anthropological balance. Later, Jazuur was attacked by the Collector of Worlds, who was interested in the technology. When the Collector stole Jazuur’s imperial city, the nanotechnology reconstructed it, along with the Jazuur themselves. The Collector of Worlds was interested in the nanotechnology because of its ability to reconstruct the city, believing it to be the secret to immortality and indestructibility. He wanted to incorporate it to his own biotechnical system. However, the Jazuur’s nanotechnology proved to be incompatible with the Collector’s own nanotechnology, so he destroyed the Jazuur’s imperial city. However, a small Jazuur nanite survived. Later, Superman entered the Collector’s ship and discovered the white armor that would become his new suit. As Superman finishes looking into the duplicate’s memories, he realizes why did the star charts could not trace where the aliens who attacked Metropolis came from: he brought the nanite that would become the Superman duplicate to Earth in the first place. The duplicate regains the advantage in his fight against Supergirl. Perry White, Izzy Izquierdo and Cat Grant watch everything from the Daily Planet and begin to think that maybe Billy McCoy was right to criticize Superman. Mayor Morrisroe is being evacuated from his office, and he begins to think that maybe he was wrong in believing in Superman. General Sam Lane prepares to send his K-Squadron against Superman, but first he makes a phone call to Lois, telling her about the air strike and that he is sending a private transport to evacuate her. Lois refuses, saying he is only going to endanger innocent lives, and ends the call. As Lois watches the news, the duplicate is about to deliver what is likely to be a final blow to Supergirl. However, the real Superman grabs the duplicate and holds him at midair, revealing to the people of Metropolis that the impostor is the one responsible for the alien attacks. The duplicate begins speaking in the strange language the other three aliens have been speaking, confirming Superman’s story. The military fighters approach to Metropolis, preparing to engage the duplicate, but Superman tells them not to, as their interference will only cause more destruction to the city. Superman takes the duplicate and flies away from the city. General Lane agrees to call off the attack. Meanwhile, Billy McCoy begins a new broadcast in which he apologizes to Superman for trying to find fault in his actions. Superman takes the duplicate to the Arctic, where the two begin fighting. Realizing that he must have taken the nanite to Earth five years ago, Superman tells the duplicate that he now understands what the duplicate is trying to do: since the nanites were created to establish and maintain a symbiotic partnership to Jazuur, the duplicate is trying to recreate that symbiotic relationship using Earth and Superman. When Superman used his heat vision to stop the tank full of terrorists, the nanites assimilated the power of his optic fire and merged with a host body to create the fire monster. Superman believes that the explosion onboard the Collector’s ship must have warped the nanites’s primary directive and analytical functions. That is why the nanites thought that a being of fire could meld with a city created in what they thought was Superman’s image, and that is why the nanites cannot except they are flawed. Superman also reveals that when he used his optic and auditory powers to save some people trapped in the subway station, the nanites assimilated those powers to create a monster that everyone, except him, could see or hear. He also reminds the duplicate about the time the nanites copied his cold breath when he put down a fire the nanites caused to destroy his first apartment building. The nanites also used a friend of Superman’s to create the ice monster. After finishing his statement, Superman tells the duplicate that all he has done is create a Superman that uses his powers to cause fear and hate. Saying that he never wants to see a Superman like that ever again, Superman destroys the duplicate. Then, Supergirl finds Superman and asks him to explain everything that has happened. Superman tells her he will do so in another time; for now, he wants to know about the clone she mentioned. Later, McCoy starts another broadcast in which he says that Superman threw the duplicate’s remains into the sun. In the hospital, Clark visits Heather Kelley, who is recovering from the nanites’s possession. Clark apologizes to Heather for putting her in danger, but Heather tells him not to worry, she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Heather tells Clark that she is not the girl meant for him and she is fine with that. She expresses hope that Clark will one day find the right girl for him. And as Clark and Heather talk, Lois stands outside the room.</p>",

And to sweeten the pot, they're by kicking it off by teaming Captain America and the Falcon with Spider-Man! Then, Cap takes a gig as a New York policeman to unravel the disappearance of the city's boys in blue. Lest we forget, there's no shortage of larger-than-life villains: from the Grey Gargoyle to Hydra to the Red Skull, there's plenty of opportunity for Cap to swing that shield! And speaking of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury's spy shop is here, along with Sharon Carter and femme force! Before it's over, you'll also see the debut of the Falcon's new duds and the first Cap story by Sal Buscema! Collecting Captain America (1968) #137-148.</i></p>",

The second daughter of Henry VIII, Elizabeth’s royal standing was called into question for a period of time following her mother’s execution. At the age of 25 she succeeded the throne after the death of her sister Mary I. Her appointment was warmly welcomed by her subjects. Under her reign, England defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, achieving a major advancement in the nation’s international standing. The country enjoyed great industrial, economic and cultural prosperity during Elizabeth’s rule, and the period is often considered a golden age. Elizabeth never married and was consequently known as the “Virgin Queen.”</i></p><p>Chapters Thirty-One to Thirty-Six.</p>",

Segar, arguably the funniest cartoonist to ever lay ink on paper, died at the age of 44, leaving less that a decade’s worth of strips featuring his immortal creation Popeye — so this sixth volume of Segar’s <b>Popeye</b> is in fact the final one, enabling collectors to add the last “E” to the P-O-P-E-Y-E spelled out on the spines of Fantagraphics’ smashing collection.</i></p><p><i>This final volume starts off in grand style with “Mystery Melody,” featuring the terrifying return of the shape-shifting Sea Hag. Olive Oyl, Wimpy, Poop- deck Pappy, the Jeep, the newly domesticated Goon, and Toar all appear in this four-month epic, as does Bolo, the latest in Segar’s cast of massive Popeye opponents.</i></p><p><i>Other stories include the melodramatic “A Sock for Susan’s Sake” (Popeye becomes the protector of a girl who lives on the streets), Popeye’s boxing duel with King Smacko, the return of <b>Thimble Theatre</b>’s original star Castor Oyl as a detective who solves the case of “Plastic Pan,” the Poopdeck Pappy yarn “Wild Oats” (culminating in a six-month prison sentence for the rambunctious oldster), “The Valley of the Goons” (in which Popeye is shocked to discover who the new leader of the Goons is), and the self-explanatory “King Swee’Pea.”</i></p><p><i>And that’s just the dailies! <b>Popeye Volume 6</b> also includes 62 splendid full-page full-color Sundays, featuring further adventures of Popeye and an epically surreal six-month interplanetary voyage for Sappo, the star of Popeye’s “top strip.” The supplementary features include two historical articles by Popeye expert Rick Marschall (one on Popeye’s translation to the world of licensing and merchandising, and one on Segar’s place in comics and pop culture history), an illustrated Segar-written biography of Popeye originally serialized in newspapers of the time, and more rare art and photos.</i></p>",

Boarding a ship from the port of Lenos (much to the chagrin of the wisewolf, who is none too fond of water!), the pair’s fate becomes entangled with that of a boy named Col, whose tale of his circumstances — combined with the gossip of the sailors — leads to a shocking revelation about Holo’s homeland!</em></p>",

Torn from the turbulent headlines of 1941 America, each tale crackles with the tension of a nation on the brink of war - and there's no doubt these heroes were ready to fight! And arriving on the scene to prove it is Jeffrey Mace, a.k.a. the Patriot, making his MARVEL MYSTERY debut! Of course, each 64-page issue is also jam-packed with the adventures of Ka-Zar, protecting his jungle domain from Nazi invaders; school-boy sleuth Terry Vance and his monkey compatriot, Dr. Watson, solving mind-boggling mysteries; other-dimensional hero the Vision, fighting the weirdest menaces imaginable; and the gritty Angel, battling evil from gangsters to ghosts!</em></p><p><em>Collects Marvel Mystery Comics #21-24.</em></p>",
