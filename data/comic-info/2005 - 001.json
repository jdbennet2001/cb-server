            "description": "<p><i>Discover the secret history of the Young Avengers when Jessica Jones and Kat Farrell investigate the kids' origins for a special issue of THE PULSE. Who were they and what were their lives like before they met Iron Lad? And what is the future of the team without him? Find out in the YOUNG AVENGERS SPECIAL #1.</i></p><p>Kat Farrell is fascinated by the Young Avengers. She wants to know exactly what happened and she's willing to go straight to Cassie to find out. Jessica finally concedes that she'll talk to the Young Avengers and see if they'll talk to Kat. She goes to each team member and chats to them about their pasts and what made them become heroes.</p><p>She just wanted to know what happened to her father. That's all. Skipping school, she went to Stark Tower and waited to see Tony Stark. Even when his assistant tried to convince her he was too busy to see her, she stayed. She just wanted to know.</p><p>Telling the assistant that she'd wait all day, Cassie is about ready to do just that when her mother shows up and insists she goes to school. Cassie shouts that she just wants to know what happened, how her father died. Her mother's boyfriend, a cop called Blake, turns up to take Cassie to school. To make matters worse, Tony has apparently found a window in his schedule and he can see her when he gets there.</p><p>Blake insists that Cassie is going to school, he throws her father's criminal record in her face, saying that he's just as much a hero even without super powers. Their argument becomes heated and she shoves him hard. She asks him if he's such a hero, why can't he do better than picking up truanting children. At that, her mother slaps her hard and Cassie storms out.</p><p>That night, Cassie packed a bag, intent on running away. But as she left the house, she caught a news broadcast about a new team, the first outing of the Young Avengers. She discovered she'd inherited her father's powers and she found a new family, a place to be a hero.</p><p>If she had runaway, she would have headed to Los Angeles to join the Runaways. But all she wanted was to know how her father died and to walk his path.</p><p>It was always obvious to him that he was different to everyone else at school. He could change his appearance to fit in, make himself look just like people expected him to. He joined the basketball team and soon became best friends with the team captain, Greg Norris. One day, he told Greg about his ability to change his shape.</p><p>Greg thought this was the coolest thing and convinced Teddy to use his powers so that they could both do anything they wanted. Teddy got them into premiers pretending to be Tony Stark. He signed autographs as Johnny Storm. He even made public appearances as the Hulk.</p><p>Then Iron Man declared that the Avengers were being disbanded and that Avengers Mansion would be made into a public landmark and memorial. Greg had the idea that they should go to the mansion and raid it for souvenirs but as it became increasingly clear that Greg was only after making quick cash, Teddy threatened him. He didn't want the memory of the Avengers desecrated. Greg called him a freak and ran off. Alone now, Teddy stared at a picture of the great team when Iron Lad approached him and recruited him for the Young Avengers.</p><p>Bullied for being different at school, Billy found his solace in sitting outside the Avenger's Mansion. On one of those times, he'd been beaten up by the biggest, meanest kid in school, name of John Kesler, when a woman in red sweats asks him if he's okay. He's not okay. He's angry and bleeding but when he looks up he realises it's the Scarlet Witch. In a fit of awe, he blurts out that she's his favourite Avenger.</p><p>They walk together for a while and she gives him the advice that everyone has gifts, even if they're not super powers, and they're all worthwhile. She tells him to stand his ground and he himself. Then she heals him with a touch and kisses his cheek before they part ways.</p><p>The next morning, Billy's walking through school. He knows he'd never be able to stand up for himself so he re-arranges his schedule to avoid Kesler as much as possible. But then he sees the bully picking on a smaller kid. Billy gets angry. He pushes in and just as he's about to get pummelled, it turns out that he does have power and he used them to stand up for the kid.</p><p>But that first time, he lost control and almost killed Kesler. He ran to the Avengers Mansion but they'd been disbanded and Scarlet Witch wasn't there to make it better any more. Iron Lad found him there and made him into Asgardian who later became Wiccan.</p><p>Kate's mother died a year ago. She spent her life trying to use the Bishop wealth to change the world. Kate was never entirely comfortable with how wealthy her family is and she tried to convince her sister that all the money she was spending on a flash wedding could be put to charity, to actually changing lives and helping people. Her sister retorted that if their mother hadn't spent her life running around trying to save the world then she'd still be alive.</p><p>Kate wanted to help though. She couldn't just be wealthy and let it lie. She started helping out at soup kitchens and helping the homeless. But one night on her way home from school, she was attacked in the woods. She realised that bad things happen, things that could destroy you if you let them.</p><p>She chose to learn from it. She threw herself into training, became an expert archer and marksman, worked on her fighting skills. Then when the Young Avengers tried to save her at her sister's wedding, she chose to join them.</p><p>Eli was never sure if his grandfather had really been the black Captain America. The old man had been so badly damaged that he couldn't speak and rarely stood up for himself. It shamed Eli to think that his grandfather wasn't really a hero.</p><p>One evening on the way home from the store, Eli and his grandfather were set upon by bullies. One of them threw a bottle at his grandfather, knocking him to the ground. Eli grabbed the bottle and was going to go after the kid when two lads stopped him. They asked him how he expected to take on a gang of bullies on his own when he didn't have any powers himself. They then sold him the mutant growth hormone.</p><p>Talking to his grandmother, Eli realised that it didn't matter if his grandfather had been Captain America. He was still a hero. So he asked to play ball in the yard. When his grandfather threw the ball too far, Eli ran off to catch it. The bullies were waiting. They started to beat him up but just as he reached for the pills his grandfather intervened. It was over before it started and suddenly Eli didn't want to take the pills because he was ashamed, he wanted to take them so he could be just like his grandfather, the black Captain America.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>He’s lost everything: his friends, his sister, and his cause. How far is he willing to go to get them back? </em></p><p><em>All he wanted was to make the world a perfect place for mutantkind. Pietro Maximoff was Quicksilver, the fastest living creature on Earth until the Scarlet Witch took it all away. Now the son of Magneto is despised, rejected, and alone. Down-and-out in Mutant Town where the few remaining mutants are fighting a desperate battle for survival. </em></p><p><em>And just when he thought things couldn't get any worse, along comes a Spider-Man.... </em></p><p><span><span>Run Down Apartment in NYC: </span></span></p><p>Pietro Maximoff lays in bed, sleeping in his underwear and dirty ragged shirt. He was the fastest living creature on the planet. He was so fast he was a blur to human eyes. Bullets could not touch him. He could run up the sides of buildings and snatch arrows out of the air. He was built for speed; running zero to sixty in seven seconds. His top speed was almost 220 miles per hour. His body adapted to withstand the accelerated impact of his feet hitting the ground thirty times per second.</p><p>As morning comes, Pietro, who hasn’t shaven in days, is bothered by a fly that buzzes right into his face. He curls up the newspaper, with an image of Purity activist William Stryker on its front, and tries to bat away the fly. Instead, he is too slow, and ends up knocking over his cup, spilling its contents. Pietro sits up in bed and looks down at the liquid on the floor, thinking. As the uninjured fly lands on the newspaper, Pietro gets up and, undresses so he can shower. When he is done, Pietro looks at himself in the mirror, and then proceeds to dress and pull out a bottle of liquor from his nightstand. The bottle is empty.</p><p>The man walks down to the store, and thinks to himself that his bones could absorb shocks that would shatter those of normal men. His tendons had the resilience of high tensile steel. His body metabolized food so efficiently that there was virtually no waste. He never carried an ounce of excess fat. He processes information at five times the speed of the average college student, as the data leaped from synapse to synapse. Today, it takes him much too long to read the nutrition facts on the back of a jar.</p><p>Pietro gets into the express checkout lane, but he is not as fast moving as he once was. Annoyed, a customer behind him tells Pietro to hurry up as he reaches into his pocket to pay. This is the express checkout, reminds the disgruntled customer. Like, for people in a <em>hurry</em>. Duh.</p><p>Pietro leaves the store, along with another bottle of liquor, without saying a word to the other man. Outside, he sees his bus speed by and runs after it. Once, he could have run across the surface of the water. However, this time Pietro slips and falls, spilling his groceries all over in the rain, as pedestrians hurry by and do not help him.</p><p>He was like the wind or a lightning bolt. He was superb; he was perfection; he was Quicksilver!</p><p><em>Avengers Tower: </em></p><p>Peter Parker stands in his Spider-Man costume, sans mask, and looks despondently out the window at the rain pouring outside. Peter, asks his wife Mary Jane as she walks into the room. Didn’t he hear her calling him? How long has be just been standing there? Peter does not respond, so Mary Jane tells him that they have to talk about this. Something is wrong.</p><p>Silently, Peter begins to put his mask on, so Mary Jane tells him not to do it. She can’t talk to him when he has the mask on. Peter puts it on anyway and turns to his wife, telling her that he is ok. He just has to go out. You are not ok, says Mary Jane firmly. I’m ok, reiterates Peter.</p><p>Spider-Man swings out of Avengers Tower and through the streets of the city. He doesn’t think Mary Jane would understand what he is feeling right now. For her, the world is as it always was, but for him it will never be the same. For a while he had everything he ever wanted in life. He had the woman he wanted – and it wasn’t her.</p><p>Spider-Man stops on a rooftop and looks at a high-rise deck, with a family enjoying time in the rain. Peter then thinks about his time in the House of M world, and his wife Gwen and his son Ritchie.</p><p>As the rain stops, Spider-Man gets up and takes off his mask. Tears begin to fall from his eyes as he mourns.</p><p><em>Pietro’s Apartment: </em></p><p>Pietro returns to his apartment drenched. How can they live like this? How can they stand to be human? Pietro takes off his long jacket and sits in bed with a drink and a photo of him, his sister, Hawkeye, Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. He and Wanda came so close to creating an almost perfect world. If it weren’t for a few imperfections that brought it all down, it would have worked. If they could start all over again he knows they’d get it right. However, now he doesn’t even know where Wanda is. She is gone and she has taken away his birthright. ‘No more mutants’ is what she said. She got it wrong again. There are mutants out there. Not too many though; not him.</p><p>Pietro takes out his uniform from his closet and puts it on. He pours another drink and looks out to the night sky. What has his perfect sister done to him? She was always the strong one. She told him never to give up hope. Where on Earth does he go from here?</p><p>Suddenly, Pietro gets up and stares long and hard at the full moon. He then puts down his shot glass and rummages through his things. It must be here. He knows he kept it. Finally, Pietro finds what he was looking for – a small bronze signaling device of design not reminiscent of any <em>human</em> architecture.</p><p>Quicksilver goes out onto the fire escape and activates the device. He then says out loud that, if she has any feelings left for him at all, she will answer. He looks back up at the moon and mutters that she must tell him that there is a place where he can be more than human again.</p><p>Suddenly, Pietro’s attention is called to the alley below, where three men are harassing another. One man, Bodie, tells Johnny to stay cool and he isn’t going to get hurt – if Johnny has been straight with Bodie and his crew. There is a whisper going around that Johnny is a mutant. I used to be, replies Johnny, but not anymore. Didn’t Bodie hear? Yeah, replies Bodie. They aren’t morons. They watch television. However, they hear that a few mutants have immunity or something. So they are going to check Johnny out. Their common friend, Sally – Johnny remembers Sally right? – well, she said there was something weird about Johnny. As the men begin to push Johnny around, he tells Bodie that he was drunk. Bodies feels something under Johnny’s shirt and begins to rip it off, but what the three men find underneath is not what they expected.</p><p>Johnny looks down at his chest and abdomen, which is covered in tentacles. More than that, a pair of red eyes stare back, as well as a mouth! Please, says Johnny, he cannot help it. The three men back away slowly, wondering what that thing is. Bodie comes close to touch it, but his friends tell him not to. At that moment, the creature on Johnny’s chest reaches out with its tentacles and grabs Bodie! One of the other men tells Johnny to let Bodie go, but Johnny explains that the creature has its own nervous system. It just reacts.</p><p>The men take out a blade, and chop off a tentacle, causing the creature to spasm and shriek in pain. Blood pours out of the creature, weakening Johnny, who falls back against a wall in pain. However, Bodie is released. As the men surround for the kill, Quicksilver comes down and tells them to leave Johnny alone.</p><p>Unimpressed, Bodie asks the man who he is supposed to be. I’ll give you a second chance to walk away, says Pietro. Neh, says Bodie. He will just punch Quicksilver instead. Pietro calls Bodie pathetic, but Bodie is much faster than Pietro and punches him square across the face! Pietro falls into some trash defeated, and the three men turn back to Johnny. It seems some radical surgery is called for.</p><p>Before Bodie can do anything, a web grabs the knife out of his hand. Spider-Man descends and tells the men, as he beats them up, that this is what he loves about the city. Every time he needs to hit someone really hard, some jerk steps up and volunteers. He can feel all the stress flowing right out of him. He has friends who swear by yoga Tibetan chanting, but the crunch of knuckles in a bad guy’s face always does it for him.</p><p>As Spider-Man beats up the men, Quicksilver quickly sneaks away.</p><p>Spider-Man turns to Johnny, who is in bad shape. Johnny is not sure how he is. He cannot feel the wound, and he thinks he is going to pass out. Spider-Man makes a tourniquet for the injured creature and tells Johnny that he is losing a lot of blood. Does he have a cell phone? Inside pocket, stammers the weak Johnny.</p><p>Spider-Man gets the phone and dials for an ambulance. Johnny, who can’t even keep his head up, mutters that they say less than one percent of mutants stayed mutants - one in a hundred; that is him. You convinced me, says Spider-Man when he gets off the phone, life sucks. The good news, though, is that help is on the way, so Johnny should sit tight and think happy thoughts. Spider-Man then looks up at the fire escape to see Quicksilver quietly skulk away, and tells Johnny that he thinks he just spotted another bad guy.</p><p>Spider-Man sneaks to the top of the roof before Pietro can get there, and then uses his webs to grab Pietro and pull him up. Before Quicksilver can say anything, Spider-Man holds the man by the collar and tells him that the last time Parker saw hi, Pietro was being crushed to a pulp by his dad. Peter cannot blame Magneto for that. Spider-Man then throws Quicksilver against the doorway from the room to the apartment, and demands to know why Pietro did it. Why did Quicksilver wreck his life?!</p><p>Angry, Quicksilver asks Spider-Man if he thinks he wanted this. Look at him! He is living like a fugitive. He has earned the hatred of his father. His sister is gone. He doesn’t even know if Wanda is alive. Pietro swings at Spider-Man, yelling that he has lost everything. Spider-Man sidesteps the blow easily. You see, asks Pietro, he has even lost his speed. Spider-Man cannot imagine what it is like to be so slow.</p><p>Spider-Man pushes Quicksilver up against the wall and laughs sarcastically in his face. He then pulls him to the roof’s edge to show him the ambulance takes Johnny away. What does Pietro think about Johnny? Does Pietro think that would have happened if he and his sister hadn’t screwed with the world? How about the thousands of lives destroyed – all the mutants who aren’t mutants anymore? How do they feel?</p><p>Spider-Man then lifts Pietro off the ground by his throat, and in a rage asks the former mutant about himself. He had a perfect little boy in a perfect world that Pietro and Wanda made. The woman he loved, who was dead, was alive again. They had a baby! He has lost his son!</p><p>Spider-Man lets Pietro go, and tells him that people say the worst thing that can happen to anyone is to bury your own child. However, Spider-Man feels that there is something worse. His son is dead, and Peter cannot bury him, because he never existed.</p><p>Spider-Man sits and holds his head. He cannot even tell his wife. This morning he is sitting there with all these memories swirling around. He is grieving for his dead son, and she is telling him a joke she heard on Letterman. Then she wonders why Peter isn’t laughing!</p><p>Pietro, who stands on the ledge, apologizes to Spider-Man. If he could do anything to make things right, he would. However, he cannot. Spider-Man, looking down at the roof, figures that makes Pietro a waste of space, doesn’t it? It does, says Pietro as he stares off into the night sky. Can Spider-Man think of a single reason why he should go on living? No, Pietro, says Spider-Man as he looks away, truthfully he cannot.</p><p>Spider-Man looks back – and Pietro is gone! Spider-Man quickly looks over the edge to see Quicksilver plummeting to the ground. Horrified, Spider-Man shoots a web, but it is not fast enough to stop the fall, and Pietro lands hard.</p><p>Spider-Man leaps down. He didn’t mean for Pietro to kill himself! As he bends down to check on the still man, there is a surge of energy, as two beings teleport into the alley. “Spider-Man?” asks the woman.</p><p>Spider-Man looks up to see Quicksilver’s estranged wife, Crystal of the Inhumans, and the beast known as Lockjaw, standing before him.</p><p>“What have you done to my husband?” demands a horrified Crystal.</p>",

Dr. Bruce Banner has been presumed dead since his execution, following his murderous rampage through Manhattan as the Hulk. But when reports start cropping up of an unidentified creature appearing around the globe, Nick Fury begins to get worried. Not because Banner can turn from man to unstoppable monster in seconds...but because Banner's existence is the one secret that can bring down Fury. Fury turns to the only man he can trust: Wolverine. And he's only too glad to take care of Banner-by any means necessary.</em></p> <p>This is the first issue of a re-make of Wolverine's first appearance.</p> <p>It starts off by showing us a badly wounded Wolverine and a very shocking 2nd page, then the writer decided to \"Tarantino\" it and show us Wolverine meeting Nick Fury, Betty Ross and Jennifer Walters, during this time Nick Fury asks Wolverine if he could \"take out\" the Hulk quickly and quietly, when Nick offers Wolverine something in return he simply replied \"You said he's tough, it'll be fun\"</p> <p>Then they jump ahead to Tibet 4 hours before we find Wolverine, he is in a bar drinking and then he asks a local why their are no girls in this \"town\", the man replied \"I...... no speak....... english\"</p> <p>Then they jump to 91 minutes before we find Wolverine and he is in his \"suit\" and is following a man with these yaks, he eventually tracks him back to a mountain, with a really big door on the front, the man enters, shortly after Wolverine opens the massive door and finds a quite content Hulk with dozens and dozens of beautiful women lying on and around him, everyone including the girls look up and the man that had opened the door only to find a calm Wolverine who un-sheathes his claws and says \"Hi Bruce\"</p>",

When two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, dabbled in this power to grant their dearest wish, one of them lost an arm and a leg... and the other became nothing but a soul locked into a body of living steel. Now Edward is an agent of the government, a slave of the military-alchemical complex, using his unique powers to obey orders... even to kill. Except his powers aren't unique. The world has been ravaged by the abuse of alchemy. And in pursuit of the ultimate treasure, the Philosopher's Stone, their enemies are even more ruthless than they are...</i></p><p>Edward and Al are introduced in their plight to find the Philosopher's Stone. It all started when Ed and Alphonse were children and attempted to bring back their dead mother with Alchemy, something considered the biggest of all sins in their world. The results of this were catastrophic for them and their friends and family, and their father, Hohenheim, had already left years before. After they attempted bringing Trisha Elric, their mother, back to life, Ed was taken to the \"Truth\", which decided that as compensation for such a sin, that he would take Ed's leg. Alphonse, however, was not so lucky. Truth took his whole body and placed somewhere else within the Gate. Ed saw that his brother, his only remaining Family member, was gone, and that he had also gained information about Alchemy no one would ever think about, being able to transmute without a circle, for one. After he saw Al disappear, he drew transmutation circles all over his body, one on his heart, on on his head, and one on his arm, telling himself that he would willingly lose these body parts if it meant that Al could get brought back to life. Luckily, Ed only lost his right arm, and was able to transmute his brothers soul, something else thought unthinkable, into a nearby suit of armor, thus saving his life and soul, if only temporarily. The first chapter starts with The two alchemist, the second is The price of life, the third is The Mining Town, and the fourth is the Battle on the train.</p><p>Within these chapters a lot is shown about how Ed and Al react to certain things, and characters are introduced and this volume hands out the meat and potatoes of what FMA really is all about. Ed'd character is deeper than most main characters of an anime or manga, and he is extremely emotional about certain things and or memories. At first he comes off as a snot nosed kid, and then shows that he is smarter and more capable than most people get out of him. A stereotypical character, at least, that is at first. His role as the older brother is challenged a lot by the trials he faces in everyday life, and it scares him. Thoguh he may seem like a stereotypical character for a manga series, Ed shows that he actually has real emotions in the course of Fullmetal Alchemist volume I.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 1: The Two Alchemists</li><li>Chapter 2: The Price of Life</li><li>Chapter 3: The Mining Town</li><li>Chapter 4: Battle on the Train</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><em>Overview</em> For more than ten years, pop culture cultists have revered and adored a mysterious, brooding thirteen-year-old girl named Emily the Strange. Nobody knows much about the young girl with a porcelain face and huge eyes framed by black bangs, and her ever-present brood of black cats only adds to the intrigue--but that hasn't stopped a generation of rabid fans from letting Emily put her spell upon them. Now, for the first time ever, Emily fans will be welcomed into her dark and, well, <em>strange</em> world--a place where kitty friends talk, the ghosts of famous weirdos come out to play, reality is never quite what it seems, and--above all--a place where anyone who's ever been considered a little \"strange\" themselves will be made to feel right at home.</p><p>Dark Horse Comics and the creative minds behind Cosmic Debris are thrilled to present the first-ever Emily comic books, published as deluxe single issues with all-new stories and art. Each issue of <em>Emily</em> comics features 48 pages of black, white, and red art (with the occasional outburst of full-color freakouts!), illustrating a wacky range of Emily stories.</p><p>Make sure to check out Emily's exclusive interview with punk rock legends, <strong><em>The Damned</em></strong>! And we're sure you'll get stuck on the 2 pages of special <strong><em>Emily stickers</em></strong> included in the back of the comic!</p>",

Writer Steve Englehart and artists Marshall Rogers &amp; Terry Austin set a high standard with their acclaimed run on DETECTIVE COMICS in the late 1970s! Now that team is back with BATMAN: DARK DETECTIVE, a miniseries that pits the Dark Knight against the most famous and feared members of his Rogues Gallery! In the startling debut issue, the Joker enters a gubernatorial election using the campain slogan \"Vote for me or I'll kill you!\" Will it persuade voters? Plus, Bruce Wayne's old love interest Silver St. Cloud returns, as do Two-Face and the Scarecrow! And the action continues in the startling second issue, as the Scarecrow manages to overcome Batman in the one location where he's most vulnerable: the Batcave! Meanwhile, the Bruce Wayne/Silver St. Cloud relationship heats up! Issue #1.</em></p><p>Batman checked out the security before attending a function as Bruce Wayne. Senator Evan Gregory was a man running for governor - Batman wanted to make sure he lived to see election day. Gregory wanted to make the Batman more \"legitimate.\" While speaking, Gregory introduced his fiancee - Silver St. Cloud. After an awkward moment, Silver introduced Bruce to Evan.</p><p>The Joker appeared and made his bid for governor - \"vote for me, or I'll kill you.\" He shook hands with Gregory and almost killed him with a rigged joy buzzer. Joker then demanded $1 million from everyone in attendance. Batman was quick to the punch, but Joker escaped cleanly. A police officer was found dead outside.</p><p>Note: Cover is a homage to the recruitment poster sporting Uncle Sam saying: I want you for U.S.Army</p>",

She is thought by her aunt to have some sort of mental illness, as Dinah believes the house to be haunted. Only Dinah is aware of the restless spirits, which only feeds the doctor's and her aunt's suspicions about Dinah's well-being. The house was a mental hospital, then a school for juvenile delinquents. The ghosts know Dinah can see them and they won't leave her alone. A recluse, she sneaks out with her only friend, Vincent, and together they discover a lost graveyard. There they find a sunken mausoleum, where Dinah reads from a stone engraving. This act binds her to a contract requiring Dinah to release spirits stuck somewhere between an unhappy life and a peaceful afterlife. If she refuses, she will face an eternity of hell. So Dinah begins her quest of \"cleaning\" the vaults, crypts and graves of lost souls, all the while struggling with the haunts at home and suspicions of her growing mental illness.</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 01: \"The Sickness\"</li><li>Chapter 02: \"The Gilded Cage\"</li><li>Chapter 03: \"The Stranglehold\"</li><li>Chapter 04: \"The Coming Storm\"</li><li>Chapter 05: \"The Fairywaters\"</li><li>Chapter 06: \"The Wild Beast\"</li><li>Chapter 07: \"The Angel in Disguise\"</li></ul>",

These beasts of the night allied themselves with factions of mortal men who aimed at shaking the foundations of the Catholic Church and freeing society from its strangling grip. But always were their true natures hidden, often even from even each other. The world was unable and unwilling to accept the existence of extra-mortal beings. A Midnight Opera is the story of two undead brothers Ein and Leroux DeLaLune, who are divided in this epic struggle and who are forced to reconcile their differences in the modern day to stop an open assault on mankind by the dissatisfied elements among the rest of the undead.<br /><br />Volume 1 focuses on Ein, who fled his brethren in the early 19th century only to surface early in the 21st century as an underground goth metal sensation. But with his newfound fame comes the exposure that brings all the demons from his past. And the Ein who wanted simply to pursue a life of music and love will find that he may have no other choice but to forsake both and assume the weight of all salvation on his shoulders.</i>",

            "description": "<p><i>For years, Tim Kreider's cartoons (as collected in 2004's <b>The Pain: When Will It End?</b>) were single-panel non-sequiturs in the tradition of B. Kliban, about the squalor and ridiculousness of the human condition. But after the takeover by the Bush-Cheney regime and the War on Terror, he focused his bitter humor on more timely issues. His political cartoons have been, in the words of Ted Rall (not known as a sentimental softie), \"among the most viscerally anti-Bush work around.\" As reality has become ever more nightmarish, Kreider's been driven to push the outer limits of humor to parody it. In this collection you will find: The Girls of Hamas calendar, the artist's conception of \"Negropolis\" (Strom Thurmond's proposal for a lunar colony for the repatriation of African-Americans), John Ashcroft imagining eating Donald Rumsfeld as their bunker crumbles around them, and U.S. jets bombing the Great Pyramids in the War on Horror. Cynical, astute, blackly hilarious, and deeply biased, these cartoons are neither the superficial, obvious jibes that appear in your daily paper's editorial section nor the didactic left-wing rants syndicated in your local alternative weekly; they are the artistic equivalent of hollow-point bullets fired from a high-powered rifle with a laser sight directly into the brain of the Bush administration. With an introduction by Mark Crispin Miller, author of <b>The Bush Dyslexicon</b> and <b>Cruel and Unusual</b>.</i></p>",

Introduced in the first Hellboy book and featured prominently in the film, Abe Sapien has remained one of the most intriguing mysteries of Mignola's celebrated work. The recent Hellboy film steered clear of any origin story for Abe so that the tale could be told in Plague of Frogs. The story of Abe's origins unfolds as the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense try to stop the monstrous frog men from the first Hellboy graphic novel, Seed of Destruction. The plague begins its spread across America, lending an apocalyptic new direction to Mignola's stories. Collecting the five-issue miniseries.</i></p>",

But when the council rebukes his plans for vengeance, Kybo decides to take matters in his own hands. Seeking out others who feel the same as himself, he sets out to stop the Separatist killing machine before more Jedi lives are lost. Meanwhile, Grievous hijacks a transport ship, and its precious cargo may give him a horrible advantage over the Jedi that they would never expect.

This volume collects the entirety of Windsor-Smith's \"The Freebooter\" stories from the acclaimed BWS: Storyteller comic book series from the early 1990s, including a full-length chapter from the unpublished tenth issue, plus more than 50 pages of new story. The Freebooters is amongst the most raucous and literate comics of Windsor-Smith's career, the culmination of a lifetime of experience and knowledge, approaching his comics with a seriousness of purpose while never losing his unmistakable sense of humor.

The arrival of a strange yet familiar fog reveals that the curse has found them, but even they don't know what that has to do with a pyromaniac refugee from the Civil War, the disappearance of one of their sons, or the terrible change coming over the Americans in this small seaside town.</em></p><p><em>With a cover by <strong>Hellboy</strong> creator Mike Mignola and haunting art by Todd Herman (<strong>The Dark Horse Book of the Dead</strong>) and Dave Stewart (<strong>Conan</strong>, <strong>Hellboy</strong>), this original graphic novel is an essential intro to the new film.</em></p>",

Come all . . . to the exciting world of Big Top! Rob Harrell's three-ring comic strip has already packed the house with fans eager for his hilarious take on the circus and those who bring it to life. The circus and its colorful cast-led by 10-year-old Pete and his happily reformed performing bear, Wink-are a perfect metaphor for life. It's not always what happens on the surface, Big Top reminds us, but what takes place backstage that delivers the lessons and the humor. Pete and Wink keep plenty of odd company, including Kingston, coolest king of the jungle; Stucco, a mute clown who still manages to make his point; Manfred, the bookish monkey; Dusty, the wisecracking tell-it-like-it-is trained poodle; Andrea, the new acrobat girl who's caught Pete's eye; and Hairy Mary the Bearded Lady, a mother figure to them all. Take this crew on the road and you get an endless array of situations and relationships, care and impatience, honesty and intolerance. It's like one big Big Top family . . . one that welcomes all readers for the mere price of a ticket.</em></p>",

Brutally honest but still evenhanded, Candorville takes on some of society's toughest issues, giving readers something to think about--as well as smirks, chuckles, and guffaws. Another Stereotype Bites the Dust is a collection of creator Darrin Bell's Candorville cartoon strip. In this thought-provoking strip Bell uses a diverse group of friends to paint a real yet humorous portrait of inner-city America. An educated underachiever, Lemont Brown is an aspiring writer. Socially conscious, he wants to work at changing the world and infusing it with wisdom and justice--if only he could pay his rent. Lemont's childhood friend Susan Garcia is a book-smart and street savvy Mexican-American woman who won't let bigotry or any glass ceiling keep her down. And Lemont's friend Clyde (aka C-Dog) is a streetwise thug and undiscovered rapper who'd rather mooch off his mother than get a job. Another Stereotype Bites the Dust deals with some tough issues--poverty, homelessness, racism, and personal responsibility--with knowing irony and incisive satire. Bell uses edgy dialogue and modern situations to jab everything from political correctness to political spinning, from political hindsight to office politics, making it a hit with the socially aware.</em></p>",

It's been a decade since political cartoonist Tom Toles collected his panels in book form. He's had a busy decade and plenty of time to further sharpen both his wit, commentary, and pen. NOW Who Do We Blame? presents an editorial master at the top of his game, in all of his whimsical, sometimes scathing, and always insightful glory. Toles, editorial cartoonist for the Washington Post, includes his favorite frames from the past. His subjects include the 9/11 Commission, the 2004 presidential election, terrorism, the Middle East conflict, Yasser Arafat, Afghanistan, Iraq, and of course George W. Bush. The collection title, in fact, comes from a panel showing Bush at his desk, covered with miniatures of the GOP White House, GOP Senate, GOP House, and GOP Supreme Court. Now who do we blame? asks the puzzled Commander in Chief. Such is the humor, satire, and intelligence of one of the most accomplished and widely read political cartoonists working today. Toles, who draws himself as the artist working in the lower right corner of his panels, takes on every issue and every powerbroker that crosses the national screen.</em></p>",

Especially if you're a dog. Pooch Cafe is the home away from home for Poncho and his canine buddies. No Collar, No Service marks the second collection of the hip hit strip Pooch Cafe, named for the place where Poncho, Boomer, and the rest of their pals regularly gather to discuss life among the humans and to hatch their plans to catapult all the world's cats into space. But you won't find this spot on Main Street. Its actual location is a canine secret compromised just once when they tried to get a pizza delivered. Poncho is as passionate about his love for his master, Chazz, as he is about his distaste for kitties. When Poncho and Chazz move in with Carmen and her medley of cats, Poncho pals up with \"Fish,\" a goldfish who conveniently speaks dog, to learn the lay of the land. Poncho views his master's new life as a threat to the sacred man-dog bond, despite Carmen's efforts to make peace with Poncho using love, tenderness, and cheese. Good thing there's always the gang at the cafe. No Collar, No Service is the saga of a strip that captures the intensity of the human-dog bond in a way that resonates with pet lovers everywhere.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>From the creator of UPN's <strong>Haunted</strong> and the Sci-Fi network original series <strong>Eureka</strong> comes one of the most ambitious and horrifying tales ever committed to the comics page!</em></p><p><em>Writer Andrew Cosby has imagined a United States shut off from the world by concrete barricades and barbed wire—not because of what might get in, but what might get out. A vampire plague has spread from sea to shining sea and when a small holdout of scientists trapped outside of Buffalo, N.Y. discover a cure, it's up to a Special Ops team from the President's current offices in London to go in and get it. Yet, not everyone in the world wants to see America back in the saddle again ...</em></p><p><em>The stunning painted artwork of Eisner Award-nominee J. Alexander (<strong>Queen and Country</strong>) earned the first issue of <strong>Damn Nation</strong> the honor of Cover of the Month by <strong>Wizard</strong> Magazine. With Alexander's atmospheric visuals, Cosby crafts a vampire thriller with surprises under every manhole cover and the dark truth that not all monsters fear the sunlight.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The cult classic is back in print! Sam Henderson's 1996 collection of his early mini-comics is available once again with this digital release. See what his work liked like back when he was poor(er). Introduction by Mark Martin. \"There are something like 50-60 strips here, with the longest being seven or eight pages. The brevity suits Henderson and his style of savage, biting, sarcastic humor. Henderson realizes the subject matter often doesn't merit more than one brutal kick-in-the-ass punchline. Some of the best sections feature several one-panel comics on a single page or two-page spread. This isn't moronic humor; Henderson knows what he's doing and some of the more satisfying bits of this book are those strips where he pulls apart and analyzes the humor involved or simply acknowledges a strip's abrupt vapidity. Better critics than myself have been screaming about Henderson for years, including a number of recommendations right here. With this attractive, meaty tome, you no longer have an excuse to ignore them.\" ~Tom Spurgeon, The Comics Journal Sam Henderson's Magic Whistle comic has been nominated for the last 4 years in a row for a Harvey Award for Special Award for Humor. One of the funniest people in comics is Sam Henderson. Henderson's drawing is intentionally crude, but it has the same kind of energy you see in the work of today's best gag cartoonists, whose drawing also tends to be a little basic. Extremely low-brow humor that almost parodies low-brow humor -- it's enjoyable on either level. Over the years Sam has done work for many dozens of anthologies, has done a self-syndicated comic strip and published comic Magic Whistle, now through Alternative Comics. Sam was also recently a writer of a number of Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon shows.</em></p>",

To remedy the situation, he promises his daughter's hand in marriage to a businessman named Alexander. However, this is not just an engagement, it's also a business deal. The purpose of this marriage is for a male heir. If one is born, then Alexander must deliver the boy to Mia's father, and in exchange Alexander will receive an entire island in the Aegean Sea. This arrangement that so resembles slavery makes Alexander angry, and the fact that Mia does exactly as her father says has him looking on both her and her father with disgust. Mia, however despicable the situation, complies with her father's wishes...</em></p>",

Demons! exploded the comic book medium, ending up on “Best Of” lists from Time Magazine and the Chicago Tribune. In these seventeen vignettes that touch on the scent of people's homes, why babies are the best dancers, and how pretentious exboyfriends are like head lice, Barry brings her demons out to be exorcised. Described as “brutally honest, thoughtful and soulful” by Nick Hornby in the New York Times, One! Hundred! Demons! takes on Barry's childhood with humor and poignancy.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>This is a true story about the most interesting person you've never heard of: Arthur Cravan, major figure in pre-WWI cutting-edge art circles, was among the greatest mysterious figures of the Twentieth Century. A self-confessed thief, forger, and con-artist, he used a roster of assumed names and false identities. He was known, at various times, as a novelist, poet, painter, art critic, lecturer, publisher, and the lightweight boxing champion of France. Always a rebellious, restless spirit, this dedicated rule-breaker was a political radical whose friendship with Leon Trotsky earned him the surveillance of the U.S. government-even through his immigration to Mexico with his wife, the poet Mina Loy. In 1918, at the age of thirty-one, the fascinating physical giant vanished without a trace, and-despite several supposed sightings over the years-was never seen again. Is it possible that he became the mysterious, reclusive novelist B. Traven, who wrote <strong>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</strong>?</em></p>",
