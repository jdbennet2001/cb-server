            "description": "<p><em>X-MEN: RELOAD ANOTHER CLIP! Jamie Madrox, stabbed, staggering off a bus. Jamie Madrox, setting up a detective agency in the heart of Mutant Town. Jamie Madrox, a peaceful Shaolin priest. Which is the real Jamie Madrox?</em></p><p><u><strong>Issue Summary</strong></u></p><p>It is night in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\" href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\">New York City</a>. The street is crowded with vehicles of every type, driving to their destinations under the illumination of their headlights, streetlights and the crescent moon above them. On the sidewalk, walking along it or using it to enter or exit any of the buildings lining the street, are throngs of people. One man among these throngs is a sweating, pale-faced young man, his right hand holding a wound under a bloodstained shirt, half hidden beneath his leather coat.</p><p>Walking among this sea of strangers, he thinks about this song, “Another Hundred People,” about people pouring into New York City by hundreds, into an ever-increasing faceless mass. It’s from a show called “Company.” And, if there’s anything he, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7910\" href=\"/madrox/4005-7910/\">Jamie Madrox</a> – the Multiple Man, knows, it’s company.</p><p>Half-doubled over from his wound, Madrox makes his way to a cab, which another pedestrian has hailed. Despite the man being in mid-sentence to the driver about going to Lincoln Center, Jamie knocks him aside, entering the cab without a word. When the man protests, Madrox simply pushes him back, again without a word. Incredulous at being manhandled, the man beings to protest again, until he noticed a red handprint on his white shirt. As he stares down in disbelief, he finally receives an articulation from Madrox, who simply instructs him to close the door of the cab. When the dumbfounded man asks Madrox if it’s blood, he replies with a repeat of his order. <em>Close the door</em>. Then asked by the man if it’s <em>his</em> blood, Madrox sarcastically replies that it won’t be for much longer, then repeats his order for him to close the door, to which the man complies.</p><p>Now turning his attention to the cab driver, Madrox speaks the name of his destination. <em>Mutant Town</em>. Rather than acting on this, the driver replies with a “what,” causing Madrox to repeat his destination. As the driver begins to ask a new question, the irritated Madrox leans forward, asking if he has to say everything three times. Having been able to see what he suspected, that his fare is bleeding, <em>in his cab</em>, the driver grows angry, asking Madrox if he has ANY idea of the paperwork… If he dies, Madrox asks. Receiving an affirmative, Madrox asks for clarification: <em>Die in your cab</em>, he means. Exactly, the driver exclaims. To this, he suggests that he let him take him to the hospital…</p><p>Nipping this idea in the bud, Madrox informs the driver that it’s too late for that… so how about he take him to Mutant Town… and then he just has a fare… instead of a murder scene on wheels. When the driver points out that he could die en route, Madrox counters that so could the driver. If he gets his meaning. Declaring that he does, loud and clear, the driver speeds off. His immediate problem solved, Madrox takes a moment to once again ponder the city of New York, the Great Melting Pot. What a crock, he thinks. Get it? he thinks to himself.</p><p>Continuing, he ponders how there’s no real “melting.” Assorted groups cluster in different areas for mutual support and protection. There’s Chinatown… Little Italy… Christopher Street… and then there’s “<a data-ref-id=\"4020-42359\" href=\"/mutant-town/4020-42359/\">Mutant Town</a>.” Difference is, they don’t get tourists… unless they’re looking for trouble… or are just dumb. Or both.</p><p>On a dark street in Mutant Town, two youths sit on the steps to their building. After a redheaded young woman walks by, one of them whistles out. Gaining no response, the two begin to follow, the first calling out to her. The redhead pauses briefly, glancing out of her peripheral vision. Grinning devilishly, the first asks her to slow down and give them a kiss. She’s not mad, he asks. Hasn’t she ever heard a wolf whistle? Stating that, <em>aye</em>, she has, the redhead spins around. Now no longer a girl, she is a werewolf. Baring her fangs and claws and spitting saliva, she asks in a Scottish brogue, <em>Have ye</em>? As the two stare in disbelief, Rahne Sinclair aka <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4557\" href=\"/wolfsbane/4005-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>, asks the two of them to give her a kiss. Moments after the two turn tail and run, Rahne returns to her normal form and sighs. <em>Americans</em>.</p><p>Continuing on her way, Rahne approaches a lone, four-story building and enters it. Climbing up the stairs, she arrives on the floor in question and heads toward a nearby door. Calling out to Jamie, Rahne lets slip her Scottish brogue – temporarily eliminating her carefully crafted American accent, as a result of her annoyance at her situation. Having received no reply, Rahne comes upon the door, finding a hand-written sign taped to its window: <em>XXX Investigators</em>, followed by <em>J. Madrox, Pres.</em>. Not bothering to knock, Rahne twists the doorknob, announcing her entrance with the advice to Jamie that he might want to splurge on a professional stencil on the… Rahne’s words trail, as her view into the office reveals the collapsed and sweaty form of Jamie Madrox, his eyes rolled back into his head and drool dripping from his mouth.</p><p>Quickly bending to her former teammate and cradling his head, Rahne calls out to him, demanding to know who did this to him and swearing that they’ll pay for… Suddenly, Jamie regains consciousness and promptly thanks Rahne for coming; he knows how busy she is… teaching up at the school. Still concerned, Rahne asks Jamie if he’s all right. To this, Jamie smiles goofily, replying that he’s fine… feeling noooo pain… In a moment of clarity of the situation, Rahne rhetorically asks Jamie if he’s drunk. Jamie’s response – kinda, yeah – causes Rahne to drop his head, allowing it to violently impact on the unforgiving linoleum floor.</p><p>As is his lot – from his mutant power – the impact causes Jamie to spontaneously generate a duplicate of himself, exact in every form, including his clothes. In a way, he thinks, he is his own parade. His own best friend. And the only drunk who can legitimately see double. As the two Jamies begin to gather their senses, Rahne walks to the kitchen, taking off her coat, and announces that she’ll be making him some coffee. Upon her initial inspection of his kitchen, Rahne quantifies that she will, presuming that this swill counts as coffee. It looks like somethin’ the witches of Endor would’ve brewed, she opines – then suggests that they should scan it with Cerebra. Mutant lifeforms might be growing in it.</p><p>Still sitting on the floor, the Jamies begin to re-merge with each other, one pushing the other into his body – disappearing into him as if he were being immersed into a pool of water. Still sweating, the remaining Jamie asks Rahne to give him a break, okay? It’s not like he drank himself into a stupor. Did she smell any booze on him? Thinking about this, Rahne admits that she did not, now that he mentions it. Rising to his feet and pulling out a drawer from his desk, Jamie replies that, yeah, last night he waffled on staying in or going out, so he sent a dupe out to have a good time for him.</p><p>Taking this in, Rahne repeats <em>last night</em>, and asks if he was gone for… Twenty-four hours, Jamie replies. Yeah, apparently he had <em>too good</em> a time. Ripping open a moist towelette that he found in the desk, Jamie begins to wipe his forehead. Seeing this, Rahne tells Jamie that she thought he didn’t reabsorb damage that dupes sustained… Like elevated blood alcohol? he asks. No, but mental synapses, yes. And since the dupe’s brain was pickled, well…</p><p>How’s the coffee coming, he asks, changing the subject. Bringing to steaming cups to the couch upon which Jamie has collapsed, Rahne hands it to him, joking that she carved him a slice. Now changing the subject on her own, she asks him about the whole “detective” thing… why? And how’d he get a license? Answering the last question first, Jamie replies through an old FBI contact. As for the why… ‘cause, dumb as it sounds, he still wants to help people. Plus, he continues, with a wry <em>y’know</em>, he gets to meet gorgeous women.</p><p>Unconvinced, Rahne retorts that he’s been watching too many old movies. Plus, he knows bloody jack-all about detection. He… Rahne stops in surprise as Jamie sits up from the couch and grabs her chin by his right hand, examining her open mouth. Next, he grabs her ankle, lifting up her foot to examine the sole of her shoe, all despite her protestations. Reclining back, Jamie informs her that, on the way there, she stopped for a hot dog and relish at Nathan’s, gave a dollar to a homeless man, stopped by Midtown Comics to look at Muppet toys, stepped in a puddle at 32nd and 5th, and bought a copy of the <em>Daily News</em> but wound up giving it to another homeless man.</p><p>As Rahne takes this in, Jamie smiles inwardly, noting that his “Sherlock Holmes” riff should impress her. Finally managing to speak, Rahne stammers in question, <em>H-How did he…</em>? Sipping his coffee in satisfaction, Jamie merely replies that it’s a trade secret. Yep, he thinks to himself. Worked like a charm.</p><p>With the opening of the door once again, a new voice makes his presence known, with a simple “I’m back.” Turning to view the new arrival, Rahne is once again taken aback, as Jamie stands there. Unlike the Jamie Madrox still sitting on the couch, this Jamie is dressed in a monk’s robe, his head clean-shaven and a simple walking stick in his hand. Seeing that his “Kwai Chang” dupe has made his triumphant return, Jamie notes that he’s a week ahead of schedule.</p><p>Approaching the still-astonished Rahne, the monk Madrox addresses her, telling her that it has been several years. Receiving a startled <em>it has?</em>, Monk Madrox tells Rahne that she has grown into a fine young woman. Is she assisting with the office? Still startled but able to speak more coherently, Rahne replies just part-time, just to help… set up.</p><p>Deftly taking the mug from her hand, Jamie informs Rahne that there’s a bar downstairs across the street, called the Power Plant. Guido, he tells her, should be in about this time. He’d love to see her. When Rahne begins to protest, Jamie walks her to the door, telling her that he’ll be right down after he’s reabsorbed the dupe. As the monk Madrox bows in respect, telling Rahne for peace to be with her, Rahne tells Jamie that this is weird – doesn’t he see that? Closing the door in front of her, Jamie pretends to think aloud for a moment, before finally settling on the decision that it is not. Nope, no, not seeing that.</p><p>As the door comes to a close, Jamie recalls to himself that there’s a reason they’re called “private eyes.” It’s because they always keep aspects of themselves private; locked away so that no one… even their most trusted friends… can ever fully know them. Either that or no one wants to be seen in public with them. Yeah, he decides – that’s it.</p><p>Upon entering the Power Plant, Rahne is immediately addressed as “jailbait.” Looking to the bartender, Rahne sees a grey-skinned woman, with green octopus-like tentacles coming from her back. When Rahne asks her if she meant her, the bartender confirms it, lamenting that the liquor authority doesn’t hassle her enough for being a mutant bat. Now she has to worry about underage booze hounds?</p><p>Telling “<a data-ref-id=\"4005-59220\" href=\"/lefty/4005-59220/\">Lefty</a>,” to ease up, a hulking figure with monstrous-sized hands states that he’ll vouch for her. Turning around, Rahne finds herself engulfed in the gigantic arms of Guido Carosella. Hearing her call him by his former yet humorous nom de guerre of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-7599\" href=\"/strong-guy/4005-7599/\">Strong Guy</a>, Guido winces. Make one joke at a press conference, he states, and you’re stuck with a name for life. Now calling out to Lefty, Guido orders a scotch and soda to his regular table. Same for the lady, he the adds, ‘cept hold the scotch.</p><p>A few steps later, the two make themselves comfortable at Guido’s special table – built on two scales. One side is regular in size, for the average-sized person, while the other side is constructed on a larger scale, conforming to his Brobdingnagian form. Craning her neck to look at Guido, Rahne asks him how things are going with Lila. She heard he and she were an item… Shrugging this off, Guido replies simply an “eh,” adding that he doesn’t like to talk about it. Surprised, Rahne asks “really,” stating that the word was the two of them were… Cutting Rahne off, Guido snarls his lip, repeating slowly and vehemently that he doesn’t. like. t’talk about it. Okay?</p><p>Getting the point, Rahne quickly asks if they can talk about Jamie. Hearing this, Guido’s stern countenance instantly transforms into a broad grin. Replying that, sure, <em>him</em> he’ll talk about, Guido states that he’s his best friend in the world. Well… he thinks to add, ‘sides himself. Frowning at this, Rahne looks downwards, replying that that’s her point. First he quit his job at X-Corp in Paris. Paris! Who’d want t’leave Paris? In response to this, Guido replies that, nowadays?, who wouldn’t? Ignoring this, Rahne adds that now he’s so… distracted. Distant.</p><p>Still smiles, Guido tells Rahne that she’s gotta keep something in mind. Jamie’s raised “keeping to himself” to an art form. His parents kept him isolated on a small farm, wearing a special control suit so he wouldn’t keep churnin’ out duplicates every time he <em>hit</em> something, or something hit <em>him</em>. Then, they died in an accident, and the kid was stuck on his own for months, ‘fore anybody found out. That’s gotta screw you up a bit. Plus, Guido continues, she knows about the dupes he’s been sending around, right?</p><p>Seeing that she doesn’t Guido tells Rahne that the detective thing’s a recent development. Before that, Jamie couldn’t decide what direction to go in his life, so he went in all directions at once. He’s been sending dupes the past few years to learn about various stuff. Then they come back and he reabsorbs them… and gains their knowledge. Thing is, he flakes out anywhere from a minute to an hour while his brain processes it. He <em>saw</em> it once, Guido states. It’s terrifying but fascinating…</p><p>Guido’s explanation draws to a close as he sees someone entering the bar. Recognizing him instantly, but detecting something amiss, Guido belts out an inquisitive <em>Madrox</em>? Stumbling to Guido’s table, a sweating and bleeding Jamie Madrox states, through barely coherent words, that he couldn’t make it… upstairs… to office… Though Guido still doesn’t know what is wrong, Rahne knows immediately, telling Guido that she smells blood on him. A lot! His own blood. Stepping forward, Rahne manages to catch the collapsing Jamie. Finally able to examine him more closely, Rahne tells Guido that there’s blood everywhere… she thinks he’s been stabbed.</p><p>Cradled by her, Jamie tries to sort things out through his delirious mind, asking Rahne what she’s doing there. At first, Rahne is confused, as he told her to wait there, until she realizes it’s a dupe. Understanding that as well, Guido runs to the street, stating that he’s on it. Rahne’s statement to go get the real Jamie, draws panicked ire from Guido, who repeats loudly that he’s <em>on it</em>! Approaching the door, he calls back to Rahne, telling her to cover her ears. Just as she begins to ask why, Guido stands at the door, his hands funneling his booming voice in a cupping motion, and yells out into the night sky toward Jamie’s building: <em>Maaaadrooooox</em>!!</p><p>Quickly making his way across the street and to the bar, Jamie thinks to himself that Guido sounded freaked… and he can’t even think about what could possibly freak Guido. Arriving at the door, Jamie finds himself pushed in by the massive Guido, to his dying duplicate inside. Finally seeing the reason why Guido was freaked, he decides that he doesn’t want to think about it any more.</p><p>Sitting next to the unconscious form of the duplicate, Rahne calls out to Jamie, telling him to hurry, and to reabsorb him. Hearing a stammering reply that he can’t, Rahne replies that she doesn’t understand. Likewise in the dark, Guido points out that the dupe is unconscious… it’s the only way. Hearing the real Madrox reply that he doesn’t care, Guido points out that if he dies without him taking his memories… “Still <em>not</em> caring!!!” Jamie retorts.</p><p>As the moments pass, Jamie tries to assess the situation. How can he explain to them that it’s happened to him before? A dupe, right on the edge… and he takes him… It’s like dying himself. Like… his soul’s being torn in half. He doesn’t absorb the wound… but the trauma of what he feels… felt… it’s… He just can’t.</p><p>Lost in thought, Jamie is returned to the present by Rahne’s pleas. He’s been stabbed, she tells him. A killer’s out there! If he doesn’t stop him…! His arms wide in feigned helplessness, Jamie asks if he does stop him - so what? <em>Another’ll</em> take his place! There’s always more killers, he states. That’s what humans do! Produce killers in endless supply. Fine, Rahne spits back. He can explain <em>that</em> to the families of his future victims.</p><p>Finding Rahne’s words biting, Jamie thinks that he hates that she’s right. He also hates that there’s another likelihood she hasn’t even considered: that this wasn’t a random assault. That someone’s targeted him, and they hit a dupe now. but next time… they might get him. Reaching down, Jamie places his forefinger to his duplicate, which begins to shimmer as it is reabsorbed.</p><p>(flashback)</p><p>A pain shoots/shot through Jamie. A scream cries/cried out. Drops of blood splatter/splattered. An elevated train speeds/sped. A picture of a brunette smiles/smiled up from a newspaper, dated March 24th. A skyscraper rises/rose into the air. A knife, bloodied.</p><p>Jamie smiles, dressed only in his trousers, and laughs at the night air, rain pouring down on him and the rock upon which he stands. He’s… alone. Truly alone. Just him… and God… and inner peace. No infinite number of dupes knocking around inside him, waiting their turn. Just a man… And his dog, he adds, as a collie begins to lick him. Okay. A dog. Dogs are good. Looking away, almost at someone else, the collie states that he’s coming around.</p><p>(present)</p><p>Jamie Madrox rubs his eyes. It’s no longer a dog hovering over him, but Rahne, a wet washcloth in hand. Taking stock of his new reality, as well as the one he just left, Jamie asks a flabbergasted Rahne if she was just licking his face just now. Replying defensively that she was not, she presents the washcloth. Right, fine, whatever, Jamie replies, managing to sit up on his couch. It figures, he thinks to himself. Bogart has Mary Astor. Russell Crowe has Kim Basinger. He has Lassie.</p><p>Sitting on the other end of the couch and reading newspaper, Guido welcomes Jamie back to the land of the living. When the befuddled Jamie asks how long he was out, Guido answers seventeen years. The U.S., he informs Jamie, was bought by the Swiss. The national bird is now the cuckoo, but the chocolate’s better. Now turning the Rahne, Jamie asks the same questions, this time receiving the more believable answer of twenty minutes – though it felt like seventeen years.</p><p>Helping Jamie to his feet, Rahne asks if he sees anything. The killer? No to either, Jamie replies. The dupe didn’t see his face, or it was so traumatic that he blocked it out. Taking a moment to lift his nose out of the paper, Guido asks nonchalantly if it was a random killing. Placing his jacket on, Jamie replies that he’s thinking not. His guess is that someone targeted him. The dupe’s thoughts were screwed-up… but they were also focused… on Chicago, he thinks. He saw the Sears Tower… and the El. And some woman. Of course, Guido confirms, there’s <em>always</em> a woman. Hearing this, Rahne congratulates Jamie. He got his wish. She hopes she’s gorgeous enough t’die for. Me too, he replies.</p><p>Rising from the couch, Guido asks Jamie what their next move is. There’s no “our,” Jamie replies. He’s doing this on his own. He takes being murdered pretty personally. With this, Jamie hits his fist against the wall, creating a duplicate. Addressing the dupe, as well as Rahne and Guido, Jamie tells them to stay there. He expects the attacker’ll be looking to make sure he finished the job… or even kill every Jamie Madrox there is. Hearing this, the newly created dupe realizes he’s bait – oh, joy.</p><p>Pausing at the door before leaving, Jamie turns back to Rahne and states that she never said – what does she think of the company name? Replying bluntly, Rahne states that it sounded like he investigates pornography. Closing the door to XXX Investigations behind him, Jamie thinks to himself that he can live with that.</p>",

But what no one knows is that this gorgeous redhead's exuberant personality is a shell designed to make her forget about life's harsh realities. From her social life to her undying interest in becoming an actress to her crush on that costumed crime-fighter who swings along the New York City rooftops, it's clear that Mary Jane just wants to escape. Join MJ, Harry Osborn, Liz Allan, Flash Thompson and Harry's nerdy friend, Peter Parker, as they experience the thrilling highs and the crushing lows of high-school existence!</em></p><p>Queens, New York.</p><p>Liz Allan is trying to convince Mary Jane to go to the Homecoming Dance with Harry Osborn. Mary Jane protests, and says that Harry is like a brother to her and that she's looking for something more exciting. Liz tells Mary Jane that she's being unrealistic, but MJ already has someone in mind. As Mary Jane is called down to dinner, we get a glimpse of her bedroom wall which is covered in photos of Spiderman.</p><p>The next day in school, Liz Allan rushes up to MJ, complaining about her boyfriend Flash. Liz is extremely excited about the Homecoming Dance and really wants to be Queen, with Flash as her King. Flash, unfortunately, doesn't share the same ambitions.</p><p>Liz tells MJ that Flash missed the deadline for signing up, but that she managed to pull some strings and get him in. After she's done ranting, Liz begs MJ to reconsider going with Harry, so that they can all double date. Liz, MJ, Flash and Harry have known each other since they were children.</p><p>Just as Liz leaves, Harry pops up behind MJ, scaring her. Harry asks MJ if she's running for Homecoming Queen, and is relieved when she says no, fearing that it would drive a wedge between the four friends.</p><p>After school the four meet at a cafe, the Coffee Bean. Peter Parker approaches Harry, and asks him if they're still doing their science project together. Flash insults Peter, telling him to get a life. Flash asks MJ who she's going to the Homecoming Dance with, and Liz whisks him away, leaving MJ and Harry alone to talk. Harry gets up and goes over to Peter's table, where he consoles the insulted Parker. Impressed with his sensitive ways, MJ asks Harry out to dinner.</p><p>In gym class, while playing badminton, MJ spills the beans to Liz, who is absolutely ecstatic. Liz is happy that her friend has finally stopped fantasizing about Spiderman.</p><p>Friday Night.</p><p>Harry takes MJ to an expensive restaurant, where she feels awkward and underdressed. The menu is in french, and MJ is overwhelmed, but Harry says he's been to this restaurant many times before and orders for both of them.</p><p>After the restaurant, Harry takes MJ on a carriage ride through Central Park and the two reminisce about their childhood. Harry tells MJ that he never wants to hide anything from her, and wants to tell her everything. Mary Jane becomes uncomfortable and decides to go home.</p><p>Suddenly, the back of the subway car MJ is in bursts open and she is almost sucked out. MJ holds on and dangles out of the back as Electro and Spiderman tussle inside the car. Just as MJ loses her grip, she is saved by Spiderman. Spiderman disables Electro and takes MJ home, dropping her right outside her house. MJ asks Spidey how he knew where she lived, leaving Spiderman to give an awkward excuse and swing away.</p><p>The next day at the Coffee Bean, MJ tells Liz all about her brush with death. Liz, however, is more interested in how MJ's date with Harry went. MJ says that she doesn't feel like Harry is the right guy for her, and says that she'd really like to go to Homecoming with Spiderman.</p>",

By re-imagining Marvel's most popular characters without superhuman powers, this series will strip down to the core heroes we have all come to know and love. These characters - including Peter Parker, Matt Murdock and Logan - were fated to be heroes. Just because Peter Parker wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider doesn't mean he didn't do battle with a madman named Norman Osborn. Matt Murdock? Blinded, yes - but with no heightened senses. However, he did become a legal champion of the poor in Hell's Kitchen, and he did cross paths with Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin. And Logan is, of course, the enigmatic - and amnesiac - drifter on the run from his past.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Discover the secret history of the Young Avengers when Jessica Jones and Kat Farrell investigate the kids' origins for a special issue of THE PULSE. Who were they and what were their lives like before they met Iron Lad? And what is the future of the team without him? Find out in the YOUNG AVENGERS SPECIAL #1.</i></p><p>Kat Farrell is fascinated by the Young Avengers. She wants to know exactly what happened and she's willing to go straight to Cassie to find out. Jessica finally concedes that she'll talk to the Young Avengers and see if they'll talk to Kat. She goes to each team member and chats to them about their pasts and what made them become heroes.</p><p>She just wanted to know what happened to her father. That's all. Skipping school, she went to Stark Tower and waited to see Tony Stark. Even when his assistant tried to convince her he was too busy to see her, she stayed. She just wanted to know.</p><p>Telling the assistant that she'd wait all day, Cassie is about ready to do just that when her mother shows up and insists she goes to school. Cassie shouts that she just wants to know what happened, how her father died. Her mother's boyfriend, a cop called Blake, turns up to take Cassie to school. To make matters worse, Tony has apparently found a window in his schedule and he can see her when he gets there.</p><p>Blake insists that Cassie is going to school, he throws her father's criminal record in her face, saying that he's just as much a hero even without super powers. Their argument becomes heated and she shoves him hard. She asks him if he's such a hero, why can't he do better than picking up truanting children. At that, her mother slaps her hard and Cassie storms out.</p><p>That night, Cassie packed a bag, intent on running away. But as she left the house, she caught a news broadcast about a new team, the first outing of the Young Avengers. She discovered she'd inherited her father's powers and she found a new family, a place to be a hero.</p><p>If she had runaway, she would have headed to Los Angeles to join the Runaways. But all she wanted was to know how her father died and to walk his path.</p><p>It was always obvious to him that he was different to everyone else at school. He could change his appearance to fit in, make himself look just like people expected him to. He joined the basketball team and soon became best friends with the team captain, Greg Norris. One day, he told Greg about his ability to change his shape.</p><p>Greg thought this was the coolest thing and convinced Teddy to use his powers so that they could both do anything they wanted. Teddy got them into premiers pretending to be Tony Stark. He signed autographs as Johnny Storm. He even made public appearances as the Hulk.</p><p>Then Iron Man declared that the Avengers were being disbanded and that Avengers Mansion would be made into a public landmark and memorial. Greg had the idea that they should go to the mansion and raid it for souvenirs but as it became increasingly clear that Greg was only after making quick cash, Teddy threatened him. He didn't want the memory of the Avengers desecrated. Greg called him a freak and ran off. Alone now, Teddy stared at a picture of the great team when Iron Lad approached him and recruited him for the Young Avengers.</p><p>Bullied for being different at school, Billy found his solace in sitting outside the Avenger's Mansion. On one of those times, he'd been beaten up by the biggest, meanest kid in school, name of John Kesler, when a woman in red sweats asks him if he's okay. He's not okay. He's angry and bleeding but when he looks up he realises it's the Scarlet Witch. In a fit of awe, he blurts out that she's his favourite Avenger.</p><p>They walk together for a while and she gives him the advice that everyone has gifts, even if they're not super powers, and they're all worthwhile. She tells him to stand his ground and he himself. Then she heals him with a touch and kisses his cheek before they part ways.</p><p>The next morning, Billy's walking through school. He knows he'd never be able to stand up for himself so he re-arranges his schedule to avoid Kesler as much as possible. But then he sees the bully picking on a smaller kid. Billy gets angry. He pushes in and just as he's about to get pummelled, it turns out that he does have power and he used them to stand up for the kid.</p><p>But that first time, he lost control and almost killed Kesler. He ran to the Avengers Mansion but they'd been disbanded and Scarlet Witch wasn't there to make it better any more. Iron Lad found him there and made him into Asgardian who later became Wiccan.</p><p>Kate's mother died a year ago. She spent her life trying to use the Bishop wealth to change the world. Kate was never entirely comfortable with how wealthy her family is and she tried to convince her sister that all the money she was spending on a flash wedding could be put to charity, to actually changing lives and helping people. Her sister retorted that if their mother hadn't spent her life running around trying to save the world then she'd still be alive.</p><p>Kate wanted to help though. She couldn't just be wealthy and let it lie. She started helping out at soup kitchens and helping the homeless. But one night on her way home from school, she was attacked in the woods. She realised that bad things happen, things that could destroy you if you let them.</p><p>She chose to learn from it. She threw herself into training, became an expert archer and marksman, worked on her fighting skills. Then when the Young Avengers tried to save her at her sister's wedding, she chose to join them.</p><p>Eli was never sure if his grandfather had really been the black Captain America. The old man had been so badly damaged that he couldn't speak and rarely stood up for himself. It shamed Eli to think that his grandfather wasn't really a hero.</p><p>One evening on the way home from the store, Eli and his grandfather were set upon by bullies. One of them threw a bottle at his grandfather, knocking him to the ground. Eli grabbed the bottle and was going to go after the kid when two lads stopped him. They asked him how he expected to take on a gang of bullies on his own when he didn't have any powers himself. They then sold him the mutant growth hormone.</p><p>Talking to his grandmother, Eli realised that it didn't matter if his grandfather had been Captain America. He was still a hero. So he asked to play ball in the yard. When his grandfather threw the ball too far, Eli ran off to catch it. The bullies were waiting. They started to beat him up but just as he reached for the pills his grandfather intervened. It was over before it started and suddenly Eli didn't want to take the pills because he was ashamed, he wanted to take them so he could be just like his grandfather, the black Captain America.</p>",

How far is he willing to go to get them back? </em></p><p><em>All he wanted was to make the world a perfect place for mutantkind. Pietro Maximoff was Quicksilver, the fastest living creature on Earth until the Scarlet Witch took it all away. Now the son of Magneto is despised, rejected, and alone. Down-and-out in Mutant Town where the few remaining mutants are fighting a desperate battle for survival. </em></p><p><em>And just when he thought things couldn't get any worse, along comes a Spider-Man.... </em></p><p><span><span>Run Down Apartment in NYC: </span></span></p><p>Pietro Maximoff lays in bed, sleeping in his underwear and dirty ragged shirt. He was the fastest living creature on the planet. He was so fast he was a blur to human eyes. Bullets could not touch him. He could run up the sides of buildings and snatch arrows out of the air. He was built for speed; running zero to sixty in seven seconds. His top speed was almost 220 miles per hour. His body adapted to withstand the accelerated impact of his feet hitting the ground thirty times per second.</p><p>As morning comes, Pietro, who hasn’t shaven in days, is bothered by a fly that buzzes right into his face. He curls up the newspaper, with an image of Purity activist William Stryker on its front, and tries to bat away the fly. Instead, he is too slow, and ends up knocking over his cup, spilling its contents. Pietro sits up in bed and looks down at the liquid on the floor, thinking. As the uninjured fly lands on the newspaper, Pietro gets up and, undresses so he can shower. When he is done, Pietro looks at himself in the mirror, and then proceeds to dress and pull out a bottle of liquor from his nightstand. The bottle is empty.</p><p>The man walks down to the store, and thinks to himself that his bones could absorb shocks that would shatter those of normal men. His tendons had the resilience of high tensile steel. His body metabolized food so efficiently that there was virtually no waste. He never carried an ounce of excess fat. He processes information at five times the speed of the average college student, as the data leaped from synapse to synapse. Today, it takes him much too long to read the nutrition facts on the back of a jar.</p><p>Pietro gets into the express checkout lane, but he is not as fast moving as he once was. Annoyed, a customer behind him tells Pietro to hurry up as he reaches into his pocket to pay. This is the express checkout, reminds the disgruntled customer. Like, for people in a <em>hurry</em>. Duh.</p><p>Pietro leaves the store, along with another bottle of liquor, without saying a word to the other man. Outside, he sees his bus speed by and runs after it. Once, he could have run across the surface of the water. However, this time Pietro slips and falls, spilling his groceries all over in the rain, as pedestrians hurry by and do not help him.</p><p>He was like the wind or a lightning bolt. He was superb; he was perfection; he was Quicksilver!</p><p><em>Avengers Tower: </em></p><p>Peter Parker stands in his Spider-Man costume, sans mask, and looks despondently out the window at the rain pouring outside. Peter, asks his wife Mary Jane as she walks into the room. Didn’t he hear her calling him? How long has be just been standing there? Peter does not respond, so Mary Jane tells him that they have to talk about this. Something is wrong.</p><p>Silently, Peter begins to put his mask on, so Mary Jane tells him not to do it. She can’t talk to him when he has the mask on. Peter puts it on anyway and turns to his wife, telling her that he is ok. He just has to go out. You are not ok, says Mary Jane firmly. I’m ok, reiterates Peter.</p><p>Spider-Man swings out of Avengers Tower and through the streets of the city. He doesn’t think Mary Jane would understand what he is feeling right now. For her, the world is as it always was, but for him it will never be the same. For a while he had everything he ever wanted in life. He had the woman he wanted – and it wasn’t her.</p><p>Spider-Man stops on a rooftop and looks at a high-rise deck, with a family enjoying time in the rain. Peter then thinks about his time in the House of M world, and his wife Gwen and his son Ritchie.</p><p>As the rain stops, Spider-Man gets up and takes off his mask. Tears begin to fall from his eyes as he mourns.</p><p><em>Pietro’s Apartment: </em></p><p>Pietro returns to his apartment drenched. How can they live like this? How can they stand to be human? Pietro takes off his long jacket and sits in bed with a drink and a photo of him, his sister, Hawkeye, Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. He and Wanda came so close to creating an almost perfect world. If it weren’t for a few imperfections that brought it all down, it would have worked. If they could start all over again he knows they’d get it right. However, now he doesn’t even know where Wanda is. She is gone and she has taken away his birthright. ‘No more mutants’ is what she said. She got it wrong again. There are mutants out there. Not too many though; not him.</p><p>Pietro takes out his uniform from his closet and puts it on. He pours another drink and looks out to the night sky. What has his perfect sister done to him? She was always the strong one. She told him never to give up hope. Where on Earth does he go from here?</p><p>Suddenly, Pietro gets up and stares long and hard at the full moon. He then puts down his shot glass and rummages through his things. It must be here. He knows he kept it. Finally, Pietro finds what he was looking for – a small bronze signaling device of design not reminiscent of any <em>human</em> architecture.</p><p>Quicksilver goes out onto the fire escape and activates the device. He then says out loud that, if she has any feelings left for him at all, she will answer. He looks back up at the moon and mutters that she must tell him that there is a place where he can be more than human again.</p><p>Suddenly, Pietro’s attention is called to the alley below, where three men are harassing another. One man, Bodie, tells Johnny to stay cool and he isn’t going to get hurt – if Johnny has been straight with Bodie and his crew. There is a whisper going around that Johnny is a mutant. I used to be, replies Johnny, but not anymore. Didn’t Bodie hear? Yeah, replies Bodie. They aren’t morons. They watch television. However, they hear that a few mutants have immunity or something. So they are going to check Johnny out. Their common friend, Sally – Johnny remembers Sally right? – well, she said there was something weird about Johnny. As the men begin to push Johnny around, he tells Bodie that he was drunk. Bodies feels something under Johnny’s shirt and begins to rip it off, but what the three men find underneath is not what they expected.</p><p>Johnny looks down at his chest and abdomen, which is covered in tentacles. More than that, a pair of red eyes stare back, as well as a mouth! Please, says Johnny, he cannot help it. The three men back away slowly, wondering what that thing is. Bodie comes close to touch it, but his friends tell him not to. At that moment, the creature on Johnny’s chest reaches out with its tentacles and grabs Bodie! One of the other men tells Johnny to let Bodie go, but Johnny explains that the creature has its own nervous system. It just reacts.</p><p>The men take out a blade, and chop off a tentacle, causing the creature to spasm and shriek in pain. Blood pours out of the creature, weakening Johnny, who falls back against a wall in pain. However, Bodie is released. As the men surround for the kill, Quicksilver comes down and tells them to leave Johnny alone.</p><p>Unimpressed, Bodie asks the man who he is supposed to be. I’ll give you a second chance to walk away, says Pietro. Neh, says Bodie. He will just punch Quicksilver instead. Pietro calls Bodie pathetic, but Bodie is much faster than Pietro and punches him square across the face! Pietro falls into some trash defeated, and the three men turn back to Johnny. It seems some radical surgery is called for.</p><p>Before Bodie can do anything, a web grabs the knife out of his hand. Spider-Man descends and tells the men, as he beats them up, that this is what he loves about the city. Every time he needs to hit someone really hard, some jerk steps up and volunteers. He can feel all the stress flowing right out of him. He has friends who swear by yoga Tibetan chanting, but the crunch of knuckles in a bad guy’s face always does it for him.</p><p>As Spider-Man beats up the men, Quicksilver quickly sneaks away.</p><p>Spider-Man turns to Johnny, who is in bad shape. Johnny is not sure how he is. He cannot feel the wound, and he thinks he is going to pass out. Spider-Man makes a tourniquet for the injured creature and tells Johnny that he is losing a lot of blood. Does he have a cell phone? Inside pocket, stammers the weak Johnny.</p><p>Spider-Man gets the phone and dials for an ambulance. Johnny, who can’t even keep his head up, mutters that they say less than one percent of mutants stayed mutants - one in a hundred; that is him. You convinced me, says Spider-Man when he gets off the phone, life sucks. The good news, though, is that help is on the way, so Johnny should sit tight and think happy thoughts. Spider-Man then looks up at the fire escape to see Quicksilver quietly skulk away, and tells Johnny that he thinks he just spotted another bad guy.</p><p>Spider-Man sneaks to the top of the roof before Pietro can get there, and then uses his webs to grab Pietro and pull him up. Before Quicksilver can say anything, Spider-Man holds the man by the collar and tells him that the last time Parker saw hi, Pietro was being crushed to a pulp by his dad. Peter cannot blame Magneto for that. Spider-Man then throws Quicksilver against the doorway from the room to the apartment, and demands to know why Pietro did it. Why did Quicksilver wreck his life?!</p><p>Angry, Quicksilver asks Spider-Man if he thinks he wanted this. Look at him! He is living like a fugitive. He has earned the hatred of his father. His sister is gone. He doesn’t even know if Wanda is alive. Pietro swings at Spider-Man, yelling that he has lost everything. Spider-Man sidesteps the blow easily. You see, asks Pietro, he has even lost his speed. Spider-Man cannot imagine what it is like to be so slow.</p><p>Spider-Man pushes Quicksilver up against the wall and laughs sarcastically in his face. He then pulls him to the roof’s edge to show him the ambulance takes Johnny away. What does Pietro think about Johnny? Does Pietro think that would have happened if he and his sister hadn’t screwed with the world? How about the thousands of lives destroyed – all the mutants who aren’t mutants anymore? How do they feel?</p><p>Spider-Man then lifts Pietro off the ground by his throat, and in a rage asks the former mutant about himself. He had a perfect little boy in a perfect world that Pietro and Wanda made. The woman he loved, who was dead, was alive again. They had a baby! He has lost his son!</p><p>Spider-Man lets Pietro go, and tells him that people say the worst thing that can happen to anyone is to bury your own child. However, Spider-Man feels that there is something worse. His son is dead, and Peter cannot bury him, because he never existed.</p><p>Spider-Man sits and holds his head. He cannot even tell his wife. This morning he is sitting there with all these memories swirling around. He is grieving for his dead son, and she is telling him a joke she heard on Letterman. Then she wonders why Peter isn’t laughing!</p><p>Pietro, who stands on the ledge, apologizes to Spider-Man. If he could do anything to make things right, he would. However, he cannot. Spider-Man, looking down at the roof, figures that makes Pietro a waste of space, doesn’t it? It does, says Pietro as he stares off into the night sky. Can Spider-Man think of a single reason why he should go on living? No, Pietro, says Spider-Man as he looks away, truthfully he cannot.</p><p>Spider-Man looks back – and Pietro is gone! Spider-Man quickly looks over the edge to see Quicksilver plummeting to the ground. Horrified, Spider-Man shoots a web, but it is not fast enough to stop the fall, and Pietro lands hard.</p><p>Spider-Man leaps down. He didn’t mean for Pietro to kill himself! As he bends down to check on the still man, there is a surge of energy, as two beings teleport into the alley. “Spider-Man?” asks the woman.</p><p>Spider-Man looks up to see Quicksilver’s estranged wife, Crystal of the Inhumans, and the beast known as Lockjaw, standing before him.</p><p>“What have you done to my husband?” demands a horrified Crystal.</p>",

Whenever he gets close to the edge, a mysterious fog brings him back to the center of town. </p><p>One day a group of cheerleaders arrives at Silent Hill. They find Ike's place and they make themselves at home which bothers the artist. A pair of cheerleaders are captured by the monsters and Ike is forced to help Cheryl (the captain of the squad) to get them back. </p><p>In the end the cheerleaders manage to escape and they leave Ike behind in combat. But a surprise may be awaiting the squad since the two cheerleaders they rescued seem to be changed by the evil in Silent Hill.</p>",

Dr. Bruce Banner has been presumed dead since his execution, following his murderous rampage through Manhattan as the Hulk. But when reports start cropping up of an unidentified creature appearing around the globe, Nick Fury begins to get worried. Not because Banner can turn from man to unstoppable monster in seconds...but because Banner's existence is the one secret that can bring down Fury. Fury turns to the only man he can trust: Wolverine. And he's only too glad to take care of Banner-by any means necessary.</em></p> <p>This is the first issue of a re-make of Wolverine's first appearance.</p> <p>It starts off by showing us a badly wounded Wolverine and a very shocking 2nd page, then the writer decided to \"Tarantino\" it and show us Wolverine meeting Nick Fury, Betty Ross and Jennifer Walters, during this time Nick Fury asks Wolverine if he could \"take out\" the Hulk quickly and quietly, when Nick offers Wolverine something in return he simply replied \"You said he's tough, it'll be fun\"</p> <p>Then they jump ahead to Tibet 4 hours before we find Wolverine, he is in a bar drinking and then he asks a local why their are no girls in this \"town\", the man replied \"I...... no speak....... english\"</p> <p>Then they jump to 91 minutes before we find Wolverine and he is in his \"suit\" and is following a man with these yaks, he eventually tracks him back to a mountain, with a really big door on the front, the man enters, shortly after Wolverine opens the massive door and finds a quite content Hulk with dozens and dozens of beautiful women lying on and around him, everyone including the girls look up and the man that had opened the door only to find a calm Wolverine who un-sheathes his claws and says \"Hi Bruce\"</p>",

But it won't be all fun and games as she contends with an overbearing aunt, a principal who wants her expelled and a mutant gang-leader who just may have the hots for her. Jubilee is an all-ages, new-reader-friendly romp that will get you in touch with your mall mojo. <br /><br /><strong><em>Spoilers<br /></em></strong><br />At her first day at her new school, Jubilee makes a friend in fellow student, Meg. When visiting the local mall with Meg, she makes another fellow student, Missy, jealous, by staring at Missy’s boyfriend, Dale. When Missy wants to fight her for that, Jubilee unleashes her mutant powers on her and almost gets expelled. But the principal and his assistant make a deal with Jubilee: unless she wants to get expelled, she will become the new school counselor. Not really having a choice, Jubilee accepts the deal. Before going to the next class, Dale apologizes to Jubilee for his girlfriend’s behavior. Jubilee accepts the apology, saying that it wasn’t such a big deal. Dale leaves, saying that he’ll see her around. Watching him go, Jubilee gets a crush on him.</p>",

            "description": "<p><i>In an arid world filled with decay and despair - where the faith of the people rests in a thirst for something to believe in - a mysterious girl with mystical powers of sight tries to find a way forward for her tribe.</i></p><p>The book begins with a history of the earth. We are informed that a giant sea creature called Stone destroyed five continents and drank the seas. From space the earth now looks brown, as all the oceans have been replaced by the Sakai or \"sand sea\": sort of like liquid sand.</p><p>On the Sakai, a gang of youths are on what appears to be an old oil derrick. They are anxious, because one of them named Zizi has been in the Sakai for over ten minutes. Suddenly, she comes bursting out of the sand riding what seems to be a mutant dolphin called a \"devourer\". They disappear back into the sand, and we get our first look inside the Sakai. It's full of floating half-skyscrapers and other ruins of civilization. Zizi comes up once more, this time with the dead devourer in tow. The youths congratulate her, but want to hurry up and return home. Zizi calls them cowards and tells them that the \"Black Current\" is straight ahead. It's revealed that Zizi is the only one with the ability to see the Black Current. The teens prepare to get in their boat and head home, but are interrupted by a roguish stranger passing by in his vessel. The stranger asks them if they know anything about a nearby \"treasure island\". Zizi sarcastically asks him if he's supposed to be some kind of pirate. The stranger responds that he prefers \"aggressively persuasive merchant\" and tells the group that he heard it was possible to catch lots of sand whales near the island.</p><p>Meanwhile, a tall tatooed man named Gaira is returning home from an unsuccessful hunting mission with his crew. They live on an ancient aircraft carrier, and the people are despondent. It's been three months without a whale being caught. As he disembarks from his hunting vessel, Gaira talks to an elder named Thunder. Gaira tells the elder that the lord of the Sakai appears to be deserting them, but Thunder tells him not to blaspheme. They go on to discuss Zizi and her ability to see the Black Current; Gaira is suspicious and considers them children's stories. It's also revealed that it's impossible for a normal human to see inside the Sakai. As they walk and talk, they're shocked to see a devourer hanging from a hook.</p><p>Nene and Zizi are deep within the carrier, bathing in the lake that surrounds the tree of hope. Nene notices the wounds on Zizi's arm and asks her how she got them. Zizi makes up an excuse and says that she fell, however Gaira enters and says they look like devourer bitemarks. We can tell that Nene has a crush on Gaira because her word balloon has a tiny heart inside it. Anyways, Gaira asks Zizi if she was really the one that killed the devourer. Zizi remains silent, and then he asks her if she can actually see inside the Sakai. He tells her of their people's history. Of how they came to their \"island\" 300 years ago riding on the back of a great sand whale. He tells her that she is different; no one else could have killed a devourer within the Sakai. Zizi stares at the tattoo on the back of her hand and her interior thoughts reveal that her parents had came to the island while they were pregnant with her. They never told her where they were from originally.</p><p>Zizi and Gaira walk up to the deck and continue talking. He asks her if she can see into the Black Current. Zizi sarcastically asks him why he wants to know. Gaira grabs her and tells her that the Black Current destroyed the ancient civilizations; if it comes they island it and everybody aboard would be destroyed. Zizi says that the last time she felt the Black Current was on \"Lighthouse Island\", about 10km west. She sticks her hand into the sand and tells Gaira that Black Current is not coming their way; however pirates ARE.</p><p>Captain Suv(the roguish stranger Zizi met earlier) hears from his crew that they're nearing the bountiful island. They ask for permission to land, but Suv denies the request. He tells the crew that the island is supposedly full of savage natives, and he wants to do some \"sightseeing\" first. At that moment, something attacks Suv's ship and destroys the stern. Suv asks what just happened, and a giant mutant whale called a leviathan jumps out of the water and takes another bite out of his ship. Suv pulls out a gun and shoots the creature, to no effect. Then Zizi appears in the sky with a harpoon in her hand. She pierces the monster and rides it away from Suv's ship. The leviathan attempts to dive, and creates a whirlpool in the sand. The leviathan surfaces again, this time Zizi is victorious. She has killed the monster. Suv is awestruck, and decides that he picked the wrong week to quit drinking.</p><p>Zizi reboards her island, while the other natives use their equipment to drag the sand whale aboard ship. The crowd celebrates her becoming a true whale-huntress. Later, she and her gang of youths take a raft over to Suv's sinking ship. She manages to persuade him to come aboard, while they tow Suv's vessel back to their island for repairs. The natives consider Suv to be lucky for bringing them the whale. Suv tells them that he heard the island was brimming with whales and wants to know if he can buy some. Gaira angrily tells him that the whales are sacred; and they have no intention of selling any to pirates. Zizi comes between them before matters can get anymore heated.</p><p>The natives hold a funeral ceremony for this killed by the leviathan. Zizi asks Suv where he comes from. He responds that he came from a long way south, and then asks Zizi why she wants to know. Zizi tells Suv to repair his ship as soon as possible, and she'll even help because she's going to come too. And she WON'T take no for an answer.</p><p>The natives have cut the whale open and extracted it's giant heart. To Suv's bemusement, they perform a ceremony and give the heart back to the Sakai. Afterwards, Suv comes across Zizi sitting next to a skimmer. She repeats that she's going with him, but Suv won't hear of it. She tells him that she can catch lots of whales for him, but Suv scoffs and tells her that she just got lucky. Zizi says that it was lucky for him, or he and his crew would have died. Suv reiterates that there's no way in hell that he's going to let Zizi leave with them. Zizi grunts and walks away. Later, Suv visits the location where the leviathan is being processed. He tries to speak to Gaira, but Gaira angrily tells him that he doesn't consort with pirates.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zizi is being prepared for her crimson tide ceremony the next day. Nene and her grandmother are excited because this ceremony will mark Zizi's transition to womanhood. Zizi, for her part, is annoyed.</p><p>Back at the whale processing station, the natives are shocked and horrified when a whale fetus or \"child treasure\" comes spilling out of the corpse. It's a major taboo in their culture to kill a pregnant leviathan. One of the workers becomes enraged and attacks Suv, blaming him for bringing the leviathan to them. Suddenly, another monstrous leviathan comes bursting out of the Sakai. Suv is excited, but Garai informs him that the whale is seeking revenge on the humans for killing his mate and unborn child. Suv is skeptical, until the whale starts to attack. Garai asks Suv if he's ready to fight, but Suv runs off. With his craft not ready yet, Suv and his crew board skimmers and hope to flee before the leviathan kills them. The whale starts to come after them, but suddenly Zizi comes rushing by on her own skimmer heading straight for the beast. She yells to Suv that if she kills this second whale that it will be skill and not luck. Suv yells back that she's crazy, but Zizi doesn't care. To Nene and Gaira's horror, she drives her skimmer straight into the creature's gaping maw and disappears. Suddenly the leviathan blows up like big balloon until **. Pieces of the whale go flying everywhere. Zizi emerges from the sand, covered in gore, but otherwise unhurt.</p><p>While Garai pulls Zizi out of the sand, and the other natives celebrate, Nene and Grandmother discuss the child treasure. The old woman tells Nene that ,for killing the pregnant whale, Zizi must be exiled. Nene protests, but her grandmother tells her that they cannot defy the will of the lord of the Sakai. Nene goes up to Zizi and tearfully gives her a hug. Zizi wonders what's wrong, but Nene won't tell her. Zizi declares to Nene that she needs to know where she comes form. Zizi swears that she will find it, even if she has to cross the whole Sakai.</p><p>The island natives throw their double celebration; celebrating both rescue from the leviathan, and Zizi's crimson tide ceremony. Zizi wears the ritual gown and enters the sacred room where men aren't allowed. She is told by a two attendants to step into a circle, as she does so she realizes that the circle is made of sand. Then, in a not-so subtle metaphor for menstruation, she is covered in whale's blood and her uterus begins to glow.</p><p>Meanwhile, Suv and his crew have returned to the island and face Gaira's scorn. Their vessel is almost repaired, but the natives have locked it up due to Suv's fleeing during the leviathan attack.</p><p>Back at the crimson tide ceremony, Zizi enters the tree of life. She sees a large group of stones, and a disembodied voice tells her to pick one. She wonders which one to pick, and eventually she chooses a small, black, smooth stone. The stone is warm to the touch. As she picks it up, she has a vision of a faraway rocky and cragged island. The voice tells Zizi that the stone is a part of her mother and father; it is her birthright. As the voice speaks, the stone is tied around Zizi's navel. She is told to carry the stone around her at all times because it will assure her safety.</p><p>The assembled crowd cheers as Zizi exits from the crimson tide ceremony. She tries to speak, but is interrupted by the grandmother. The old lady shouts that Zizi killed a treasure child and must be banished from the island. The crowd shouts their discontent, but Grandmother says the law is absolute. Suv and his crew sense the displeasure amongst the crowd and decide it's time they made their exit.</p><p>Nico manages to pick the locks holding their ship, and they prepare to shove off. Suv expresses some regret at Zizi's fate... until he realizes that she has also come aboard their vessel. He tries to force her to leave, but Zizi informs him that he abandoned his ship while trying to flee from the sand whale; therefore this is now HER ship. Nene comes running alongside the departing vessel, and manages to jump aboard; she is coming also, to keep an eye on Zizi. Frustrated, Suv allows them to stay. Suddenly, there's a loud clanging noise. Gaira has thrown his favorite harpoon at the moving vessel. Zizi sees him, and she realizes that he wasn't attacking them, he was giving her the harpoon.</p><p>As Suv's ship travels over the horizon, Grandma declares that Zizi may not have been born on the island, but she is their child.</p><p>It's been three days since they left the island, and ever since Zizi joined up, the ship has been followed by all manner of sand-sea creatures. Zizi loves it, but Nene is seasick, and Suv is annoyed. Suv tries to blast some of the creatures, but Zizi refuses to let him and blocks his shot. Suv asks her if the fish are ever going to leave them alone, but Zizi doesn't answer. Instead, she asks him about the Forgotten Continent where her parents were supposedly from. Suv tells her that if she wants to find it so bad, she should get off his ship and go jump on a whale. At that moment, a plume of sand rises causing the crew to think it's a sand geyser... until they become covered in whale blood. A whale explodes; Suv commands his crew to man their battlestations.</p><p>Aboard an ominous vessel, there stands a short, bald man dressed all in black. He is Commander Jango of the Imperial Fleet. An officer informs Jango that the whale pod has not altered course, and there also appears to be a fishing vessel amongst the pod. Jango wonders what a fishing vessel is doing way out there, and decides to teach them a lesson. His ship charges right at Suv's, but is slowed down when Zizi manages to hit it with a missile-spike(much to Suv's chagrin). Jango continues to plow towards them, but thanks to Nico's quick steering, they miss. As the ships pass each other, Jango drops several organic looking pods onto Suv's deck. Afraid that they're bombs, Suv orders his crew to throw them overboard, but the pods prove too heavy to move. Suddenly, the pods hatch and transform into lobster-men Crustaceans. Suv and his crew are outmatched and brought aboard Jango's vessel.</p><p>Suv tries to smooth-talk his way out of trouble, but Jango doesn't buy it. He tells Suv that he believes he and his crew to be enemies of the empire planning an uprising. Jango orders his men to kill their captives and scuttle their ship. Fortunately, Zizi(who had been hiding) jumps out and starts charging at Jango with Gaira's harpoon. A Crustacean steps in front of Jango to protect him; Zizi and the Crustacean battle. In all the confusion, Suv, Zizi, and the Crustacean are all knocked overboard. The Crustacean activates it's sand sensors, and prepares for an easy kill. It's shocked, however, when Zizi reveals that she can see inside the Sakai.</p><p>Jango rejoices as blood comes rising to the surface. He prepares to offer Nene to his crew as entertainment... until the dead lobster-man is thrown onboard. Zizi comes climbing out of the Sakai, carrying a passed-out Suv. She boastfully tells Jango that his Crustacean wouldn't have lasted five minutes as a whale hunter.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Episode 1: ZIZI The Witch With Pink Hair</li><li>Episode 2: The Magnificent Black Whale</li><li>Episode 3: Crimson Tide</li><li>Episode 4: Yellow-SUV-Marine</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>Alchemy: the mystical power to alter the natural world; something between magic, art, and science. When two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, dabbled in this power to grant their dearest wish, one of them lost an arm and a leg... and the other became nothing but a soul locked into a body of living steel. Now Edward is an agent of the government, a slave of the military-alchemical complex, using his unique powers to obey orders... even to kill. Except his powers aren't unique. The world has been ravaged by the abuse of alchemy. And in pursuit of the ultimate treasure, the Philosopher's Stone, their enemies are even more ruthless than they are...</i></p><p>Edward and Al are introduced in their plight to find the Philosopher's Stone. It all started when Ed and Alphonse were children and attempted to bring back their dead mother with Alchemy, something considered the biggest of all sins in their world. The results of this were catastrophic for them and their friends and family, and their father, Hohenheim, had already left years before. After they attempted bringing Trisha Elric, their mother, back to life, Ed was taken to the \"Truth\", which decided that as compensation for such a sin, that he would take Ed's leg. Alphonse, however, was not so lucky. Truth took his whole body and placed somewhere else within the Gate. Ed saw that his brother, his only remaining Family member, was gone, and that he had also gained information about Alchemy no one would ever think about, being able to transmute without a circle, for one. After he saw Al disappear, he drew transmutation circles all over his body, one on his heart, on on his head, and one on his arm, telling himself that he would willingly lose these body parts if it meant that Al could get brought back to life. Luckily, Ed only lost his right arm, and was able to transmute his brothers soul, something else thought unthinkable, into a nearby suit of armor, thus saving his life and soul, if only temporarily. The first chapter starts with The two alchemist, the second is The price of life, the third is The Mining Town, and the fourth is the Battle on the train.</p><p>Within these chapters a lot is shown about how Ed and Al react to certain things, and characters are introduced and this volume hands out the meat and potatoes of what FMA really is all about. Ed'd character is deeper than most main characters of an anime or manga, and he is extremely emotional about certain things and or memories. At first he comes off as a snot nosed kid, and then shows that he is smarter and more capable than most people get out of him. A stereotypical character, at least, that is at first. His role as the older brother is challenged a lot by the trials he faces in everyday life, and it scares him. Thoguh he may seem like a stereotypical character for a manga series, Ed shows that he actually has real emotions in the course of Fullmetal Alchemist volume I.</p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 1: The Two Alchemists</li><li>Chapter 2: The Price of Life</li><li>Chapter 3: The Mining Town</li><li>Chapter 4: Battle on the Train</li></ul>",

For Tower, it's going to be a HELL of a last day. This volume of horror, inspired by Konami's hit videogame series, is penned by Silent Hill scribe Scott Ciencin and illustrated by Nick Stakal (Hyde, Containment) and features a collaborative cover by Ben Templesmith and Alex Garner.</em></p>",

Nobody knows much about the young girl with a porcelain face and huge eyes framed by black bangs, and her ever-present brood of black cats only adds to the intrigue--but that hasn't stopped a generation of rabid fans from letting Emily put her spell upon them. Now, for the first time ever, Emily fans will be welcomed into her dark and, well, <em>strange</em> world--a place where kitty friends talk, the ghosts of famous weirdos come out to play, reality is never quite what it seems, and--above all--a place where anyone who's ever been considered a little \"strange\" themselves will be made to feel right at home.</p><p>Dark Horse Comics and the creative minds behind Cosmic Debris are thrilled to present the first-ever Emily comic books, published as deluxe single issues with all-new stories and art. Each issue of <em>Emily</em> comics features 48 pages of black, white, and red art (with the occasional outburst of full-color freakouts!), illustrating a wacky range of Emily stories.</p><p>Make sure to check out Emily's exclusive interview with punk rock legends, <strong><em>The Damned</em></strong>! And we're sure you'll get stuck on the 2 pages of special <strong><em>Emily stickers</em></strong> included in the back of the comic!</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>One of the most popular Batman creative teams ever reunites for a twice-monthly- shipping 6-issue miniseries! Writer Steve Englehart and artists Marshall Rogers &amp; Terry Austin set a high standard with their acclaimed run on DETECTIVE COMICS in the late 1970s! Now that team is back with BATMAN: DARK DETECTIVE, a miniseries that pits the Dark Knight against the most famous and feared members of his Rogues Gallery! In the startling debut issue, the Joker enters a gubernatorial election using the campain slogan \"Vote for me or I'll kill you!\" Will it persuade voters? Plus, Bruce Wayne's old love interest Silver St. Cloud returns, as do Two-Face and the Scarecrow! And the action continues in the startling second issue, as the Scarecrow manages to overcome Batman in the one location where he's most vulnerable: the Batcave! Meanwhile, the Bruce Wayne/Silver St. Cloud relationship heats up! Issue #1.</em></p><p>Batman checked out the security before attending a function as Bruce Wayne. Senator Evan Gregory was a man running for governor - Batman wanted to make sure he lived to see election day. Gregory wanted to make the Batman more \"legitimate.\" While speaking, Gregory introduced his fiancee - Silver St. Cloud. After an awkward moment, Silver introduced Bruce to Evan.</p><p>The Joker appeared and made his bid for governor - \"vote for me, or I'll kill you.\" He shook hands with Gregory and almost killed him with a rigged joy buzzer. Joker then demanded $1 million from everyone in attendance. Batman was quick to the punch, but Joker escaped cleanly. A police officer was found dead outside.</p><p>Note: Cover is a homage to the recruitment poster sporting Uncle Sam saying: I want you for U.S.Army</p>",

When the plan to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt falls apart, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, and Chewbacca embark on another rescue mission that puts them into direct conflict with Boba Fett. Meanwhile, Luke’s late arrival on Dagobah ends with him being captured by Darth Vader and the Emperor, just as the second Death Star is about to go on-line!

The rules of the Demon World are complicated and archaic though, and one of them, \"Don't fall in love with your target,\" looks like it might be a little too easy for Maeve to break, especially after she meets Aiden, a smart but unmotivated student at her new high school.<br /><br />Maeve discovers the joys of chicken-onion soup, art class, horror movies and living among humans, and soon she's more reluctant to fulfill her task than ever. Unfortunately for her, there's also something malevolent afoot in Erebus, the demon world, and Maeve is unwittingly right at the center of it. Between Aiden's witchy girlfriend, his nutty best friend, biology class, and Demon World conspiracies, Maeve is going to be lucky to make it out of high school alive.</i></p>",

One day, he finds an old bloodstained Go board in his grandfather's attic--and that's when things get really interesting. Trapped inside the Go board is Fujiwara-no-Sai, the ghost of an ancient Go master who taught the strategically complex board game to the Emperor of Japan many centuries ago. In one fateful moment, Sai becomes a part of Hikaru's consciousness and together, through thick and thin, they make an unstoppable Go-playing team. Will they be able to defeat Go players who have dedicated their lives to the game? Will Sai achieve the \"Divine Move\" so he'll finally be able to rest in peace?

She is thought by her aunt to have some sort of mental illness, as Dinah believes the house to be haunted. Only Dinah is aware of the restless spirits, which only feeds the doctor's and her aunt's suspicions about Dinah's well-being. The house was a mental hospital, then a school for juvenile delinquents. The ghosts know Dinah can see them and they won't leave her alone. A recluse, she sneaks out with her only friend, Vincent, and together they discover a lost graveyard. There they find a sunken mausoleum, where Dinah reads from a stone engraving. This act binds her to a contract requiring Dinah to release spirits stuck somewhere between an unhappy life and a peaceful afterlife. If she refuses, she will face an eternity of hell. So Dinah begins her quest of \"cleaning\" the vaults, crypts and graves of lost souls, all the while struggling with the haunts at home and suspicions of her growing mental illness.</i></p><h2>Chapter Titles</h2><ul><li>Chapter 01: \"The Sickness\"</li><li>Chapter 02: \"The Gilded Cage\"</li><li>Chapter 03: \"The Stranglehold\"</li><li>Chapter 04: \"The Coming Storm\"</li><li>Chapter 05: \"The Fairywaters\"</li><li>Chapter 06: \"The Wild Beast\"</li><li>Chapter 07: \"The Angel in Disguise\"</li></ul>",

A Midnight Opera is the story of two undead brothers Ein and Leroux DeLaLune, who are divided in this epic struggle and who are forced to reconcile their differences in the modern day to stop an open assault on mankind by the dissatisfied elements among the rest of the undead.<br /><br />Volume 1 focuses on Ein, who fled his brethren in the early 19th century only to surface early in the 21st century as an underground goth metal sensation. But with his newfound fame comes the exposure that brings all the demons from his past. And the Ein who wanted simply to pursue a life of music and love will find that he may have no other choice but to forsake both and assume the weight of all salvation on his shoulders.</i>",

This collection also contains a  sketchbook section showing Nguyen's early approach to Batman, the  Penguin and the Scarecrow.

When 15-year-old Kim Vesco moves from Chicago to Salem, MA, she finds that the local student body is divided into rival factions of witches and non-witches, with both sides bidding for her allegiance. And if that weren't enough, an unknown force seems to want her... dead! Between the tribal loyalties of the schoolyard and the brutal, fight-or-die logic of the mage-war, Kim has to steer a course that will keep her alive until she can take the fight back to her enemy and reveal the true identity of someone she thought she already knew: herself.

But around the globe, the very fabric of time is unraveling. Minutes are vanishing from days, and objects from the past are materializing in the present. When these chronal anomalies start multiplying like a virus, Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny decide to slip into the timestream to investigate. For seasoned adventurers like the FF, it should be a walk in the park, right? Guess again. Plus: It's good news all around - and not just for the FF, who have reclaimed their status as New York's premier super-hero team, but for their friend and ally, Alicia Masters. After a lifetime of darkness, the blind sculptress's eyesight has been restored by her father, Philip Masters - the seemingly reformed villain Puppet Master - but at what cost? Either all is as it seems... or darker forces are at work. Collects Marvel Knights 4 #13-18.</i></p>",

Originally presented in LaLa DX magazine from Hakusensha between 1998 to 2004, the 9-volume LAND OF THE BLINDFOLDED is the story of high school student Outsuka Kanade who can sometimes see a person's future with a touch, and transfer student Naitou Arou, whose ESP is limited to past events. When Kanade glimpses an unfortunate incident coming, can she change it? She soon befriends Arou, who's no novice — he can turn his ability on or off at will, even using it to see an object's \"memories.\" Are these teenaged seers of the past and future made for each other? And who's right: Arou with his \"hands off\" policy about meddling in people's lives, or Kanade whose more proactive stance has already had unhappy consequences?</i></p><p>Chapter 1 - 3.</p><h2>Additional Stories</h2><ul><li>After the Festival</li><li>The Mistaken Man</li></ul>",

            "description": "<p><i>For years, Tim Kreider's cartoons (as collected in 2004's <b>The Pain: When Will It End?</b>) were single-panel non-sequiturs in the tradition of B. Kliban, about the squalor and ridiculousness of the human condition. But after the takeover by the Bush-Cheney regime and the War on Terror, he focused his bitter humor on more timely issues. His political cartoons have been, in the words of Ted Rall (not known as a sentimental softie), \"among the most viscerally anti-Bush work around.\" As reality has become ever more nightmarish, Kreider's been driven to push the outer limits of humor to parody it. In this collection you will find: The Girls of Hamas calendar, the artist's conception of \"Negropolis\" (Strom Thurmond's proposal for a lunar colony for the repatriation of African-Americans), John Ashcroft imagining eating Donald Rumsfeld as their bunker crumbles around them, and U.S. jets bombing the Great Pyramids in the War on Horror. Cynical, astute, blackly hilarious, and deeply biased, these cartoons are neither the superficial, obvious jibes that appear in your daily paper's editorial section nor the didactic left-wing rants syndicated in your local alternative weekly; they are the artistic equivalent of hollow-point bullets fired from a high-powered rifle with a laser sight directly into the brain of the Bush administration. With an introduction by Mark Crispin Miller, author of <b>The Bush Dyslexicon</b> and <b>Cruel and Unusual</b>.</i></p>",

The screams of his lady friends from several blocks away!</em></p><p><em>SMELL! Fred the Clown's scientifically improbable collection of fungal infections!</em></p><p><em>The signature creation of cartoonist Roger Langridge, Fred the Clown is the thinking man's idiot. Fred has an eye for the ladies, as well as several other organs, but the only part of themselves they're willing to share with him is a carefully placed kneecap...</em></p><p><em>Fred the Clown's misadventures are a curious balance of bleakness and joyful absurdism; the universe may dump on Fred from a great height, but he never gives up. More often than not, they involve the pursuit of a lady—any lady will do, it seems, but bearded ladies are at the top of the list. Disappointment seems inevitable, and it usually is; yet, almost despite himself, Langridge will occasionally give Fred a happy ending out of nowhere...</em></p><p><em>Langridge's comics betray a restless stylistic playfulness, a pessimism about human nature, and an absurdist perspective on human folly that can be traced back through Monty Python, The Goon Show and even as far back as Lewis Carroll. Fred the Clown's visual look often harks back to earlier eras, evoking the styles of (among others) Max Fleischer cartoons, classic newspaper strips, 19th-century illustration, the children's books of Maurice Sendak and Doctor Seuss, and more. The sensibility, though, is thoroughly modern—no classic style goes unsubverted, no narrative is left without ending in emotional ambiguity or a pomposity-puncturing ironic gag. Underlying it all is Langridge's own meticulous brush style. According to another New Zealand cartoonist, Hicksville creator Dylan Horrocks, \"If Samuel Beckett had teamed up with the Goons and learned to draw like Tex Avery, the result would have been something very like the comics of Roger Langridge.\"</em></p>",

The Freebooters is amongst the most raucous and literate comics of Windsor-Smith's career, the culmination of a lifetime of experience and knowledge, approaching his comics with a seriousness of purpose while never losing his unmistakable sense of humor.

The unbelievably brave Dragon Knight and her courageous Prince faced an evil Wizard that threatened the entire land. But before they could finish the chapter, Aeslin's parents left on a business trip. When her father died on that trip, it was time for Aeslin to stop living in a fantasy world.

She has a crush on Michael, the most popular boy in school, and her best friend Samantha loves to trade secrets and share gossip. It's a fine, if not extraordinary, existence until Samantha happens on a new book - Once In A Blue Moon. It's a sequel to the novel Aeslin loved as a child. The new pages catch up on the denizens of Avalon and their miserable eight-year existence since the defeat of the Dragon Knight. Aeslin can't believe it. She wishes she could be there to defend all of the creatures and common folk she loved as a child. And then out of nowhere, she is... Now Aeslin has the opportunity to be the hero she always admired. But Avalon is a much more dangerous place than she remembered and there's no instruction manual she can read to figure out what to do or how to get home.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>This October, John Carpenter brings one of his most original nightmares back to the big screen with a remake of <strong>The Fog</strong>, starring <strong>Smallville's</strong> Superboy Tom Welling. Carpenter and director Rupert Wainwright (<strong>Stigmata</strong>) team with Dark Horse Comics to flesh out the story of doomed travelers and the supernatural devastation of a small coastal town, in this original graphic novel.</em></p><p><em>Scott Allie, writer of <strong>The Devil's Footprints</strong> and <strong>Star Wars: Empire</strong> worked with the director to craft a bizarre story about a Chinese curse and a town plunged into a walking-dead nightmare. A group of Shanghai traders have come to America hoping to escape a string of weird deaths at the claws of unseen monsters. The arrival of a strange yet familiar fog reveals that the curse has found them, but even they don't know what that has to do with a pyromaniac refugee from the Civil War, the disappearance of one of their sons, or the terrible change coming over the Americans in this small seaside town.</em></p><p><em>With a cover by <strong>Hellboy</strong> creator Mike Mignola and haunting art by Todd Herman (<strong>The Dark Horse Book of the Dead</strong>) and Dave Stewart (<strong>Conan</strong>, <strong>Hellboy</strong>), this original graphic novel is an essential intro to the new film.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Tim Kreider's cartoons, previously seen only in the Baltimore City Paper, have attracted a cult following for their razor-sharp intelligence and unprecedented viciousness. His manic, spontaneous line, and his eye for facial expression, gesture, and detail make his cartoons more than one-shot gags. His humor is both erudite and puerile, as personally revealing as a drunken blackout and as politically trenchant as a lone gunman. Kreider's work has been likened to the foul result of inbreeding between Ralph Steadman and B. Kliban. The wide range of subject matter in this collection covers religion and politics to Nietzsche and pie, from sex and violence to the sheer pointlessness of it all.</em></p>",

Come all . . . to the exciting world of Big Top! Rob Harrell's three-ring comic strip has already packed the house with fans eager for his hilarious take on the circus and those who bring it to life. The circus and its colorful cast-led by 10-year-old Pete and his happily reformed performing bear, Wink-are a perfect metaphor for life. It's not always what happens on the surface, Big Top reminds us, but what takes place backstage that delivers the lessons and the humor. Pete and Wink keep plenty of odd company, including Kingston, coolest king of the jungle; Stucco, a mute clown who still manages to make his point; Manfred, the bookish monkey; Dusty, the wisecracking tell-it-like-it-is trained poodle; Andrea, the new acrobat girl who's caught Pete's eye; and Hairy Mary the Bearded Lady, a mother figure to them all. Take this crew on the road and you get an endless array of situations and relationships, care and impatience, honesty and intolerance. It's like one big Big Top family . . . one that welcomes all readers for the mere price of a ticket.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Darrin Bell's Candorville is an insightful comic strip for today's world. Brutally honest but still evenhanded, Candorville takes on some of society's toughest issues, giving readers something to think about--as well as smirks, chuckles, and guffaws. Another Stereotype Bites the Dust is a collection of creator Darrin Bell's Candorville cartoon strip. In this thought-provoking strip Bell uses a diverse group of friends to paint a real yet humorous portrait of inner-city America. An educated underachiever, Lemont Brown is an aspiring writer. Socially conscious, he wants to work at changing the world and infusing it with wisdom and justice--if only he could pay his rent. Lemont's childhood friend Susan Garcia is a book-smart and street savvy Mexican-American woman who won't let bigotry or any glass ceiling keep her down. And Lemont's friend Clyde (aka C-Dog) is a streetwise thug and undiscovered rapper who'd rather mooch off his mother than get a job. Another Stereotype Bites the Dust deals with some tough issues--poverty, homelessness, racism, and personal responsibility--with knowing irony and incisive satire. Bell uses edgy dialogue and modern situations to jab everything from political correctness to political spinning, from political hindsight to office politics, making it a hit with the socially aware.</em></p>",

La Cucaracha (aka Cuco Rocha) and his pals voice the concerns and observations of the Latino-American community with an edgy, insightful wit. Through La Cucaracha, creator Lalo Alcaraz makes blunt social commentary both hard-hitting and hilarious. The result is not just a pleasure, but also a craving. The strong undercurrent of modern Latino themes and issues adds a sharp layer of meaning to the humor. In one strip, an immigrant bartender has listened to two customers rant, \"I'm telling ya, there's too many immigrants pouring into this country.\" When one of the customers asks for another drink the bartender declares, \"I'm an immigrant, and guess what? I'm not pouring!\" This first of perceptive La Cucaracha humor will delight and gratify all audiences that appreciate intelligent, progressive, deeply amusing comics.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>My cartoons are my best appraisal of a situation presented in the funniest or most compelling way I can. Read my cartoons. What I have to say is in them. It's been a decade since political cartoonist Tom Toles collected his panels in book form. He's had a busy decade and plenty of time to further sharpen both his wit, commentary, and pen. NOW Who Do We Blame? presents an editorial master at the top of his game, in all of his whimsical, sometimes scathing, and always insightful glory. Toles, editorial cartoonist for the Washington Post, includes his favorite frames from the past. His subjects include the 9/11 Commission, the 2004 presidential election, terrorism, the Middle East conflict, Yasser Arafat, Afghanistan, Iraq, and of course George W. Bush. The collection title, in fact, comes from a panel showing Bush at his desk, covered with miniatures of the GOP White House, GOP Senate, GOP House, and GOP Supreme Court. Now who do we blame? asks the puzzled Commander in Chief. Such is the humor, satire, and intelligence of one of the most accomplished and widely read political cartoonists working today. Toles, who draws himself as the artist working in the lower right corner of his panels, takes on every issue and every powerbroker that crosses the national screen.</em></p>",

Especially if you're a dog. Pooch Cafe is the home away from home for Poncho and his canine buddies. No Collar, No Service marks the second collection of the hip hit strip Pooch Cafe, named for the place where Poncho, Boomer, and the rest of their pals regularly gather to discuss life among the humans and to hatch their plans to catapult all the world's cats into space. But you won't find this spot on Main Street. Its actual location is a canine secret compromised just once when they tried to get a pizza delivered. Poncho is as passionate about his love for his master, Chazz, as he is about his distaste for kitties. When Poncho and Chazz move in with Carmen and her medley of cats, Poncho pals up with \"Fish,\" a goldfish who conveniently speaks dog, to learn the lay of the land. Poncho views his master's new life as a threat to the sacred man-dog bond, despite Carmen's efforts to make peace with Poncho using love, tenderness, and cheese. Good thing there's always the gang at the cafe. No Collar, No Service is the saga of a strip that captures the intensity of the human-dog bond in a way that resonates with pet lovers everywhere.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>The cult classic is back in print! Sam Henderson's 1996 collection of his early mini-comics is available once again with this digital release. See what his work liked like back when he was poor(er). Introduction by Mark Martin. \"There are something like 50-60 strips here, with the longest being seven or eight pages. The brevity suits Henderson and his style of savage, biting, sarcastic humor. Henderson realizes the subject matter often doesn't merit more than one brutal kick-in-the-ass punchline. Some of the best sections feature several one-panel comics on a single page or two-page spread. This isn't moronic humor; Henderson knows what he's doing and some of the more satisfying bits of this book are those strips where he pulls apart and analyzes the humor involved or simply acknowledges a strip's abrupt vapidity. Better critics than myself have been screaming about Henderson for years, including a number of recommendations right here. With this attractive, meaty tome, you no longer have an excuse to ignore them.\" ~Tom Spurgeon, The Comics Journal Sam Henderson's Magic Whistle comic has been nominated for the last 4 years in a row for a Harvey Award for Special Award for Humor. One of the funniest people in comics is Sam Henderson. Henderson's drawing is intentionally crude, but it has the same kind of energy you see in the work of today's best gag cartoonists, whose drawing also tends to be a little basic. Extremely low-brow humor that almost parodies low-brow humor -- it's enjoyable on either level. Over the years Sam has done work for many dozens of anthologies, has done a self-syndicated comic strip and published comic Magic Whistle, now through Alternative Comics. Sam was also recently a writer of a number of Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon shows.</em></p>",

Lauren Moore is a brilliant young scientist and the creator of Cloudburst: a massive satellite designed to control rainfall on dry planets. Onboard a new colony ship carrying several hundred families, soldiers and cryogenically stored animal embryos, Lauren has been commissioned to use Cloudburst to terraform the planet. What Lauren doesn't know is the soldiers escorting the ship have been sent to remove the existing colonists to make room for the new ones. The corporate term is eviction. The human term is mass murder. The only man who can help her is a mysterious drifter who some say is only a myth, an invention of desert nomads and lunatics.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em><strong>Trigun</strong> is a manga and anime sensation, sweeping America with its conflicted and funny characters, frantic action, and a style that defies age barriers. Of the two most noticeable characters in <strong>Trigun</strong>, Wolfwood plays the foil against Vash the Stampede, with his negative view of humanity and gigantic cross-like gun, this fighting priest is far from docile. This twenty-five cent, right-to-left reading comic centers on Wolfwood's dark character, and introduces the reader to the second volume of the <strong>Trigun</strong> Anime Manga series from Dark Horse Comics. Will Wolfwood ever understand Vash's desire to never kill another human? Will he be able to protect our red-coated hero from dying himself? Time will tell. Get your introduction to the gunslinging man of the cloth with 24 pages of brilliant color and bountiful action.</em></p>",

In this volume, Helen's triumphant entry into Troy is marred by Kassandra's wild prophecies of doom. Meanwhile, a massive army approaches from across the sea, but a disastrous battle forces the High King Agamemnon to make a fateful decision. Will he command the death of his daughter to satisfy the gods? Or will he give up his dream of conquering Troy? The drama and action continue in the book that the editors of Publishers Weekly choose as one of the best books of 2004. Collects AGE OF BRONZE #10-19.</em></p>",

To remedy the situation, he promises his daughter's hand in marriage to a businessman named Alexander. However, this is not just an engagement, it's also a business deal. The purpose of this marriage is for a male heir. If one is born, then Alexander must deliver the boy to Mia's father, and in exchange Alexander will receive an entire island in the Aegean Sea. This arrangement that so resembles slavery makes Alexander angry, and the fact that Mia does exactly as her father says has him looking on both her and her father with disgust. Mia, however despicable the situation, complies with her father's wishes...</em></p>",

Demons! exploded the comic book medium, ending up on “Best Of” lists from Time Magazine and the Chicago Tribune. In these seventeen vignettes that touch on the scent of people's homes, why babies are the best dancers, and how pretentious exboyfriends are like head lice, Barry brings her demons out to be exorcised. Described as “brutally honest, thoughtful and soulful” by Nick Hornby in the New York Times, One! Hundred! Demons! takes on Barry's childhood with humor and poignancy.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>This is a true story about the most interesting person you've never heard of: Arthur Cravan, major figure in pre-WWI cutting-edge art circles, was among the greatest mysterious figures of the Twentieth Century. A self-confessed thief, forger, and con-artist, he used a roster of assumed names and false identities. He was known, at various times, as a novelist, poet, painter, art critic, lecturer, publisher, and the lightweight boxing champion of France. Always a rebellious, restless spirit, this dedicated rule-breaker was a political radical whose friendship with Leon Trotsky earned him the surveillance of the U.S. government-even through his immigration to Mexico with his wife, the poet Mina Loy. In 1918, at the age of thirty-one, the fascinating physical giant vanished without a trace, and-despite several supposed sightings over the years-was never seen again. Is it possible that he became the mysterious, reclusive novelist B. Traven, who wrote <strong>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</strong>?</em></p>",
