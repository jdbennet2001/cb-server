            "description": "<p><em></em>The concluding chapter of the much-heralded Millar/Hitch tenure on Ultimates has finally arrived! All the running plot lines come to their cataclysmic end in these pages as the Team Supreme puts everything they’ve got into a grand finale that will take its place alongside the finest comics of the past decade. Alliances are made and relationships are severed in a tale you simply cannot miss. You have been warned! Part 7 (of 6) </p><p>In Norway, Thor battles against doctors that are trying to sedate him. His worried brother comes to him and tells him he needs to take his medicine so he stops believing he's a god. Thor knows this is all a trick though, an illusion created by his brother Loki. He's not really in Norway, he's in Washington, in the middle of battle. He slowly breaks free of Loki's spell and the real world comes into view. As soon as it does, Thor raises his hammer and brings it down on Loki, killing him. </p><p>Or so everyone thinks. As the Ultimates gather around to congratulate Thor, Loki gets up, saying that a hammer can't stop a being who can basically rewrite the universe. To show them what he means, Loki summons dragons, giant wolves, ogres, giants, and all sorts of monsters from Norse lore. While Captain America commands everyone to fall back, Thor continues to battle Loki. He tells his evil brother that his powers are weakening, but Loki disagrees. He says that hiding and planning was weak, but now he knows that he should have been brave. Should not have been afraid of Odin, and now, he's enjoying his fight with Thor. He's enjoying putting Thor on his knees. As Thor recovers from being beaten down by a swarm of Loki's, he tells his brother that he didn't come alone.</p><p>In the skies above, a rainbow appears and seems to fly to the battlefield. Upon closer inspection, countless vikings are seen riding the rainbow into battle. On the ground when the vikings show up as reinforcement, Hawkeye says he's sorry for ever doubting Thor. Captain America sees the warriors too, and tells all the heroes to get back into the battle.</p><p>The fight between Loki and Thor has turned and now Thor is in control. As he strikes his enemy, Loki admits that he was jealous. Then he starts talking about the humorous side of all the damage he's caused. Thor shuts him up with a hit from his hammer that calls down lightning so powerful that the impact is seen for miles around. </p><p>After the blow, Loki is nowhere to be seen. The skies clear, the battle stops, and Thor states that the planet is now under his protection. </p><p>During the clean up after the epic struggle, heroes from all over come to help. Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and even heroes from other parts of the world lend a hand. In the middle of it all, Tony Stark drinks. </p><p>Back at the site of the fight between Thor and Loki, the Ultimates congratulate Thor and show that they no longer doubt that he is a true god. Jan kiss Thor and Quicksilver recounts his favorite part of the battle, when Jan turned into a giant. Hank says that it was thanks to his formula. Captain America spots him and tells him that there will be consequences for his crimes. Hank plays off his turning traitor as a ploy to infiltrate the enemy and the whole thing seems forgotten. Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch flirts with one of the Ultron robots.</p><p>The news reports the battle, its end, the clean up and the consequences. Captain America walks with his evil counterpart's body as it's transported to the lab, but stops to talk with Nick Fury. The Ultimates will be going neutral. They'll be an independent unit, not under the control of the US anymore. Elsewhere, Thor talks with the rest of the team about the same thing, and Jan wonders how they'll pay for it without the support of a government. Just then, billionaire Tony Stark flies up in his Iron Man suit, and Thor says that his father works in mysterious ways.</p><p>In a nearby hospital, the Black Widow recovers. She had survived Tony Starks nanites by slitting her wrists and letting them flow out with her blood. She'd been found and saved, but now Hawkeye was coming for her. She tries to run but Hawkeye pins her to the wall with his arrows. She insults him one more time by bringing up his dead family right before he sends a third arrow through her face.</p><p>In Tony Stark's townhouse, he goes over changes being made to turn it into the new Ultimates HQ. He also explains to his assistant how the team going independent frees the US up to sign the superhuman test ban treaty. He goes to his own room and starts to cry over Black Widow when he sees a girl on the street through his window and he quickly gets over his broken heart.</p><p>At the Triskellion, Hank Pym is locked in the cage that previously housed Bruce Banner and Thor.</p><p>In a flashback to 1942, Steve Rogers walks with his girlfriend after going to a movie. They talk about what the experiment hes going to be a part of and Steve assures Gail that he'll be fine. He'll be more than fine, he'll be a hero. He promises that he'll be back right after the war, and they kiss.</p><p><em>The Ultimates Volumes One and Two were dedicated with love to Stan and Jack.</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Final Issue! A death in the Flash family!</em></p><p>The Flash must make the choice he was offered at the beginning of \"Full Throttle.\" And you won't want to miss the stunning full version of this cover — but you only can catch it when this issue races into stores!</p><p>The year is 2989 and Bart Allen is losing races in his virtual reality childhood. He asks his grandpa Barry why he keeps losing and Barry forces him to give his own answer. When Bart says it’s because it feels like his legs are gone after he runs too long, Barry tells him he just has to make his legs <em>not</em> hurt. Barry asks him what he wants to be when he grows up and Bart says he wants to be a hero. Barry says that a hero is just someone who stands up when their legs are gone.</p><p>In the present Valerie and Iris prepare for what’s coming, Inertia getting the speed force and the process blowing up half the area. Valerie is having a hard time with the machine but Iris tells her to keep working because, thanks to a time flux, there’s a chance they can save Bart. She then leaves Iris and heads out to help the powerless Bart.</p><p>At the moment, Bart is staring down the Black Flash with his Rogues coming up too. Iris appears and throws some sort of bomb at them to distract them while she tells Bart her plan. He smiles and tells her he’ll by Val all the time she needs, but Iris tries to stop him, saying she can take him away and keep him safe. In response, Bart puts her in a chokehold and puts her on the ground. He then calls Valerie and tells her he’ll get her the ten minutes she needs.</p><p>Nearby, Inertia watches as the Rogues try to get their bearings back. He doesn’t know that Piper is behind him. Piper knocks him out and says that Inertia wasn’t the only one with a secret agenda.</p><p>Flash uses a tranq gun to lower the number of rogues he’s facing, but there are still four of them after his ammo runs out. He tries to go hand to hand but being outnumbered makes it too hard. Bart goes down just as the Piper drags Inertia to the rest of the Rogues. With the two powerless speedsters side by side, Kadabra notices the similarities. He figures out that Inertia is Flash’s twin and that the whole thing was just a plan for him to get Flash’s speed. The Rogues are furious but Inertia says that, though the plan was for him, the Rogues still get what they wanted. A chance to kill Flash. Kadabra says that the boy in front of them is not Flash, but Flash breaks free and tells them otherwise. Surprising even himself, Bart attacks and Inertia and prepares to beat him to death in order to appease Black Flash and rewrite his history. Inertia fights back and starts heading for the machine so he can get the Speed Force. Flash gets up too and without either of them having super speed, they get into foot race. Before they can make it, the Rogues attack with all their weapons and both runners go down. Fortunately though, the whole thing bought Valerie enough time to finish what she was doing. The Rogues leave and Valerie and Iris run to the fallen Flash’s side. Flash says he loves Valerie right before he dies.</p><p>Heroes that were friends of Bart get the news of his death and don’t take it well. A memorial is made for Flash and hundreds of people are in attendance.</p><p>List of covers and their creators:</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Cover</th><th scope=\"col\">Name</th><th scope=\"col\">Creator(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Sidebar Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reg</td><td>Regular Cover</td><td>Tony Daniel</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Variant</td><td>Variant Cover</td><td>Tony Daniel</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>",

            "description": "<p>Bzzt, now joining the hunt for Guy Gardner on Mogo begins to search in the \"therapy area\". They didn't have to search far because Guy found them first. They attempted to take him into custody when Guy states that there's something happening to Mogo. Something strange, normally when you head to the therapy section Mogo helps to ease your pain but this time it was quite the opposite. Mogo appears to enrage your deepest fears in an attempt to brainwash every Lantern that enters. Isamot confirms this when he speaks of Green Man emmerging from the forrest acting strange.</p> <p>Guy claims that there are insects in the therapy area which may have been corrupting those who enter. Bzzt, being an insect himself, takes notice to this statement as many of the insects in this sector are his close relatives. Therefore, Bzzt wants to further investigate this claim himself and heads for the therapy area. Once he arrives he notices that they are not insects but fungal spores surrounding the grove. <br /></p> <p>Anticipating that something was wrong before the trio arrived, Guy called ahead for a doctor (Soranik) to come and check out the specimens. Soranik confirms that the spores are from out of this world and concludes that there must be a mother spore somewhere deeper in the forrest. Mogo is sick :( All five of the lanterns head off into the forrest to seek out this mother spore. Soranik states that anyone that comes in direct contact with the spore will hallucinate and if ingested will have nightmares forever. Each puts up their shield and begins the search. <br /></p> <p>Soranik contacts Oa to get the last known entrants into Mogo. The results are in: Tanakata Z, Green Man, and Kilowog! Kilowog appears and threatens to enact justice by killing Guy for the murder of Tanakata Z and Quord. Isamot and Vath vow to hold Kilowog back while Guy and Soranik try to take out the mother spore in hopes of stopping all of this hallucinating. Soranik claims if she can examine someone infected with the spores she can get a good idea how to cure this illness. Bzzt offers to sting Kilowog enought to incapacitate him so Soranik can examine him. Guy gives the go ahead. <br /></p> <p>They all corner and subdue Kilowog while Bzzt innoculates him. With Kilowog now knocked out Soranik begins her examination. Sure enough Soranik finds an infection and it's surrounding his brain, Just as Lantern Natu begins to work on him, he vomits a rather large yellow sentient being. Kilowog begins to regain conciousness.</p> <p>Now the concern turns toward Mogo. They fear if the infection continues to bore for his core he will be beyond cure. Mogo warns the Lanterns to leave his surface and NOW! Mogo has altered his orbit to become in the way of a rather large incoming asteroid. If the asteroid strikes his surface it is his hope that it will burn the infection out of his person. The asteroid strikes the surface.</p> <p>Back on Oa, Guy, Green Man, and Kilowog are cleared of all wrong doing due to the various effects of the viral infection. <br /></p> <p>Soranik returns to Mogo to ensure that the infection has been sterilized. It is confirmed, it is all gone. Bzzt vows to stick behind to help protect Mogo until he is properly healed.<br /></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Overview</i></p><p>In the aftermath of Amazons Attack, Wonder Woman tries to find her place in Man's world.  Protesters gather at the museum that Helena Sandsmark works demanding the removal of their Themysciran exhibit. As the Washington works on healing, Wonder Woman must decide what her role will be.</p><p>Wonder Woman is fighting a Hydra and at the Department of Meta Human Affairs, Nemesis is getting excited over Wonder Woman's new win against the Hydra. Sarge Steel then interrupts, asking them whether they have work to do regarding the location of the Amazons. Nemesis replies that they are; they are watching Wonder Woman but Sarge Steels ends the joke by telling him to look for Wonder Girl. Sarge Steel speaks highly for the search of Wonder Girl as he doesn't like \"loose cannon half-breed 'championns'.\"</p><p>Diana Prince comes in with the takeaway food they ordered and Sarge Steel explains to Diana Prince about the Wonder Girl situation. He explains that the Amazons need to be put in their place and Nemesis adds that some people agree with him because a protest is happening outside where Helena Sandsmark works. Nemesis adds that her mother is inside and that this could get ugly. Diana Prince acts on it when Sarge Steel leaves and Nemesis asks where she is going. She replies that she is going to go get the drink that she forgot to buy before.</p><p>She does her signature swirl and makes her way to the protestors in the front of the museum. Outside, the protestors want the Amazon feature gotten rid of and are circulating a petition to close the Themysciran exhibit. Things are looking grim as three of the major sponsers want the exhibition closed down as well. It turns out everyone's scared of them as the Teen Titans had taken down the internment camp and Air Force One. Cassie's thinking gets her into trouble with her mother as Helena believes that she's not thinking straight and the both of them get into a petty argument about spending time with each other and Cassie apologises for endangering innocents. She then plans that her mother should move away from here and grab some Amazon gear for protection.</p><p>Just outside, Wonder Woman lands and people scurry out of the way for her. The reporter is brave enough to start asking her questions, but she turns around to look at the crowd and they all run off. Wonder Woman runs into the Helena's assistant and she asks where they have gone. He replies that they went off but he has no idea where they went.</p><p>In Washington DC, various superheroes are helping rebuild a hospital after the war. Wonder Woman stops to check in and Wildcat reminds her of a reopening ceremony she has to go to. He then asks about Polly, otherwise known as Hippolyta and saddens Wonder Woman in the process. Alan Scott reminds Wildcat about the status of their relationship, which isn't too good now.</p><p>Wonder Woman then flies off to the ceremoney and there, Black Canary is cutting the ribbon. The students of the school cheer and three girls approach Wonder Woman, where two of the girls explain to Wonder Woman that one of their friends is the biggest fan of Wonder Woman, but is apparently very shy. Wonder Woman says hello and asks a question, much to the surprise of her friends. She asks, \"You won't leave us again, will you? You'll protect us... protect us like you did during the war?\" Wonder Woman says, \"Yes. Yes, I am\" and the both of them hug.</p><p>Wonder Woman flies above Themyscira and explains that the opposite of war isn't peace, but creation. Whatever is destroyed during the war, the rebuilding must begin, but that isn't the case for Wonder Woman as Hippolyta still chooses to block her own daughter out and is shutting her out like the island itself. However, she believes that she still must fight for what is right, that she is a champion of peace, an Amazon... she is <strong><em>Wonder Woman</em></strong>!</p>",
