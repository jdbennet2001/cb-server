All of them are printed with the same design: a distinctive shield, emblazoned with a stylized “S”.</p><p>***</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4060-56299\" href=\"/daily-star/4060-56299/\">The Daily Star</a>.</p><p>Editor-in-Chief <a data-ref-id=\"4005-23939\" href=\"/george-taylor/4005-23939/\">George Taylor</a> meets with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\">Clark Kent</a>, an aspiring young writer and the son of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3617\" href=\"/jonathan-kent/4005-3617/\">an old friend</a>. Taylor offers Kent a job. “It’s your turn to show the world what you can do.”</p><p>***</p><p>Clark Kent has been in <a data-ref-id=\"4020-41184\" href=\"/metropolis/4020-41184/\">Metropolis</a> for three months and has finally found a place of his own. In the meantime, he’s been staying with his pal <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3213\" href=\"/jimmy-olsen/4005-3213/\">Jimmy Olsen</a>, a photographer at the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55695\" href=\"/daily-planet/4020-55695/\">Daily Planet</a>.</p><p>Olsen would like nothing more than to earn some respect as a photo-journalist, but until now he’s made his living selling pictures of pretty girls. He manages his rent thanks to the guilt of his wealthy father.</p><p>Kent, for his part, would like nothing more than to meet <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\" href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\">Lois Lane</a>, a reporter at the Daily Planet whose work he greatly admires. “She writes like she doesn’t care who she upsets. Reading Lois Lane is like watching a martial arts display.”</p><p>***</p><p>On the roof of the court building, Angus “Guns” Grundig puts in a call to Mr. Metropolis himself, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81021\" href=\"/glen-glenmorgan/4005-81021/\">Glen Glenmorgan</a>. Acting as Glenmorgan’s muscle, he and his masked thugs have tracked down a policewoman who plans to testify against their boss, and Glenmorgan gives them orders to kidnap her.</p><p>Just then, the three armed criminals are interrupted by a brave young man. He wears a bright red cape, and his t-shirt is marked with a distinctive shield design, a large red and yellow “S,” bold across his chest.</p><p>Grundig threatens to shoot.</p><p>The young man dares him to.</p><p>The criminals open fire, and the young man just laughs as their bullets bounce off his indestructible cape. Then he demands that they let the policewoman go.</p><p>Their reply comes in the form of a rocket-powered grenade, aimed straight at his chest.</p><p>The grenade impacts and explodes, driving him off the rooftop and into the alley below. Somehow he survives, but Grundig and his thugs escape.</p><p>The young man lies in the alleyway, unconscious, where is found by a boy named Luke. Seeing an opportunity, he steals the man’s red cape, fleeing the scene before he regains consciousness.</p><p>***</p><p>While on the trail of “Guns” Grundig, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen bear witness to the amazing acts of this caped crusader. They rush back to their editor with the story, but all they can provide is an unbelievable tale and a few blurry photographs.</p><p>“This is the Daily Planet, not the Tattler,” their editor <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1809\" href=\"/perry-white/4005-1809/\">Perry White</a> tells them. “What’s next: ‘God Found Dead In Cleveland’?”</p><p>They insist, however. This is real, and it’s news.</p><p>He challenges them to prove it.</p><p>***</p><p>Young Luke returns home. His father is angry. He beats Luke’s mother. He threatens Luke’s little brother with a knife.</p><p>Clad in the cape of a hero, Luke finally has the courage to stand up to his abusive father. Enraged, his father tries to stab him. The knife crumples harmlessly against the indestructible cape. His father charges again, and Luke lands a solid blow through the cape, knocking his father to the ground.</p><p>Then he runs, his little brother close behind...</p><p>***</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-82299\" href=\"/mrs-nyxly/4005-82299/\">Mrs. Nyxly</a> shows Clark Kent his new apartment, and she knows he’s going to love it. The building she owns is largely inhabited by artists, musicians, models. “This is Boho Central,” she jokes.</p><p>As they talk, Kent gets to know her better. She talks about her nephew, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31328\" href=\"/ferlin-nyxly/4005-31328/\">Ferlin</a>, who curates the music museum. She talks about her husband, the stage magician “<a data-ref-id=\"4005-27436\" href=\"/mr-mxyzptlk/4005-27436/\">Mystic Mr. Triple X</a>.” He’s been in a coma for seven years, after <a data-ref-id=\"4005-86373\" href=\"/vyndktvx/4005-86373/\">a rival magician</a> messed with one of his tricks.</p><p>She leaves to let him settle in. He only has a small bag with him, though, so it doesn’t take long. He zips off his hoodie...</p><p>Underneath, his t-shirt bears a distinctive “S”.</p><p>***</p><p>Luke and his brother Paulie make their way to the Metropolis trainyards, convinced that nothing can hurt them now that they have the hero’s cape.</p><p>Their father soon arrives to test that theory.</p><p>Not far away, Jimmy Olsen brings Lois Lane to Hob’s Bay, hoping to introduce her to Kent. She’s enjoyed his blog, after all, and he knows she’ll come to like Kent as he has.</p><p>Lane’s senses as a reporter soon draw her attention to the confrontation between the two young boys and their drunk, angry father. The man charges at his sons, driving them out onto the rails.</p><p>Driving them into the path of an oncoming train.</p><p>The man pulls Paulie off the tracks, but Luke’s foot gets stuck and he can’t escape. Their father forces Paulie to watch in horror as the scene unfolds. Luke does his best to be brave as the train barrels down on him...</p><p>It stops less than a foot away, brought to a halt by the man with the “S”.</p><p>Luke returns his cape. Jimmy Olsen takes his picture. Lois Lane has her story.</p><p>Before he leaves, young Luke asks him what the “S” stands for. As the sun sets on Metropolis, Lois Lane answers his question in the pages of the Daily Planet.</p><p>She dubs this mysterious stranger “Superman.”</p><p><i>***</i></p><p><b><i>Origin of the Species</i></b></p><p>Years ago...</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-85534\" href=\"/erik-drekken/4005-85534/\">Erik Drekken</a> has become obsessed with the work of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-37585\" href=\"/professor-zackro/4005-37585/\">Prof. Emery Zackro</a>. Considered a fringe lunatic by the scientific community at large, Zackro’s early work focused on “hyper-evolution,” a case study of a young man born a hundred thousand years before his time.</p><p>He is the next stage in human evolution, and studying him cost Zackro his career. Now Drekken wants to pick up where he left off.</p><p>His pursuit leads him to rural Kansas, following strange stories of the “Blake Farm Ghost.” However, the owner of the Blake farm shows him nothing but hostility, and he leaves empty handed.</p><p>Rain begins to fall as Drekken heads on to the next town. En route, however, his eyes are pulled away from the road by the sight of a UFO, soaring overhead.</p><p>He glances back down and nearly runs over a young man in the road.</p><p>Drekken swerves. His car bursts through the guard rail and flies off the road.</p><p>He stops in mid-air. The young man catches his car telekinetically and guides it safely back to the road.</p><p>“It’s you!” Drekken exclaims. “The one Zackro wrote about!”</p><p>His name is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30559\" href=\"/captain-comet/4005-30559/\">Adam Blake</a>, and he possesses impossible abilities. His earliest memory is of his own birth, and the comet that passed overhead at that same moment. He sensed it there, above him, as its radiation mutated him in his first moments of life.</p><p>Drekken begs Blake to let him study him. If the secrets behind his mutation could be isolated and replicated, it could bring about a Golden Age for all of humanity.</p><p>Blake, however, says it is impossible. He has already given Prof. Zackro all the relevant data, and even if there were anything new to discover, he will not be around long enough for Drekken to study him.</p><p>The UFO returns for Adam Blake. It is time for him to go. There is a list of doomed planets. Their only hope lies in those like him, planetary cuckoos, the ones who don’t belong.</p><p>As he is born aloft by a trio of haloed aliens, he warns Drekken that one of the planets on the list is Earth.</p><p>The end of the world is nigh. Drekken returns to his car, convinced that his work is more important than ever. He will get his hands on Zackro’s data, one way or another. He will find a way to replicate the comet’s radiation. He will push mankind up the evolutionary ladder.</p><p>The human race depends on it.</p><p><i><b>Notes:</b></i></p><ul><li>Clark Kent makes reference to <i>The Experiencer</i>, a 1977 experimental film by Michael Kohler.

She is searching for the \"Green Man\" to bring back the spring. She passes out just as that generations Swamp Thing appears. He carries her to his home where he nurtures her back to health. She tells him that the cold is killing everyone in town, and he consoles her by telling her to be patient, that soon he will bring about a great spring. She responds by telling him she doesn't want the cold to end.</p><p>Suddenly the girl stretches and grows until out from the girls skin appears Arcane. They fight but soon Arcane kills that avatar. He states that that had not been his first avatar murdered. We flash forward to the Louisiana swamps and see Arcane once again disguised in skin. This time hidden in one of Alec Holland's friends. They are toasting to the success of the bio-restorative formula. Here Arcane thinks back to all the avatars of red and green that he has killed over the years. Later that night after the toast Arcane sneaks into Linda and Alec's home so that he can kill him, but find only Linda. He takes her body and goes after Alec who is not home; rather he is working late in the lab.</p><p>As Arcane goes to visit Alec he talks to him (while in disguise) and calms him from his stress. Then as he leaves he opens a pipe to release flammable chemicals and drops a bunsen burner which causes the lab to ignite. Holland runs out of the burning lab and, alight, he falls into the swamp murk. Arcane burst out of his guise and taunts the trees of the swamp. In Brazil the Parliament of Trees hears Arcane's victory, but one former avatar has an idea to save Alec. Five years later we flash forward to a hand bursting out of the swamp.</p>",

And who…is The Phantom Stranger?</i></p><p><i>Major players in The New 52 will be introduced in these pages!</i></p><p>He tries to kill himself. He tries to tie a rope around his neck and hang from it until dead. He can no longer stand the judgement of others. He has judged himself guilty.</p><p>But even in death, he could not escape his guilt. In death, he is summoned to the <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42436\" href=\"/rock-of-eternity/4020-42436/\">Rock of Eternity</a>.</p><p>Brought before the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59101\" href=\"/circle-of-eternity/4060-59101/\">Council of Wizards</a>, he is found guilty of upsetting the cosmic order of the world. Only the greatest of sinners stood before these wizards, and horrific sentences awaited all three there gathered. Their sins affect the course of the world to this day.</p><p>The Council demands these sinners kneel, and the man complies, as does the woman on his right. The man on his left, however, stands in defiance. The guards force compliance upon him, then are ordered away.</p><p>The Council of Wizards deem these three the greatest transgressors mankind has ever known. They name them the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59099\" href=\"/trinity-of-sin/4060-59099/\">Trinity of Sin</a>.</p><p>They name greed as the man’s mortal sin, a notion he does not agree with. In his eyes, his mortal sin was the betrayal of his closest friend. Now he begs the Council to forgive him as his friend would.</p><p>“You are beyond forgiveness,” they judge. “Your greed has forever darkened the world.”</p><p>As a reminder of his greed, a necklace of silver coins is painfully branded into his flesh. His hair goes white with shock. The world goes dark around him...</p><p>He awakes in the “Field of Blood,” the land purchased with the coins of betrayal that were now bound to his skin. He begs to be allowed to die, but a voice from the heavens rebukes him. “SINNER! YOUR ULTIMATE FATE AWAITS.”</p><p>The man is instructed to don a dark blue robe, the robe of his betrayed friend, stolen from him on the day of his death. By the robe he is changed. He becomes a Stranger to all.</p><p>“YOUR PENANCE IS TO WALK THIS LAND UNTIL THE DEBT FOR YOUR SINS IS PAID.</p><p>“AND ON THAT DAY, YOU WILL SERVE THE GREATER GOOD.”</p><p>He wanders the earth for centuries, numb to the world, until the twentieth century. After so much time, the voice finally speaks to him again, instructing him to seek out a certain man and begin to make amends.</p><p>The man is found in a police station in the heart of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\" href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\">Gotham City</a>. His name is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5810\" href=\"/jim-corrigan/4005-5810/\">Jim Corrigan</a>, a cop with anger issues, suspended twice for use of excessive force. Corrigan’s fiancee <a data-ref-id=\"4005-29930\" href=\"/gwen-sterling/4005-29930/\">Gwendolyn Sterling</a> has gone missing, and Corrigan suspects she’s been kidnapped by McLauren, whose brother Corrigan shot.</p><p>Corrigan’s commanding officer, Hopkins knows better than to send him on a case so emotionally charged. Regardless, Corrigan defies orders, leaving his badge in the station and heading out into the night.</p><p>The Phantom Stranger finds Corrigan in the streets, mercilessly beating an informant. The Stranger stops him, offering his help in finding the woman he seeks.</p><p>The Stranger shares a vision with Corrigan of his fiancee, alive and well, and takes him to the location revealed therein. But instead of finding his beloved Gwen, Corrigan finds McLauren’s men waiting in ambush for him. He is gunned down as the Stranger watches in disbelief.</p><p>As Corrigan’s soul leaves its body, it is transformed. He becomes a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-2361\" href=\"/spectre/4005-2361/\">Spectre</a>, a creature of divine wrath, ready to murder the Stranger for his betrayal. The Voice intervenes, however. The Spectre is needed elsewhere, and the Phantom Stranger won’t escape his destiny so easily.</p><p>A silver coin falls from the Stranger’s throat. A debt paid for services rendered.</p><p>Until he is called again he has no choice but to watch and wait, nothing more... than a Stranger.</p>",

He’ll never break the curse! Send him back already!”</i></p><p>Another voice, a more commanding voice, beckons him onward, deeper into the temple. He passes unimaginable marvels. Behind one door, an indoor snowstorm, memories of a childhood snowman. Down a hall, illusive specters of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-59474\" href=\"/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-man/4060-59474/\">Seven Deadly Sins of Man</a>.</p><p>And at the end of the hall, six empty thrones, with an impossibly ancient man seated in the seventh.

They disappoint you. They let you down. I’ve spent my life learning that... You’re searching for something that doesn’t really exist. That’s why you’ve never found it.”</p><p>Time runs short for the Wizard. Black Adam has already been freed from imprisonment. He searches the boy’s mind for the embers of good, seeking even a glimmer of hope.</p><p>And though Billy Batson is not the warrior of pure good he sought, the Wizard does see potential in him. He teaches the boy the word that will summon his magics. The word that when spoken with purpose, with belief, with good intentions, will transform him into his greatest potential.</p><p>“SHAZAM!”</p><p>Billy Batson inherits the Wizard’s chair on the Council of Eternity, and with it, the Power of the Living Lightning. He will be able to travel through the sky as lightning does, to fight with the strength of a demigod.</p><p>And he will have to fight, to stop Black Adam from awakening the Seven Deadly Sins of Man. Black Adam will stop at nothing to become absolute ruler of all magic.</p><p>As the Wizard passes from this world, he declares Billy Batson magic’s champion. Billy Batson is now Shazam!</p><p>***</p><p>Billy Batson returns from the Rock of Eternity, now in possession of the Power of the Living Lightning. And as his first act as magic’s champion, Billy Batson pays a visit to the Bryers’ house. With his magnificent strength, he lifts the Bryers’ car into the air before casually crumpling it hood first into the ground.</p><p>He and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-10935\" href=\"/freddy-freeman/4005-10935/\">Freddy</a> then try to use his now adult appearance to buy beer, but Billy feels a bit conspicuous in cloak and magic armor. He also has a hard time interacting with electrical objects, causing them to explode with living magic.</p><p>As it grows late, the criminal element of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56100\" href=\"/philadelphia/4020-56100/\">Philadelphia</a> makes itself known. Freddy and Billy witness a mugging, and Billy decides to intervene. He swats the criminal aside, but his strength is greater than he realizes, and the man goes flying into the side of a nearby car.</p><p>The woman he saved is incredibly grateful, and she asks if there is any way she can thank him. Freddy suggests that Billy should ask for some cash, and the woman awkwardly hands him a twenty dollar bill.</p><p>As the woman shouts her thanks, the boys walk away to celebrate their newfound source of income.</p><p><i>***</i></p><p><i>“I know what I’m dealing with now. I know what this box is and I know what it can do.</i></p><p><i>“I was a frightened and manipulated girl when I opened it the last time. Not anymore. I’m going to right my perceived wrongs and I’m going to erase the evils I unknowingly unleashed.</i></p><p><i>“My name is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81779\" href=\"/pandora/4005-81779/\">Pandora</a>, and for the first time since I was sentenced by the Council of Eternity I have hope.”</i></p><p>With <a data-ref-id=\"4055-56450\" href=\"/pandoras-box/4055-56450/\">the Box</a> once again in her possession, Pandora feels confident that she can open it once more and undo her great sin. Yet try as she might, the Box refuses to open. Frustrated, she tries firing her gun at it. The bullet merely ricochets off its surface, grazing her cheek.</p><p>Behind her, the world erupts with the Living Lightning. The Wizard appears before her, using the last of his power to bring her this message.</p><p>“The Council was foolish... Wrong. Our judgements were... Poor.</p><p>“The other two of the Trinity of Sin deserved their punishment, but you... You did not, Pandora. You were just a young woman... Who was curious.</p><p>“I am sorry.”</p><p>He tells her that it is far too late to put back the evils once contained within the Box. “You cannot imprison what has already been unleashed,” he says, “yet there is still great power contained...</p><p>“Only the strongest of heart or the darkest can open the box and claim its power...”</p><p>With another flash of living lightning, the Wizard is gone. Though Pandora begs to know the identity of the one who can open the Box, no answer comes.</p><p>***</p><p>In <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55843\" href=\"/hub-city/4020-55843/\">Hub City</a>, the desperate search for the mayor’s daughter comes to an end when an unknown vigilante saves her from kidnapper <a data-ref-id=\"4005-65115\" href=\"/john-dandy/4005-65115/\">John Dandy</a>. The only clue to the hero’s identity is a simple piece of paper, adorned with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3211\" href=\"/vic-sage/4005-3211/\">a question mark</a> and pinned to the perp.</p><p><i>Poverty.

This former assassin just wants to live a normal life...but that’s impossible, since he’s being hunted by his former masters!</i></p><p>The issue starts in a dog kennel, where the eight years old, Calvin, was locked up by his own father. After three endless nights, the boy finally manages to escape. He ran until he was found by a performer at Haly's Circus, who was trained in the art of the escape. He taught Calvin all he knew, and when the performer died, the boy took over his act. One night, the owner of the circus asked Calvin to do his best in an act to a stranger. The ´´stranger`` was a member of the Court of Owls. The organization, then, trained Calvin until he could become a talon. When the time came, the boy killed the current talon of the court (which made Calvin traumatized). He was, then, given his first mission: to eliminate the Washington bloodline, by killing the daughter of Eric Washington. What the court didn't tell him was that the woman had a 2 years old daughter. Calvin can't do it, so he just ''kidnaps'' both of them and starts running from the court.</p><p>5 years ago: While Calvin was working, he sees a man about to ´´jump from a bridge``. When he comes close to the man, Calvin notices that he is already dead. In fact killed by a talon, who wraps Calvin in chains and puts him in a car that is pushed to the sea. He easilly escapes and asks the talon what the court wants with him. The assassin says that they don`t plan on killing him, but bringing him back to the Court of Owls. That said, the issue ends with Calvin driving away.</p>",

A child is born.</b></i></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-30196\" href=\"/woodson-hex/4005-30196/\">Woodson Hex</a> grows impatient, but there is little he can do to hurry the process along. As the women who attend to his wife remind him, his son will be born when he’s good and ready.</p><p>Hex steps outside to smoke his pipe and wait. The boy is stubborn, and the labor could take all night.</p><p>Three riders soon approach. Their leader introduces himself as Ashby. “By order of Colonel William Jennings, Sheriff of Caldwell County, these men and I are after fugitive Mormons who might have taken shelter among sympathetic souls.”</p><p>Politely, Hex asks them to leave. Much less politely, Ashby tells him that they will be entering his house with or without his invitation, under the authority of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55752\" href=\"/missouri/4020-55752/\">Missouri</a> Governor Boggs’ Mormon Extermination Order.</p><p>Hex has heard of Ashby and his men. Not long ago, they killed some boys and old men near Halin’s Mill. Rumor had it they even crushed a nine month old baby under their horses’ hooves.</p><p>They die that night by his hand.</p><p>As the last of them begs for mercy, one of the women comes out to give Hex the news: his son has been born. Hex names the boy <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3614\" href=\"/jonah-hex/4005-3614/\">Jonah</a>, then ends the trespasser’s life.</p><p><i><b>Misery in Missouri</b></i></p><p>Years pass, and Woodson Hex turns to vice. Drinking and gambling have consumed six years of his life, while his family suffers his abuse.</p><p>Tonight, Hex flies into a rage, accusing his wife of sleeping with the traveling salesman that visits while he’s in town. His hands wrap around her throat, and though she claws at his face, she is little match for his drunken fury.</p><p>He is stopped by the sound of a pistol’s hammer, clicking into place. Young Jonah steps in, ready to shoot his father in the head if he doesn’t let his mother go.</p><p>For a moment, it seems that Woodson Hex has learned the error of his ways. Then his anger flares once more, and her turns on his son, dragging him outside and beating him senseless.</p><p>While the young boy may have lacked the will to act, though, his mother is determined. She will shoot him dead if he doesn’t leave. She tells him to sleep it off, to come back when he’s sober.</p><p>He threatens not to come back at all.</p><p><i><b>Abandonment</b></i></p><p>The next day, Virginia Hex comes to a decision. She can’t take her husband’s abuse anymore. She’s decided to leave him. The salesman, Mr. Dazzleby, has agreed to take her in.</p><p>But he won’t take her boy.</p><p>Jonah begs her not to go, but she feels she has no choice. She leaves with Dazzleby, abandoning her son to his father.</p><p>Jonah follows their trail, desperate to catch up with her. Hours later, his father finds him, alone and exhausted.</p><p><i><b>In the clutches of the Apache</b></i></p><p>The <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55716\" href=\"/california/4020-55716/\">California</a> Gold Rush calls Woodson Hex westward in search of his fortune. En route, he encounters a hostile tribe of Apachean natives. In exchange for safe passage through their land, Hex gives them the only thing of value he has left: his son, Jonah.</p><p>Jonah Hex is put to work cleaning the deer caught and killed by the tribe. He becomes the target of abuse by the boys of the tribe, especially one <a data-ref-id=\"4005-80632\" href=\"/noh-tante/4005-80632/\">Noh-Tante</a>.</p><p><i><b>The betrayal</b></i></p><p>Over time, Jonah Hex is accepted by the Apache, adopted as one of their own. As he comes of age, he and the other boys are sent on a raid of the nearby Kiowa people. It is their final test; when the mission is finished, they will return to their people as men.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not to be Hex’s fate. During the raid, he is betrayed by Noh-Tante, left for dead among the bodies of their enemies.</p><p>The next morning, he is rescued by White scavengers...</p><p><i><b>Fort Donelson, Tennessee</b></i></p><p>America has been engulfed in <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56027\" href=\"/american-civil-war/4015-56027/\">civil war</a>. Young Jonah Hex finds himself part of an assault on Fort Donnelson, fighting to take back the fort for the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56446\" href=\"/confederate-army/4060-56446/\">Confederacy</a>.</p><p>They fail.</p><p>Rebel forces are cut down by <a data-ref-id=\"4060-58435\" href=\"/union-army/4060-58435/\">Union</a> gatling guns. Hex fights valiantly, slashing at his enemies with a tomahawk, but even he cannot stand against such an assault. He is captured by Union Captain Fulsome, who decides to make an example of him.</p><p><i><b>The Cumberland River</b></i></p><p>Hex is stripped naked and bound to a raft, with only an American flag draped mockingly over his loins. Then, with his commander’s permission, Captain Fulsome takes the lash to Hex’s face, scarring him horribly.</p><p>Hex vows vengeance on the cruel Union officer. Fulsome only grins as he sets Hex adrift down the Cumberland River.</p><p>Once again, fate intervenes. A kindly family rescues him, and nurses him back to health.</p><p><i><b>The Mark of the Demon</b></i></p><p>Jonah Hex returns to the Apache with vengeance in mind. Though his “father” is pleased to see him, Hex wishes only to kill Noh-Tante. He draws his gun, but the chief insists that this dispute be settled honorably.</p><p>Both men are stripped to the waist and forced to battle using only their tomahawks. The outcome will be determined by the strongest warrior.</p><p>The two fight ferociously, and their battle takes them far from the eyes of the tribe. There, Noh-Tante cheats, striking Hex below the belt and sabotaging his weapon. Noh-Tante lunges, going in for the kill...</p><p>Hex pulls a knife from his boot, and plunges it into his enemy’s throat.</p><p>When the other member’s of the tribe arrive, they find him guilty of breaking the rules of battle. The law commands his death, but the chief owes Hex his life and will now repay that debt.</p><p>Still, he will not escape this day unpunished. Before the eyes of the tribe, Hex is bound to a tree and the chief brands his face with a white-hot tomahawk. “Wherever you go, people will know you are a man of two minds. A man who is both good and evil. You will bear the Mark of the Demon!”</p><p><i><b>Gotham City</b></i></p><p>A drunk Jonah Hex finishes telling his story to his compatriots in present day <a data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\" href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\">Gotham</a>.</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"4005-85246\" href=\"/reginald-frosythe/4005-85246/\">Reginald Frosythe</a> offers Hex, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50547\" href=\"/amadeus-arkham/4005-50547/\">Arkham</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-67302\" href=\"/tallulah-black/4005-67302/\">Black</a> three thousand dollars to locate a thief for his employer, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-22215\" href=\"/dr-jekyllmr-hyde/4005-22215/\">Dr. Jekyll</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere in Gotham, a miraculously healed Rogan McKee approaches his uncle with a true cure-all formula, one that is sure to make them a fortune.</p><p>And at the docks, the <a data-ref-id=\"4005-81680\" href=\"/barbary-ghost/4005-81680/\">Barbary Ghost</a> as come to Gotham in search of her mother...</p><p><i><b>Notes:</b></i></p><ul><li>Governor Lilburn Boggs signed Missouri Executive Order 44 (the “Mormon Extermination Order”) on October 27, 1838. Jonah Hex is established in this issue as having been born on November 1; the timing of Boggs’ order helps establish the year of his birth, likely that same year.</li><li>The California Gold Rush began on January 24, 1848, but it is unlikely that Woodson Hex, living in Missouri, heard about it until 1849. When exactly he chose to go west is not established in this issue.</li><li>The Southern Army lost Fort Donelson to the North in one of the first major Union victories of the American Civil War. Confederate forces attempted to retake the fort on August 25, 1863. It is likely that this is the battle we see depicted in this issue.</li><li>The scenes of “present day” Gotham are set between issues 12 and 13 of <i><a data-ref-id=\"4050-43019\" href=\"/all-star-western/4050-43019/\">All-Star Western</a></i>.</li></ul>",

Los Angeles- some call it the city of angels, others call it a cesspool of debauchery and self indulgence- but whatever you choose to call it, one thing is clear; L.A. is where all the action is. When an entertainment newspaper stops covering celebrity tabloids and starts to focus on the superhero community, all hell breaks loose. From closeted capes, to drugged out Do-Gooders, no one is safe from the poison pen of Sara Michaels and her award winning snake of a photographer, Glenn Barry. From the people who brought you The Legend of Isis, Tenth Muse, and Wrath of the Titans, comes a new type of comic book that explores what goes on under the spandex, and we aren't talking Botox! This special edition has never before seen images and character designs from the series. </em></p>",

Ville par ville, ils avancent et dévorent les vivants. La pandémie qui a emporté les pays pauvres se répand maintenant sur le reste du monde. Cependant, les nations développées ne prennent pas la réelle mesure du danger. LaPointe, acteur canadien de série B, pour qui le futile a meilleur goût que l'essentiel, poursuit son existence comme si de rien n'était. Invité d'honneur à un festival de cinéma d'horreur, il se retrouve piégé en Russie. Seul en territoire zombie, il comprend qu'il n'a rien d'un héros quand la réalité rejoint la fiction. Avoir tué des centaines de mort-vivants dans des films ne le rend pas meilleur qu'un autre. Aujourd'hui, plus de scénario, de doublures ou de trucages. Pourtant il doit jouer le rôle de sa vie : Celui de sa survie.</em></p>",
