            "description": "<p>Not much happens this issue. Adam Strange and Starfire fight a bounty hunter, Question dies (we're told), Renee Montoya looks like she's taken his place, Ralph Dibny gets closer to his goal, and there's a guest appearance at the end.</p><p>Week 41, Day 1.</p><p>Molek the Hunter attacks Adam Strange and Starfire. Strange attacks the bounty hunter, but Starfire is injured. The two manage to take the hunter down, and tell him that Lady Styx is dead. The hunter tells his ship to self-destruct before he dies, and Adam Strange, carrying a wounded Starfire, manages to get away just in time.</p><p>Week 41, Day 2.</p><p>Nanda Parbat.</p><p>Renee has made it to Nanda Parbat, but Question has died. Renee is told that Richard Dragon is waiting for her in an ice cave, and Renee goes to meet him. The two fight, and Renee reveals that she is going to carry on for Question. Richard tells her that she has to stop running away from herself if she truly wants to honour her friend, and tells her to face with who she is and who she can become. Renee can't face teh question and runs away.</p><p>Week 41, Day 3.</p><p>Haven Correctional Facility.</p><p>Ralph Dibny is in Haven trying to figure out how T.O. Morrow disappeared. Dibny reveals that someone must have planted teleportation microcircuitry into the security cameras that beamed the mad scientist out. Dibny then goes to visit another inmate, Milo, who has hidden a magical object in the wheel of his wheelchair. Dibny steals the Silver Wheel of Nyorlath and teleports away with the helmet of Dr. Fate. The helmet says, \"the final hour is at last upon us.\"</p><p>Week 41, Day 5.</p><p>Renee finds another woman sitting on a bench in Nanda Parbat contemplating life. The raven haired lady tells Renee that she is waiting for a friend, Renee tells the woman about Question, and about her feelings and doubts. The woman tells Renee that she can only find the answers to her questions from within, and asks her to explore the frustrating question of her identity. In the last frame, we see that the woman, who has put her arm on Renee's shoulder, has a silver bracelet peeking out from her sleeve that is identical to that of Wonder Woman. Take a second look at the lady and she is indeed Diana.</p><p>Renee takes the advice of Wonder Woman and returns to the ice cave.</p><p>Week 41, Day 7.</p><p>The spaceship of Adam Strange and Starfire is plummeting into a sun, and Strange is frustrated and hopeless. Starfire tries to use a pep talk on him, though she is slowly losing consciousness as her life force flows from her wounds. Strange goes to try to figure out how to stop the ship as Starfire drifts asleep.</p><p>Suddenly something huge appears between the ship and the sun. The ship crashlands onto the planet and into a beautiful lake, above which a Green Lantern is flying. It turns out that Mogo, the Green Lantern planet, has saved the duo.</p><p>Plus: The Origin of Starfire with Joe Benitez.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The story picks up right where the last issue left off. Atom Eve just passed out and her force field fell, giving the Sequids and opening to attack the Guardians. Unfortunately, Robot isn't done building his device so the team tries their hardest to protect him while he finishes. While the others defend Robot, The Immortal flies to directly attack the Sequid host but gets batted away. Shapesmith forms a ball around Robot to protect him as he works and the others take on the Sequid army. When Robot finally finishes building he gives the device to Shapesmith so he can pass it on to someone who can get close enough to the Sequid host for it to work. Thinking he can do it himself, The Immortal grabs the machine and heads towards the host but is smacked down by Invincible. Invincible forcefully informs The Immortal that he, Invincible, is stronger and faster and that the task is too important to let The Immortal's ego get in the way. Invincible is as good as he says he is and successfully activates the device in the hosts face. The Sequid parasites are all knocked out and Invincible is able to save the astronaut they had been using for a host. With the aliens momentarily stunned and the astronaut in hand, the Guardians of the Globe make a break for it.</p><p>In a nuclear base on Earth, a one-armed and battle-weary Rex-Splode kneels before the leader of the Lizard League. The villains pulls the trigger of the gun at Rex's head but somehow it doesn't kill him. Rex acts while he's still able and puts the bad guy down in a couple punches. Before he can celebrate though, he falls to the ground.</p><p>In the blackness of space far above all this, the Guardians of the Globe make it to the command center of the ship where the Martians are waiting. They thank and congratulate the team but demand that they leave the astronaut behind to be executed. The Guardians refuse and are forced to flee in a stolen Martian ship. Unfortunately for the Guardians, they are unable to use the weapons on the ship, which becomes a problem when other Martian ships get launched from the mother ship and start to attack. Since they can't attack, Invincible leaves the ship and takes on the others on his own. When he returns to his ship he gets nothing but praise from his teammates. Then he and Atom Eve talk about a kiss they recently shared. </p><p>Back on Earth, Mark visits Amber and finds her with another guy. She hasn't cheated on him while he's been gone but she likes the guy he sees her with. Mark learns this from peeking into the window and makes a decision. He flies around the building and walks up to Amber's room just as the guy leaves. He talks to Amber and after a long, one-sided conversation, Mark and Amber break up. The decision is mutual, Amber was going to say the same things Mark had if he hadn't said them first. She will pursue the guy she met in his absence and Mark will go after Atom Eve.</p><p>Mark goes to see Rex-Splode, the last surviving member of the team that went to stop the Lizard League. Rex complains about Invincible getting a parade while his mission had to be hidden, but afterwards he said he wasn't seriously mad.</p><p>At his home that night, Rus Livingston, the rescued astronaut, coughs up some Sequids and they crawl over his face and body. As soon as they fully control his body they say (to no one in particular) that it's only a matter of time before they take over the Earth.</p>",

Meanwhile, Lori and Carol have become closer friends again. While in discussion, Carol asks Lori if she would take care of her daughter if anything were to happen to her. Shocked, Lori said yes, but not to think like that. Glenn and his wife, Maggie, discuss having children, which Glenn is not in favor of. Maggie thinks differently, and they wonder what they should do. Meanwhile, Alice the nurse tells Andrea, who is going with a group of other survivors for target practice against the zombies, to bring a zombie back into the penitentiary so she could study it. When Rick catches wind of this information, he grabs a gun and tries to kill the zombie, but Alice stops him, trying to convince him that studying the zombie is very important. Rick unwillingly concedes. Tyreese and Andrea play a basketball game outside when Carol suddenly walks towards the captured zombie and expresses to the zombie that it's the only thing that seems to care about her. Carol comes close to the zombie for a hug and the zombie bites hard against her chest.</p>",
