            "description": "<p><em>Join the all-new adventure of May Parker, daughter of the 'infamous' Spider-Man, on her journey to finding herself as well as control over her powers -- powers that “Dad” has passed down to her!</em></p><p><strong>May \"Mayday\" Parker</strong> is still trying to reason with her new found powers and whether or not she should continue to use them in a superhero capacity. She begins to \"research\" <strong>Spider-Man</strong> and ends up talking to her father's assistant, <strong>Phil Urich</strong>. Phil informs her the legacy of Spider-Man as some speculate, about how a freak accident lead to his creation and how he was first in entertainment until a burglar he let go killed someone close to him. Before long, Peter shows up and, as he, May, and <strong>Captain Ruiz</strong> are leaving the precinct, Peter and May feel their spider-sense tingling. A suspicious man begins to follow Peter and Captain Ruiz, but May ambushes the man into an alley. Scurrying up a wall, she avoids letting the man see her as she tails him as he goes into a clothing store. She decides to leave the man be since he didn't commit any crime that she saw. Back at school, her friend <strong>Davida Kirby</strong> tries to get her to loosen up by going to the mall after basketball practice, but May is down because she starts to feel using her powers on the court is too much of an advantage to exploit.</p><p>At home over dinner, <strong>Peter</strong> talks about how he is working on a case with mobsters dealing with the fashion industry. May begins to think there may be a connection with the man since he went into a clothing store. Donning a make-shift black costume and using some web shooters she kept hidden, she takes to the city. Infiltrating the clothing store, she finds her man, <strong>Shaky</strong>, being grilled by his employer, the masked <strong>Mr. Nobody</strong>. She takes them on until Captain Ruiz and the police show up. May makes it out the window and Mr. Nobody is able to teleport out as well. Mr. Nobody then shows up in the prison cell of none other than the <strong>Kingpin</strong> to tell him about what happened. Back at the Parkers', May waits in her room, pretending to be asleep, for Peter to come and talk to her. He doesn't and over the next few days, she begins work on her very own costume as the issue comes to an end.</p>",

As this day is Halloween, Everett and Angelo plan to go to a showing of the film \"Nosferatu\"; Jubilee declines their invitation.</p><p>Later, on a train nearing Massachusetts after a visit with her mother, Paige nods off and has a dream about Jono; his face is restored, but he also has fangs.</p><p>That night, as Sean Cassidy (Banshee), Jono, Everett and Angelo watch the movie, four trick-or-treating kids discover the bloody body of the ticket-seller in the box office. The shadow of Dracula looms in the street.</p><p>Jono has gone to the restroom, where he is attacked by the walking corpse of the ticket-seller. Jono's energy field erupts in defense, and the attacker drops a black scarf with a distinctive 'D' monogram.</p><p>Meanwhile, the trick-or-treaters have made their way to the school, where Jubilee invites them in, unwittingly extending that invitation to Dracula inches mist form. He coalesces and confronts Jubilee, who feebly tries to defend herself, but the vampire lord opts to look elsewhere for the mutant blood he craves this night. He finds the recently-arrived Paige and soon has her under his control.</p><p>As Sean drives his students back home, Jono evades questions about his encounter at the theater, then psychically senses Paige's distress. He urges Sean to drive faster. Jubilee is relieved by their return, but Jono finds a bloody 'D' smeared on the wall, with the letter in the same style as the monogram on the scarf he's now wearing.</p><p>The mutants follow Dracula's trail to the church where he is toying with the captive Paige. The Gen-Xers burst in, but first have to deal with Dracula's thralls. Jono splits off, and Jubilee follows, as he finds the vampire lord and Paige. Jubilee attacks but is easily tossed aside by Dracula. She turns to aid Paige, while Dracula tempts Jonothan with promises of a restored body if he surrenders himself to the vampire's bite. Jono wavers, and Paige take the opportunity to shed her skin, becoming wood-like, and she stakes Dracula. However, she misses his heart.</p><p>Jono recovers and pulls down a drape, allowing the rays of the rising sun. Dracula flees and the church collapses. Soon, the Gen-Xers, along with the freed thralls, exit the rubble relatively unharmed. The mutants express their doubts that the night they just experienced actually happened.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>The cover is a homage to the cover of <em><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-x-men-136-child-of-light-and-darkness/4000-20613/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-20613\">The X-Men #136</a></em>.</li></ul>",

The dead end alley where he died has become a shrine where victimized denizens of the neighborhood leave their offerings. Among these lost souls is Lucy Mellace, a woman abused by husband.</p><p>However, the door of a nearby drug lab bursts open to reveal a very much alive Punisher, albeit with glowing red eyes, a mystic symbol emblazoned upon his forehead, and sporting a pair of spectral weapons. A gunfight erupts, with the Punisher mowing down the criminals. The conflict sets off a fire, while one of the men escapes to the roof. The Punisher follows him and reaching the man, throws him off the building. The fire then causes the roof to collapse, dropping Castle into the blaze, but he soon walks out of the burning structure, unscathed.</p><p>Not far away, in a desanctified church, two grigori, or guardian angels, pray, but are soon accosted by a group of creatures called stalkers, led by a demon named Olivier. One is killed by the attackers and the other is wounded, but manages to get away. Olivier absorbs the devine essence of the dead grigori as he recalls his own fall From Grace, and his subsequent expulsion from hell, which had left him to inhabit the body of a baby who would have been stillborn.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lucy has returned to her apartment where her angry husband raises his hand against her, but the lights go out, and the Punisher pummels him to unconsciousness. She recognizes him as Frank Castiglione, her brother's best friend when they were growing up. Despite this, Frank leaves, returning to the alley where his shrine sits. As he contemplates his inexplicable return, he sees his dead wife and children, seemingly whole, enter the alley. They lead him to a nearby rooftop, where he finds Tariel, the wounded angel, who created the vision of his family to lure him up to where he lies bleeding. The dying angel begs Frank to stop Olivier, by first finding a fellow grigori named Gadriel, at a low dive called Milton's. With that, the angel births into Flame.</p><p>Two hours later, Castle finds the bar, briefly crossing paths outside with Daimon Hellstrom (Hellstorm). Within, he finds Gadriel at the bar, informing him of the deaths of his fellow angels. When is Gadriel is less than forthcoming with information about Olivier, the Punisher turns violent, upon which Gadriel confesses to him that he is the guardian angel who had failed to protect Castle's family. The Punisher reacts by drawing a spectral gun upon Gadrial, telling him to pray.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Logan (Wolverine) takes a holiday in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, during Carnaval, the festival honoring the spirits of the dead. His first stop is to the Central Police Precinct to visit Detective Antonio Vargas, an old friend who, years before, had owned the 'Devil's Grill', a watering hole where he had employed Logan as a bouncer. Vargas is overjoyed to see Logan, but he also expresses his frustration at so far being unable to solve a series of murder he refers to as \"vampire killings\".</p><p>Another detective interrupts the two men with news of the discovery of several new victims. Logan accepts Vargas's invitation join him at the crime scene, a grotto on the shore. As they view the bodies floating in the inlet, a shark, attracted by the blood, leaps from the water at the pair. Logan slashes at it with his claws, killing the predator.</p><p>In a run-down chapel outside the city, an aged man called Saint Cyrus Leviticus converses with a voice only he can hear. His companion, a woman named Ezra Asher, expresses derision at what she views as his schizophrenia. He angrily responds that just as she thirsts for blood, so he hungers for the spiritual energy he expects from the Carnaval celebrants.</p><p>That evening, Logan attends the festivities, partying hard into the wee hours. Needing a brief respite, he ducks into an alleyway, where he is confronted by a gang of 'bate-bola boys' who intend to beat and mug him. Eager to brawl, Logan joyfully lays into them.</p><p>The next morning finds him sitting in a café, recuperating from the night's activities. Vargas arrives and Logan offers his services in the contiiuing investigation. As they walk through the streets, Vargas talks about his wife, who had disappeared years earlier, and whom he presumes is dead.</p><p>Not far away, the bate-bola boys lie in their flat, trying to recover from the beating delivered by their would-be victim hours earlier. Suddenly, Ezra appears, hanging upside-down outside their window. Intending to have sport with her, they move toward the window. But as they come closer, she flashes her fangs and leaps in, biting one of the gangbangers. She makes short work of them and then feasts on their blood.</p><p>Later, having come up empty on the case, Logan and Vargas retire to a bar for drinks. Later still, the inebriated pair stumble to Vargas's apartment, where they find two strangers within. One of the bate-bola boys, now a walking corpse, knocks out Logan from behind with a baseball bat. The male intruder, Cyrus, tells Vargas his investigations have brought the detective to his attention, sealing his fate. As Cyrus leaves with the punk, the woman, Ezra, kisses Vargas, and then tells him to look into her face. When he does, he recognizes her as his missing wife. She then clamps her fangs onto his throat.</p><p>When morning arrives, Logan comes to, only to find the blood-drenched corpse of his friend. He also recognizes the lingering scent of Vargas's long-lost wife.</p><p>The next day, following the funeral, Logan takes it upon himself to track down the killers. After hours of searching, he and the dead bate-bola boys find each other. They clash, and this time, Logan fights for his life. But the gang spreads toxic fumes which overwhelm the X-Man, rendering him unconscious.</p><p>When he comes to, he finds he's bound to a pew in the run-down chapel Cyrus uses as his base. He also sees several of Ezra's bite marks on his flesh. Cyrus approaches Logan and begins to speak of immortality and the higher destiny that awaits those live forever. He then lifts his cloak to reveal that his body has symbiotically bonded with a hideous alien creature, his 'other', with whom he has been conversing. Cyrus tells Logan he plans to send his zombies on a killing spree on the final night of Carnaval, so he can feed on the psychic distress of the murder victims, bringing about some form of ascension. He then exits with his minions, leaving Logan alone with Ezra.</p><p>She begins to feed on Logan again, but he breaks free from his chains, and they savagely attack each other. When Logan gains the advantage, Ezra leaps out through a window. Logan does not follow, instead opting to trail Cyrus and the zombies. He reaches the city and faces dozens of the creatures.</p><p>Logan defeats the undead mob, and then finds Cyrus on a rooftop overlooking the festival. Logan attacks him, but Cyrus fights back, holding his own and managing to overpower the feral mutant. With his plan gone awry, Cyrus intends to have his symbiote feed on Logan, but once the alien is exposed, Logan slashes it and kills it. He then impales Cyrus upon his claws, while the crowd below cheers, thinking the struggle is merely a performance.</p><p>The next day, Logan makes one last visit to Vargas's grave, and then leaves on a motorcycle, while Ezra watches from the branches of a nearby tree.</p><p> </p><p>[<em>Note: Inker Eduardo Alpuente is mis-credited on the inside cover credits as writer.</em>]</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Seer, a minion of Doctor Doom, has a prophecy of an all-powerful being known as Onslaught -- no surprise that megalomaniacal Doom seeks to harness its power!</em></p><p>Within Castle Doom in Latveria, Dr. Doom has ordered his seer to bring forth glimpses of the future to aid him in his plans of world conquest. The seer manifests a vision of the battle against Onslaught which is to take place many years later. Doom demands more, but the exhausted mystic collapses, much to the tyrant's frustration.</p><p>Something about Onslaught's appearance seems familiar to Doom, so he pulls up on his video monitors film footage of recent incidents. He finds what he seeks: the initial conflict between Magneto and the X-Men that first brought the existence of super-powered mutants to the public's attention.</p><p>The next morning, determined to learn if the link between Magneto and Onslaught goes beyond their similar appearances, Doom intends to use his time platform to travel to critical points of Magneto's life to observe, while remaining shielded and cloaked aboard his machine. Bringing the seer along, he first ventures to the recent past and Magneto's attempted takeover of Cape Citadel. Doom is impressed by the abilities of both the master of magnetism and the mutant youngsters assembled to oppose him. As Magneto makes his escape, Doom orders the seer to establish a psionic link with him in order to locate Magneto in the timestream.</p><p>They then travel farther into the future, when the X-Men defeat Magneto in the Savage Land, and then farther still to another battle within an underground base in Antarctica. This time, the master of magnetism faces the second generation of X-Men, the conflict having damaged the systems that are in place to protect the base from the surrounding volcanic activity. While the conflict rages, the time travelers' presence catches the attention of Phoenix, thanks to her telepathic mastery. Using her astral form, she confronts Doom, and demands to know why he is there and whether his platform may provide a means of escape. When Doom refuses to divulge any information, she psionically damages the time platform controls within his gauntlet.</p><p>The damage throws the machine off course, and Doom and the seer now find themselves in the devastated New York City of an alternate future when the Sentinels have taken over. They are approached by a Sentinel which orders them to surrender, but Doom easily disables it. He lands the platform, hiding it in a safe spot and leaves it with the seer while he departs to look for supplies to make repairs. Electronically cloaked, he follows the older Wolverine, Colossus and Storm as they are about to make their ill-fated assault on the Sentinel command center. Doom gathers his supplies as the robots destroy the X-Men one by one, then he leaves the facility.</p><p>As Doom makes repairs, the seer tells him he detects no trace of Magneto, surmising he has probably died. His work completed, Doom sets a course for the past, but the seer experiences a psychic backlash when they travel past the moment when Onslaught would be at the peak of his powers. The seer tells Doom that during that one instant, he felt the presence of another mind within the entity, that of Charles Xavier. At that, Doom decides to travel to and observe pivotal points in Xavier's life. They witness his reaction to the death of Thunderbird, his attempt to shut down the Dark Phoenix, and his near possession by a Brood Queen.</p><p>Their final view of Xavier is when the professor would be critically wounded by the Strucker siblings during Magneto's trial. They watch as Magneto agrees to Xavier's wishes for him to lead the X-Men and mentor Xavier's students in his absence. Doom looks upon the scene with disdain, believing Magneto would not fulfill his vow, and is merely comforting a dying man, or more likely, conniving to destroy the X-Men from within.</p><p>Doom then opts to confront Magneto some time after the defeat of Onslaught. He orders his seer to pull the truth from his quarry's mind as they battle. Magneto warns Doom that to seek Onslaught's power is folly, but once the seer, in his astral form, succeeds in extracting the information, the tyrant departs. The information leads them to Avalon where and when Xavier's psychic assault on Magneto leaves the latter in a coma, but also births Onslaught. With the aid of the seer, Doom observes the struggle on the psychic plane, finding the dark seed that would become Onslaught.</p><p>Using an absorption device, Dr. Doom tries to capture the entity, but it discovers him and turns to attack. Upon contact with the time platform's shield, a massive energy surge erupts, sending the time machine back to its point of origin. Although he's failed in his goal, Doom contents himself with his acquisition of valuable knowledge. Unwilling to share this knowledge with anyone, his disintegrates the seer.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Dr. Doom appears here between his appearances in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #5 and FANTASTIC FOUR #23. The X-Men, Professor X and Magneto appear here in scenes parallel to those in (UNCANNY) X-MEN Volume 1, #s 1, 63, 94, 113, 136, 142, 161 and 200.</p>",

            "description": "<p>      Dracula has returned from America to his native Transylvania.  After killing a young barmaid to feed on her blood, he resumes his journey to the ancestral castle that is his home.  As he approaches, he thinks back on his human life when he ruled these lands.  He thinks about his first wife, whom he exiled with their daughter Lilith and how Lilith would become his eternal adversary; about his death in battle and resurrection as a vampire; and about the murder of his beloved second wife, Maria.  Upon entering his castle, he discovers it has been ransacked, and many of his possessions stolen.  Most significantly, his prized portrait of Maria has been taken.</p><p>     In England, Dr. Charles Seward (the great-grandson of Dr. John Seward, one of the group who hunted Dracula as described in Bram Stoker's novel), returns from visiting his estranged wife and their two daughters to the laboratory where he is working on what he considers a highly important cure to an undisclosed disease.  He makes a breakthrough and goes to inform his employer.</p><p>     Dracula invades the home of the town's mayor whom he has charged with watching any who may approach his castle.  After the mayor tells him he saw no one, Dracula kills the mayor's wife, then leaves to meet with his gathered minions to assign them the duty of gathering information about the transgression.  One of his minions, Maltz, is mysteriously abducted.</p><p>     Seward informs his unseen employer that he is ready to begin tests, but the shadowed figure demands that the serum be put to use immediately.  Against Seward's objections and better judgement, he injects the serum into his employer's captive, the vampire Maltz.  </p><p>     Later, Seward acts as a stranded motorist on a country road.  A woman stops her car to assist, but she is attacked and bitten by Maltz.  However, the serum prevents Maltz from being able stomach her blood.  She escapes and runs to her nearby home.  When her husband lets her in, she is succumbing to some kind of flesh-eating virus, which he immediately contracts.</p><p> </p>",

            "description": "<p>Somewhere in the woods of northern California, a group called the Cult of Hades has gathered.  Their leader, referred to as the Link, singles out one member, Victoria, as a traitor.</p><p>Later, the members of X-Force are taking in the sights of Yosemite National Park.  As they drive, they are caught in a landslide. Using their powers, they make it through unscathed.  Dani Moonstar looks for the source of the slide, and she and the others observe an immense hand rising from the landscape.</p><p>They also notice some commotion taking place near the hand, and they proceed toward it.  There, the team finds Hercules engaged in a fight with the Cult of Hades.  X-Force aid Hercules, driving the cultists off.  Hercules introduces Victoria, whom he just rescued, and who had contacted him regarding the Cult's activities.</p><p>The demigod explains that the hand belongs to an ancient Titan which the Cult was attempting to revive.  When Hercules was with the Champions, their first adventure pitted them against Hades (then called Pluto) and his Titans.  Then, they had been able to rout the Titans thanks to an incantation provided by Zeus.</p><p>Later, James Proudstar makes calls to summon Hercules' former teammates (Black Widow, Archangel, Iceman and Johnny Blaze), while Tabitha Smith (Meltdown) expresses her distrust of Victoria.  Sam Guthrie (Cannonball) fires back at Tab that he finds her less trustworthy than Victoria.  Speechless, she wanders off to brood, soon to be joined by Bobby DaCosta (Sunspot).</p><p>The next morning, amidst a throng of soldiers, reporters and gawking civilians, the former Champions arrive at the site of the titanic hand.  With a sense of urgency, Black Widow orders her erstwhile teammates to takes up the positions described in the ritual scrolls provided by Victoria.  Too late, the heroes realize the ritual is meant, not to banish the Titan, but to complete its revival.  In addition, the reawakened Titan is meant to destroy whomever raises him.  </p><p>As it rises, earthquakes rumble, and Sam is knocked out.  With some trepidation, Victoria saves herself, leaving Sam under some rubble.  She is met by the Link, who, now that the ritual is going as he'd planned, reveals himself to be Hades.  The two teams combine forces to take on the god, while Sunspot and Meltdown clear the rockfall to rescue Sam.  However, when they find him, he's not breathing.</p><p>X-Force and the Champions continue to fight Hades, now using a new tactic: they berate him as a minion acting under someone else's command.  Enraged, Hades adamantly declares he is solely responsible for the Titan's rise.  Upon hearing this, the Titan's attention is directed to the god as the one he is meant to destroy.  In defeat, Hades escapes from the earthly plane, while Victoria screams at him not to abandon her.  </p><p>The two teams then turn to deal with the Titan.  At Siryn's suggestion, the Champions again recite the incantation to open the dimensional gate, at which point, Dani Moonstar reaches into the Titan's mind, forcing it to visualize that which it most fears, driving it back whence it came.</p><p>As the heroes regroup and recover, Sam, having been resuscitated by Tabitha, sees Victoria being taken by the authorities, and chides her for betraying him.  In response, Vic tells Sam she truly did care about him, but not as much as Bobby and Tabitha do.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>Before 1977, relatively few people were aware of animation cels as an art form,\" Beck and Friedwald inaugurally opine. Discussion of collectible cel art soon slips away, though, as the object becomes not to evaluate Warner animation, but to praise it on big, lavishly illustrated pages that are bound for heavy duty. Exhaustiveness is not a concern: Beck and Friedwald spotlight a lesser character like Michigan J. Frog, but not many others, mostly, it seems, because M. J. is the spokes-'toon for Warner's TV network. Still, there is plenty of tribute to major creative stalwarts like voice man Mel Blanc and directors Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, Bob McKimson, Tex Avery, and Chuck Jones. The upbeat exposition even cites a few controversies, such as the trimming of Heckling Hare that contributed to Avery's leaving Warner (what the original ending was or why it was changed are never specified, though). Mickey Mouse may be a more successful corporate shill, but Bugs Bunny is the quintessential funny animal. Celebrate him and his posse with this grand tribute.</em></p>",
