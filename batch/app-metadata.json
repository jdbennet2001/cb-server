This causes Logan to have a flashback of him in a bathtub with Atsuko. He talk's of bringing her back the the States with him when he leaves Japan the following night. She says that she was born in Hiroshima, and will be proud to die in Hiroshima. He then pictures her bleeding, Warren with a sword, and the Nuke dropping. Back in the present, Logan is bleeding heavily from his stomach, while Warren is holding the heart he has just ripped from Wolverine's chest. Warren proceeds to swallow the heart and take Logan's coat. As Warren turns to leave, thinking Wolverine is dead, a gravely 'rrrr' comes from behind him. Warren attacks Wolverine, but to no avail as he is decapitated by the ol' Canucklehead. Things go white, and Logan is with Atsuko under a shade tree. She says that she can take away all his pain, but he will have to forfeit all memories of her. In doing so, this will sacrifice him of the pain of losing her. Out of the dream state, Logan regains consciousness as melting snow hits his face. He rises to find a beautiful sunset...alone in the woods.</p>",

They visit for a little bit about they previous night until Logan's blood splatters across Atsuko's face. She turns to the door and finds Lt. Warren standing over her with a rifle.</p><p>Atsuko springs into action, grabbing a sword and slashing Warren. She dives at him to strike a killing blow, only to have Lt. Warren ram the bayonet on his rifle through her chest, killing her. Wolverine arises....</p><p>Logan slices and dices on Warren, but he simply won't die. As it turns out, Warren also has some sort of power that immunes him from getting hurt.</p><p>The two men fight for a few more pages until they see a plane flying overhead. It drops some sort of cargo, but it was to small and too fast for Logan to see what it is. </p><p>It was the Nuclear warhead used to demolish Hiroshima in WWII. An explosion occurs, and the effects are shown on cars, bikes, and various ruble. The last page shows Logan walk on a pile of debris, half a skeleton, and on fire.</p>",

The Chernobyl accident was caused by their failed attempt to control a nuclear explosion.</p><p>Havok and Wolverine share a companionable vacation in Mexico, indulging themselves in a bet to see who can go the longest without using their offensive mutant powers. An unknown party is surveilling the pair.</p><p>Their fun only seems to get more interesting as they are chased down by resentful thugs (who didn't like losing a fight to Logan in a bar) and end up stealing a hot car with an even hotter girl inside it.</p><p>They are pursued by a different group with hi-tech weaponry. Alex fires a plasma bolt to destroy the attackers. The woman takes a modified gun out of her purse and shoots Alex and Logan.</p><p>Logan wakes up in a hospital where he is told that he and Alex contracted the bubonic plague and that Alex has died.</p><p>Logan goes to Alex’s grave. With his heightened sense of smell, he realizes that the scent is wrong. He unearths the coffin to find that it has been stuffed with rocks. Logan vows to find out who has kidnapped Alex.</p>",

Zealot and Artemis' battle is interrupted by the Coda and the current majestrix, Andromache. Artemis reveals that the reason to lure out Zealot was two-fold: either she would meet death under Zealot's blade or she would rally Zealot to overtake the Coda and overthrow Andromache as majestrix. The Coda have come to take the heretic, Artemis, and kill her. Zealot and Artemis take on their Coda sisters while the WildC.A.T.s get free and are able to save Voodoo from Hightower. In the midst of battle, Artemis sacrifices her life for Zealot and the Coda departs, though not on friendly terms.</p>",

The only thing standing in the way of Earth and Armageddon is the WildC.A.T.s.</em></p><p>Youngblood and some members of WildC.A.T.s join together to stop Helspont from bringing his fellow aliens, the Daemonites, to Earth so they could conquer it. Helspont proves to be a formidable foe and is able to rebuff their attack. The rest of the WildC.A.T.s team regroups and give chase to Helspont, leading to a massive battle. Helspont reveals he has a power orb that could power up the transport of his fellow Daemonites when the Gnome and his Triad arrives to steal the orb, blasting Helspont out of the fray. Knowing the orb is too powerful to be allowed in anyone else's hand, Emp blasts the Gnome's arm off and the orb falls down. The Gnome chases after him and the whole facility they are in explodes. Youngblood is able to escape and ponder the fate of the WildC.A.T.s.</p><p>The issue ends with a short preview of Larry Stroman's \"<em>The Tribe</em>\" (Image, 1993).</p>",

They then immediately teleported away, back to Emp's headquarters at the Halo company. Once there, they inform Voodoo about what's going on, how two alien forces, the Daemonites and the Kherubium, have been at war and have spread it, in secret, to the planet Earth. The Deamonites have the ability to possess other beings while the Kherubium have bred with Earthlings, granting people with superhuman powers. Before too long, John Lynch sends the Black Razors to infiltrate the WildC.A.T.s. and Lynch asks for their assistance. They soon learn, thanks to Voodoo, that the Vice President of the United States is actually a Daemonite and have to stop him. Unfortunately, the Vice President is being protected by members of Youngblood, a superhero force team. In the shadows, Gnome is pleased that he has planned all this to his benefit.</p><p>Story 2: Wetworks</p><p>This story introduces the Wetworks.</p>",

He explains that he faked his death in order to get Wesley to become what he was, The Killer. He also explains his past, how he met Wesley's mother and why he had to leave. When Wesley's heard everything, his father asks him to kill him. He knows he's getting old and he's going to die some day and he doesn't want it to be some dumb kid. If it's going to be anyone, it has to be his son. Wesley tries to talk his father out of it but eventually agrees, pulling the trigger as a tear rolls down his cheek. He gets over it quickly though and welcomes his role as a true supervillain.</p>",

He goes through intense training under the guidance of prominent members of the team. Among other things he had target practice with human bodies to get used to splintering bone and flying bits of flesh, he spent fourteen days killing animals by hand to desensitize him and he got his face beaten in for 5 weeks in order to get over the fear of getting punched. After that he went on a killing spree, first killing random people, then killing anyone who had ever bothered him in the past, old teachers, old bullies, old girlfriends, etc. Then he started raping celebrities and killing them for fun. All this was possible since The Fraternity basically runs the world and can get away with whatever they want. His last bit of revenge was killing the \"semi-literate cholo fucks\" who used to harass him and chopping his best friend to pieces for sleeping with his girlfriend. With his training complete, Wesley Gibson became The Killer and was made a full member of The Fraternity. </p><p>At his induction ceremony he met Mr. Rictus, the man most of the other villains thought was behind Wesley's father's death. After he left, The Professor told The Killer about how they had taken over the world and rewrote reality to make everyone forget that there had ever been heroes. The issue closes with The Professor and The Killer looking at the only surviving evidence that there had ever been real heroes; a tattered red cape.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The first issue of Wanted starts with Wesley Gibson describing his life. The first few pages have his girlfriend cheating on him with his best friend, his boss making work hell, him getting chased home by \"semi-literate cholo fucks\" and going home to look online for diseases he might have. His life is crap and he knows it.</p><p>Wesley states that his father walked out on him and his mother when he was 18 weeks old and then the man is shown. Wesley's father is a middle aged man with a big gut and a lot of money. He's about to start filming two younger men having sex (while explaining that he's not gay) when the building they are in is filled with bullets. Mr. Gibson jumps out the window, chases the attackers and guns them down. When he's about to kill the last one, he gets shot in the face by an unseen gunman. Following this scene there is a funeral for Mr. Gibson and members of the secret villain brotherhood that he was part of attend the funeral to discuss his death.</p><p>The story switches back to Wesley and his horrible life where he meets Fox, one of the people who was at the funeral. Fox opens fire on a sandwich shop Wesley is at and abducts him, taking him to the secret headquarters of the villains and telling him about his father. Wesley meets the Professor and learns that he himself has super powers.</p>",

The modern master of the done-in-one has done it again with November's installment of the long-running seriesUsagi Yojimbo. Usagi's sensei, Katsuichi, has led a remarkable life, but some of his choices would leave many samurai questioning his judgment. \"Bells\" recounts a formative event in young Katsuichi's life when, as a student, he courted the daughter of the master of a rival sword school. Katsuichi's pursuit of the girl does not sit well with Ikyu, the proud senior instructor who intends to marry her and inherit her family's school! With his public image threatened and his intent with the girl contested, Ikyu challenges the upstart Katshuichi to a duel, only to have Katsuichi decline the invitation. Facing public disgrace, and shouldering his new reputation as a coward, Katsuichi eventually earns the title of \"The Master.\" What happened that would allow such a title to be bestowed upon the misunderstood warrior?</em></p>",

            "description": "<p><i>A four-issue hard boiled noir crime thriller with girls, guns, fangs and aliens.</i></p><p><i>New York, 1929. The height of prohibition. The cops turn a blind eye while the mobs run the city, dealing in guns, girls and illegal liquor. But the arrival of the mysterious Dragonmir Family from Eastern Europe with more of a taste for blood then booze co-incides with a series of brutal attacks on the gangsters themselves. As the gangs fall before the fangs, only handful of mobsters survive. But an unlikely alliance formed between tough guy Eddie Falco and a character from a LONG way from New York City – a long way from Earth in fact - offers the humans a glimmer of hope. As the strong willed young reporter Susie Dale from the Gotham Herald tries to survive in the middle of the maelstrom, and an ancient prophecy unfolds, no one can guess who’s going to win the battle for this particular slice of Turf.</i></p><p>This issue was reprinted in Mark Millar's <a data-ref-id=\"4000-232065\" href=\"/clint-/4000-232065/\" slug=\"clint-\">CLiNT #1</a>.</p>",

It may well be his finest moment as a reporter, but Spider's expose will lead to a horrific--and very personal--climax.</i></p><p>Year of the Bastard, Part 6.</p><p>Spider begins practicing investigative journalism, something that is virtually unknown in the society he lives in. After he finds proof of his suspicions, he decides to confront the Smiler. Channon returns after discovering that life as a nun in the Church of Fred Christ wasn't particularly fulfilling, plus she's dug up some great dirt on The Smiler's campaign.. After confronting the Smiler, the Smiler's approval rating plummets and it seems like his campaign is over. Then, Spider's good friend Vita Severn, the Smiler's political director, is assassinated on live television. The Smiler's approval rating consequently gets a huge sympathy boost.</p>",

It's at that point, his boss tells him he's getting an assistant, he gets quite mad about that and stands up to go blast what he thinks will be some punk kid he can't work with with his Bowel Disruptor, but when he gets there...it's Channon Yarrow, an ex-stripper whom he had met before.</p><p>The two exchange a few brief words (basically Spider telling her everything he wants her to do), She comes back sometime later...this time, Spider's wearing pants. They discuss the world and more-so Spider's odd views on it as well as journalism etc.</p><p>Soon enough, the TV comes on with a message that the president will be coming to town. Spider immediately shouts out \"LETS GO SEE THE PRESIDENT\".</p><p>Spider and Channon then go out to town, he manages to get into the Presidents address and it isn't long before Spider snoops around and finds the president BEFORE the address..in the rest room of all places.</p><p>He's mumbling to himself about cheap Australian whores and having hard time peeing when Spider walks in, the two get into a war of words that eventually ends with Spider throwing him into a stall and using the \"Bowel Disruptor\" on him..set to \"Prolapse\".</p><p>Spider walks out and tells Channon they need to leave.</p><p>\"Why?\" she asked.</p><p>\"HELP! THE PRESIDENT'S SHAT HIMSELF!\" the Secret Service cried out.</p><p>Then Channon and Spider leave.</p>",

Franklin Boothe. (The Umbrella Academy does not approve of the term \"illegitimate child.\" Every child is legitimate; it's some parents we find to be lacking.) Through her varied career, she took on communism, sexism, and Nazism. When her friend, actress and legendary suicide Dorothy Hale, threw herself from the sixteenth floor of New York City's Hampshire House, Luce compelled art goddess Frida Kahlo to paint the shocking</em> <em>El Suicidio de Dorothy Hale. In 1953, President Eisenhower named Luce ambassador to Italy. When she met Pope Pius XII, Luce, ignoring America's own ethic about separation of church and state, explained the Church's moral requirement to be tougher on communism. Pope Pius replied, \"You know, Mrs. Ambassador, I am a Catholic, too.\" Seven years later, the United States would elect its first Catholic president.</em></p>",

Brought to you by award-winning writer JONATHAN HICKMAN and possibly the best new talent of the year, NICK PITARRA, THE MANHATTAN PROJECTS is a look at history through a darker, much stranger, lens.</i></p>",

The whole team is there along with just about everyone in several of the adjacent towns. It is a mysterious curiosity until it turns into horror. The ship opens and kills several people. Not knowing what to do the people sent an impromptu peace delegation. As they approach the ship an antenna protrudes from the ship and sets all the men on fire with some sort of invisible heat ray. After killing the peace delegation it turns on the civilians burning man, woman and child. The league being most likely the only survivors retreat to a town that is just about abandoned. All hope seems lost for the team. This gets worse when they are betrayed by one of their own.</p><h3>The New Traveller's Almanac Chapter Two</h3><p>This is a story of strange and unseal places around Europe. There are a lot of \"first hand accounts from Mina Murray and her travels. Some with assumably Allan Quatermain whom she refers to as simply A. There are also many accounts of Mr. and Mrs. Blakeney who travel with the notorious Mrs. Fanny Hill.</p>",

            "description": "<p><em>One hundred years ago, Bowen Tyler, a handful of British allies, and the crew of a German U-33 submarine were lost at sea. What they discovered was something that defied time, and all of known science: the island of Caspak! Hidden inside impregnable rock walls lay a prehistoric world, filled with terrifying creatures and murderous primitives from every era of time and evolution. Somehow, the island was never again found, and the stories of the survivors of Caspak were considered fantasy. Today, an expedition has been launched by Tyler's great granddaughter Abby, a quest to find concrete evidence of his adventure. But what she and her research team will uncover is something far deadlier and more shocking than they could ever have imagined, as the modern day explorers find themselves thrust into The Land That Time Forgot!</em></p><h4>List of covers and their creators:</h4><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Cover</th><th scope=\"col\">Name</th><th scope=\"col\">Creator(s)</th><th scope=\"col\">Sidebar Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reg</td><td>Regular Cover</td><td>Mike Wolfer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sub</td><td>Painted Subscription Cover</td><td>Chris Scalf</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>RI</td><td>1:3 Retailer Incentive Black &amp; White Variant Cover</td><td>Mike Wolfer</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Var</td><td>Blank Sketch Cover</td><td>None</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table>",

The two suspect that this man has been scamming the Franchetti Crime Family and decide on a whim that he would be better off dead. With that, Jackie turns on his red sports car, crushes the man's lower body with the car and then shoot him several times until he's dead.</p><p>He then goes to the bar where he meets <a href=\"/jenny-romano/4005-47571/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47571\">Jenny Romano</a> and asks for a glass of milk, much to the latter's surprise. He's then seen flirting with some of the girls inside the bar and eventually leaves with one of them, telling her that he can get her a walk-on part in <a href=\"/the-simpsons/4075-50/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-50\">The Simpsons</a>. Whilst he's at his home with the woman, the reader is introduced to <a href=\"/sonatine/4005-24346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24346\">Sonatine</a>, who is spying on him through a mystical source, as well as the current wielder of the <a href=\"/the-angelus/4005-43945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43945\">Angelus</a>, who wants to kill him the moment he gains <a href=\"/the-darkness/4015-45822/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-45822\">The Darkness</a>, hoping to end the Estacado family line once and for all.</p><p>The next day he meets up with Uncle Frankie, who is in the middle of dealing with some problems he having with some of his competitors. A Frag grenade gets thrown into the room and Jackie saves Don Franchetti by throwing <a href=\"/mo/4005-82742/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82742\">Mo</a> on top of it. He apologizes to the dying Mo, who tells Jackie not to worry about it and admits that he had betrayed the <a href=\"/the-franchetti-family/4060-50143/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50143\">Franchetti Family</a>. Later when he is seen loading his gun when, precisely at midnight, he starts hearing The Darkness for the first time, falling to the ground in intense pain. Two groups are then seen attacking Jackie. The first is the <a href=\"/the-brotherhood-of-darkness/4060-58956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58956\">Brotherhood of Darkness</a> and the second one is a group of the Angelus' warriors. The Brotherhood is easily overwhelmed by the latter group, which are eventually killed off by Jackie using the Darkness for the first time. An enforcer from a rival mafia family then enters and attempts to kill Jackie, but the Estacado manages to save himself by summoning his armor around his body and killing the intruder. He later goes to the mansion of <a href=\"/don-marchianni/4005-82743/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82743\">Don Marchianni</a> and manages to kill him by summoning Darkness up the toilet.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Rincewind the \"Wizzard\" lives in the city of fair Ankh-Morpork, a metropolis placed atop the Discworld, a flat earth being carried through space on the backs of four giant elephants, who in turn rest on the back of an even more gigantic celestial turtle, the Great A'Tuin. A failed mage, Rincewind only wants to have a peaceful and unexciting life. So it is extremely unfortunate for him when he runs into the Discworld's first tourist, Twoflower, come sightseeing to Ankh-Morpork from the fabled, and often believed to be mythical, Agatean Empire, accompanied by his homicidally sentient Luggage. As one of the few people able to communicate with Twoflower in a language the tourist understands, the extremely reluctant Rincewind finds himself forced to become Twoflower's guide by Ankh-Morpork's ruler, the Patrician, who fears the Agatean Emperor's wrath should something untoward befall a citizen of that empire within the bounds of crime-ridden Ankh-Morpork. Unfortunately for the city, Twoflower works in \"inn sewers ants\", and once he explains the concept of people agreeing to pay out if you make a bet with them that your business won't burn down, he inspires the first attempt at insurance fraud on the Disc.</p><p>As a result, the unlikely companions are forced to flee the burning city, and venture into the wilds beyond. Out of the frying pan, and into the fire...</p>",

But all is not well with mysterious millionaire John Godolkin's band of misfits. Silver Kincaid, one of the original G-Men, has just committed suicide in the most public and grotesque way imaginable. That's not good news for Vought-American's number one franchise, with G-Force, G-Coast, G-Style, G-Wiz, the G-Brits and the G-Nomads all depending on their slice of the G-pie. There's far too much at stake for anyone to go poking around the G-Mansion now. Who knows what dirty secrets might be waiting down there in the dark? So it's just too bad that Butcher, Hughie, Mother's Milk, the Frenchman and the Female have decided to do precisely that. Even it they risk finally biting off much, much more than they can chew...</i></p>",

Meanwhile, Annie January (alias Starlight) has her own doubts about membership of The Seven. This storyline also reveals a little more about the other members of the team- beginning with Butcher, and his relationship with CIA director Susan Rayner.</i></p><p>Starlight is sitting in a church and wants to know if God is out there or not. She can't understand the things she's had to go through lately since joining the Seven. She figures that if God is there, he must be sadistic. She has really been let down since seeing that the Seven don't really do much to save others. It's mainly been about corporate sponsorship.</p><p>Butcher has more sex with Director Rayner. She continues to curse and tell him she hates him the entire time.</p><p>Wee Hughie visits the Legend. The Legend informs him that the Blarney Cock is back in town. Hughie is shocked because he was the one that accidentally killed him after first getting Compound V in his system. The Legend tells him that this happens from time to time. Capes die all the time but have so much Compound V in them that it simply jump-starts their bodies. The Legend tells Hughie he has to kill him again. When they come back, their minds aren't really there. Plus Butcher wants it known that when the Boys kill someone, they stay killed. He also tells Hughie to do it as a favor for him. Hughie says he'll do it but then wants all his questions about the Boys answered. The Legend agrees, saying he's earned the right to know where he stands.</p><p>Starlight travels back home to visit her former teammates, the Young Americans. Arriving unannounced, she walks in on Drummer Boy having sex with Holy Mary. He claimed he was lonely and didn't know if she was coming back or not. Everything she's known, her heroes, her friends, and maybe even her god have been a lie. Thinking that perhaps God isn't there, she leaves the church. In the park, she runs into Wee Hughie and falls, in tears, into his arms.</p>",

Find out for yourself why everyone's been talking about The Boys!</em></p><p>Tek Knight, a hero of the super-team, Payback visits a psychiatrist. He has developed a problem in which he wants to have relations with anything he can. After a false tip to capture a terrorist army, Payback was flying back to their headquarters. He became aware of fellow teammate and robot, Mind-Droid's rear end. He tried having relations with him in mid-flight and was suspended from the team. He has gone on to make attempts on several other things. He finally gets kicked out of the doctor's office and told never to return when he tried to have his way with the doctor's coffee cup when he left to answer the phone.</p><p>Wee Hughie is called in to see Butcher. He finds the rest of the Boys sitting around. He is surprised that Frenchman and the Female are just playing Monopoly on a Cluedo board. Mother's Milk tells him that they're both crazy and are waiting to put the hurt on someone else. Wee Hughie then receives a black overcoat similar to what the others all wear. He now really feels like part of the team.</p><p>Hughie meets with Butcher and they discuss the coat. Butcher tells him that if they get in a fight to just hit anything not wearing one. They arrive at Vinnie's Comics. As they wait to meet with The Legend, Butcher tells Hughie the secrets of the real heroes. Comic books are just a front. The truth is the supes all pretty much have their dark secrets. Butcher says that they are an asset to them because they wouldn't be able to blackmail the supes if the truth was made public.</p><p>When Butcher introduces Hughie to the Legend, they are given what will become their next case. The Legend's sister's grandson was recently thrown off a rooftop and the police are not doing much to find out who is responsible. The Legend says that the supe known as Swingwing is involved. Swingwing was Tek Knight's first Laddio, his sidekick.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tek Knight is doing all he can to resist the temptation of the current Laddio. When Laddio wants to have a workout and bends over to do some streches in front of Tek Knight, he knows he needs to send him off. Tek Knight is left wondering who he can get to help him with his problem.</p>",

            "description": "<p> Tim seems to be wandering through a strange land in the midst of a massive storm, and sees a magical tower.  He finds a man there, who lets him in and says he himself can now leave.  He says Tim is the storm, and that he is not ready for what he will find.  Tim says he can't wait, because his father needs him (not knowing he is dead).</p><p>Inside, he finds a spider with a woman's head, who calls herself one of \"We Who Wat.\" She says Tim will come to this tower 5 times, and asks what he wants.  He wants his power, and she says that while his magic is everywhere, his power is below.  The floor falls out into an abyss, and as he falls, she says he must name the place he is.</p><p>Back in the real world, Thomas Currie finds Tim in a semi-conscious state, hung by wires to the magical machine that contains his magic; Tim is being drowned by the immensity of his magic.  Tim says the serpent in the abyss is named Chylde.</p><p>Currie considers killing him, or letting him die, but in the end alters the machine's cords to let the magic flow more controllably into Tim, so he will be OK.</p><p>Cyril goes back to Bardsey, but is humiliated in front of everyone when the headmaster informs him that they know he had been cooking the books, and that his tuition was not paid.  He is no longer a Bardsey boy, which is all he had wanted to be.</p><p>Thomas tells Tim that they must create another copy of Tim, and give him a bit of his magic, so the Other can kill him.  Then the Other will think he has won, and won't look for the real Tim.  Once the Other becomes the \"real\" Tim, he will make the mistakes that Sir Timothy once told Molly would happen to Tim--selling his memories to demons--and eventually become Sir Timothy.  The actual real Tim will be saved from these consequences.</p><p>Thomas then lies to Tim and makes it sound like Tim's dad killed himself.  The trauma of hearing this causes Tim to split off a bit of himself, as he used to do when he created multiple worlds. But now Thomas captures that split-off energy and uses it to make the copy-Tim.</p><p>When Cyril goes home, he finds an eviction notice.  He blames Tim for all his problems, obsessing about being kicked out of Bardsey.</p><p>Cyril breaks into Tim's old house using a ladder, where Tim and Thomas are downstairs.  He finds Thomas's glamour stone, and after putting it on looks like a troll.  He urinates on the bed, to soil it.</p><p>Thomas tells Tim they need to once again put his magic in a container and hide it from the Other. Tim, frustrated, asks if Thomas can't just kill him to end the Other as well--as Thomas was going to do earlier when Tim was unconscious.  Thomas says he'll do it if Tim wants, but Tim says he wants to live.</p><p>Cyril accidentally kicks a bottle downstairs, and Thomas picks it up to use as the container for the magic.  They put the magic in it.  Thomas says he'll help the copy-Tim against the Other, then will meet Tim later.</p><p>Cyril leaves, saying he's tired of magic.</p><p>Thomas says the magic Tim has lost is just his natural Opener ability--he can still learn normal magic just like anyone else.  Thomas says he will hide the bottle so Tim can find it later. Thomas thinks that Tim is unworthy of being his creator, but by letting him live, he hopes that Tim will grow into worthiness.  He must now choose who he is.</p>",

However, he also finds his father, who last issue woke up with his magic arm fallen off.  He has gotten drunk.  At first Tim thinks it's because of Holly's death, but then he sees that his dad had bandaged the arm to his body.  When he takes the bandages off, the arm falls off again,then turns to dust.  Tim runs off to get help.</p><p>Tim gets him to the hospital, but when they hear about the arm, and that his face was also healed of major burns by Vasuki, they think it's all a delusion on Bill's part.  They say he is going to be committed to an institution for the insane.</p><p>Tim blames himself for all of it--that his father needed Vasuki in the first place, that Tim wasn't there for Bill when Holly died, instead being with Thomas re-learning magic.</p><p>Thomas shows up with his clothes on backwards to hide his presence.  He tells Tim that the Other is here.</p><p>They realize that when Bill said he saw Tim before the car crash, he actually saw the Other.  Now Tim blames the Other for the accident.</p><p>Back at Tim's original house, Thomas makes him some tea.  He says Tim is not ready to reclaim his magic and fight the Other, who has absorbed all the magic from all the other Tims that were splintered off among the other worlds.</p><p>Thomas's plan is to let the Other think he took Tim's place, and become this reality's Tim until the true Tim is ready to fight him.  Tim refuses.  However, Thoimas drugged the tea.</p><p>Tim passes out.  Thomas, in his diaries, writes at how displeased he is with Tim.  He is not up to Thomas's standards, due to his constant changing of his mind, his hypocrisy, his self-centeredness. He is further unhappy that this weak child is the creature that created him, for what does that say about himself? Thomas will act without him.</p><p>When Tim wakes up, he sees Molly's letter and reads it, realizing that Molly wrote it thinking that the Other was Tim.  Tim refuses to let Molly be hurt by the Other.  He goes to the room where his magic is kept, and takes it back, saying (more maturely than normal) that magic requires sacrifice.</p><p>Thomas goes to Bill's hospital room.  Bill wakes up, and worries that he scared Tim.  Thomas hypnotizes him, and either has him jump out the window, or throws him out.  Bill is, after years of unhappiness, dead.  Currie says that he would do anything to stop the Other, including things that people who have not seen worlds be destroyed would not do.  That is his sacrifice.</p><p>In the back-up story, a long time ago in Faerie, a girl whose family mistreats her runs along a beach.  She looks for the boy she has been meeting lately.  They talk of running away together, but then his magical guise falls away, and she sees that he's a kelpie--a creature that can turn into a horse or a man, that seduces girls and then drowns them.</p><p>He says that he's not like the others, and that he loves her.  She makes him promise to stay human, and to bring her to his land safely.  He promises, and they swim off.</p><p>The next morning, her drowned body washes up on shore.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Tim, Bill, and Cyril are at Holly's funeral.  Auntie Blodwyn is also there, and her face is seen for the first time.  She confuses Holly with Molly, who she thought was the one they were there to mourn (Tim has not yet learned that Molly met the Other).</p><p>Tim talks to Davis, his friend from school, who tells him that he heard that Holly had not been paying the tuition bill, and that Tim and Cyril are going to be expelled.  Apparently Cyril knew, and was fixing the books so it looked like they were paid up.  Cyril may have been taking the money for himself.</p><p>Shirley Tinch, Holly's friend from last issue, shows up and talks with Bill, but Holly had never mentioned her to Bill.  They both feel her loss.</p><p>The next day, Tim passes by his original house, but almost misses it until Thomas Currie calls him back.  He has covered it with wards so magical and normal sight can't see it easily.  Currie has turned the house into a vacuum that is sucking up the remains of Tim's old magic.</p><p>He explains that magic is a truth, and truth depends on one's perspective. So even though Tim did give away his magic, simultaneously he cannot give it away because it is him, and one day he will be able to reclaim the magic that is collected in the house.</p><p>Bill goes to talk to a lawyer about Holly's estate.  He is horrified to hear that not only does no one know who Cyril's father was--because Bill would optimally not like to keep him--but that Holly had almost no money and her insurance policy was paid to Lloyd, the man she had an affair with as described in last issue.</p><p>Bill does tell Cyril that they will all stay together, and the kids will stay at Bardsey, because he doesn't know about the tuition problems.  Bill is once again despondent as he was when Mary died.  Tim doesn't want to break the truth to him so he says that Cyril should stay home for relaxation's sake.</p><p>Thomas turns the Hunter's old TV into a scrying device so they can see the other worlds, but none of them are showing up on the channels.  Tim asks why he can't take his magic back now, and Thomas says it would kill him; he needs to learn the skills of magic now, instead of doing it by instinct.</p><p>Thomas says they are in a hurry, because Tim must become good enough to learn to use magic fully before the Other arrives--which he thinks may be years from now.</p><p>Bill finally hears about the tuition from a phone message.  He sits in a chair in dismay, as he did all the time while Tim was growing up.  He tests Tim on this when he gets home--he asks Tim how school was, knowing he wasn't there, and is disappointed when Tim lies and says he was.  Bill decides he has failed Tim, but won't fail Cyril.  He does manage to not drink any alcohol.  However, when he wakes up the next day, his magic arm, gained from demons, has fallen off.</p><p>Thomas realizes that the TV is working--there simply are no other worlds any more.  He knows the Other has arrived.</p><p>In the back-up story, a long time ago, Dymphna and Bridey await the return of the boy Auberon in Faerie.  He brings a strange creature home.  They decide it could be safe, and he names it Gyvv.  That night, the women forget to put their traditional spell of protection on Auberon, and evil creatures show up at his window.</p><p>Gyvv, however, defeats them.</p><p>In the morning, Dymphna and Bridey realize that they forgot to put on the spell, and rush in fear to his room.  They find him sleeping peacefully, but also find evidence of wood goblins.  They say that only a Fotch could stop them, and while they do not know what a Fotch looks like, perhaps Gyvv is one.</p>",

He calls up a version of the Wobbly to see if there is anything useful, and decides that Bill and Cyril are not.  He is interested to see Holly, whom he has never seen a version of before.</p><p>Holly, hallucinating, tells him a story:</p><p>Some time ago, she met her friend, Shirley Tinch.  She told her about meeting Bill for the first time, how she felt sorry for him in his bandages.  Her friend, however, is more interested in whether she talked with Lloyd, a man with whom she'd been having an affair.  She had planned to ask him to get married, since she's pregnant, but when she showed up at his house, she met his wife.</p><p>Shirley is a strong proponent of Holly standing up for herself, which she often does not do.  She plans to have an abortion, unlike what she did when pregnant with Cyril, which was also on her own.  However, unlike her friend, she is unable to live on her own.  After a flip remark, she decides to date the man she is least attracted to: Bill.</p><p>However, more events get in the way: Lloyd now wants to talk, and she fantastizes that they will get back together.  Shirley tries to be there for her friend, even though she knows she's making a mistake.</p><p>Holly does manage to end her relationship with Lloyd, but then meets Bill again, and thinks it will work because Bill really needs her.  Shirley can't take what she sees as another bad decision.  She makes a bet with Holly that it won't work with Bill, with their friendship being the wager.</p><p>Over time, Holly keeps writing Shirley letters and leaving messages on the phone, talking about the ups and downs of her life with Bill, Cyril, and Tim.  She wants to regain their friendship as well.  Shirley listens with some hope, but can see the writing on the wall as problems arise (mostly due to Tim, really, not Bill).  She is crushed by the fact that things turn out badly, as she knew they would.</p><p>We return to the present, and Holly dies--the second wife of Bill Hunter to do so in a car accident.  The Other gives Cyril a spark from his mother's life.</p><p>Tim and Thomas are working together, and Tim says that he might be getting along better with Holly when his hand automatically writes himself a note saying that she is dead.</p><p>In the back-up story, a \"Tale from the Book of Faerie,\" a troll, Sturm, the youngest of three brothers, goes off in search of gold.</p><p>He finds his first brother's head on a stick in the forest, and brings it along in a bag.</p><p>He finds his second brother's head in much the same way.</p><p>He finally runs into a lady, who says she lost her silver treasure in a pond.  She gives him a gauntlet that will let him breathe underwater.  There he finds a silver serpent, which he grabs and brings out.</p><p>She explains that his brothers also tried to get the snake, but hurt it in the process, and so they died.  In return for his help in getting the snake unharmed, she brings his brothers back to life.</p>",

Tim has successfully scared Cyril off of making life hard for Tim at school, partly by making Cyril the new target for the school bullies.  Meanwhile, Tim takes off to learn more about his Other, and the worlds he created, with Thomas Currie, letting Cyril have the run of the school.  Tim now hopes to regain his magic so he can use it to battle the Other.</p><p>Molly, who has not been seen for a long time, shows up at home; she had been staying with her Gran.

After Tim destroyed the army men figures, they're all worried he destroy them too.</p><p>Awn the Blink made them all a hiding place in the cellar, behind the walls.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Other has arrived, and he starts to torture a gargoyle, who, like the ones in California, is a secret-keeper.

He beats up the brothers, and she comes out.  He acts brash, and she is annoyed.  He wants to force her to go for ice cream.  She fights back.  He thinks she's the best Molly.</p><p>Happy smacks him down.  Molly asks if he's been talking to demons, since that's specifically what she made the true Tim promise not to do.  He says of course, so she says she never wants to see him again, still thinking he's the real Tim.  The Other is left outside, and can't do anything to Happy or Tim will know.</p><p>Molly tells Tim's creatures they can all stay with her, and writes Tim a letter, saying that they are over forever, and explains exactly how he will sell a soul to a demon and become the evil Future Tim, aka Sir Timothy.</p><p>As the Other leaves, surprised to find Happy since the gargoyle told him that Tim had given up his magic, he runs into In-the-No, who wants to help him get rid of Tim.</p><p>Unfortunately, Holly, Bill, and Cyril are driving by their old house right as the Other walks away from Molly's.  They're so surprised to see \"Tim\" there that Holly runs the car off the road, creating a terrible accident.</p>",

He gives Tim a letter.</p><p>The letter explains that he comes from a world where magic reigns, and where the world was created to fit the resolution of Tim's dreams.  There, Currie was a teacher to that world's Tim, a skilled sorcerer.  In this world, his mother Mary was still alive and he was still romantically paired with Molly.  Tim gets along with Titania and the still-living Tamlin, and along with creations like In-the-No and the Wobbly.</p><p>They're all having a party, except Molly, when the Wobbly falls--the kingdom is under attack.  They go to the roof and see that Molly is fleeing from a being who is mounted on the Manticore.  The being takes off his hood--it is the Other.  He and his creatures kill Molly and Tamlin, who had flown out to save her.</p><p>Various members of the group elect to defend the castle while Tim takes the time to cast a spell to protect them, but they fall one by one.  He casts the spell, but a bolt blasts it apart and wounds Currie.  The Other arrives; he believes this is the true Tim.  He kills him, and absorbs his magic, but realizes it is not the true Tim.  Currie, however, was protected enough by Tim's spell to survive when all the rest of the world is destroyed, and he escapes before the Other can kill him.  He then begins to go from world to world, looking for the true Tim.</p><p>Tim finishes reading the letter.  Currie tells him that he is a creation of Tim's, from a world that he created.  Tim says he believes him.</p><p> </p>",

He puts on the necklace that he found in her grave a couple issues ago. When his dad opens the door, he sees that Tim looks like his mom, Mary--the necklace is a Glamour Stone that made the wearer look like that; his mother was seemingly not really who she seemed to be. Bill does a double take and Tim takes off the necklace before he notices.</p><p>Cyril continues to talk with the dead teacher's body that he is secretly hiding in the school's basement. He wants to kill Tim, maybe by poison. He has a new plan to discredit Mr. Currie. He tells the principal the rumor he has already spread among the boys, that Currie is gay and sleeping with Tim. The principal confronts Currie, without being specific about the charge against him.</p><p>Some of the other boys threaten to beat up Tim for his perceived homosexuality, but the actually gay Davis saves him by photographing them in the act and blackmailing them. Davis explains that he and the other gay students are all from rich and powerful families whose parents are hiding them away from high society, since Bardsey is a second class school, while the other boys are just middle-class. they know Tim is straight, but like him since the other kids hate him.</p><p>Cyril continues to talk about his insane fantasies of being King of the Dead, tipping off Currie and Tim that he is the one behind the rumors about both of them.  Currie contacts Tim and says he is a teacher. Tim isn't interested in being taught, but agrees to work with Currie to find Cyril's \"land of the dead.\"</p><p>Tim puts stars on Cyril's shoes, which allows him to track him.  They find the body of the teacher Cyril has been hiding.  They take the body out with the assistance of Davis and his friends, who are happy to be involved in a scheme like this.  They dump it in the Thames, so it looks like he committed suicide.</p><p>Currie resigns over the rumors about him and Cyril, but as Tim explains, now Cyril is in trouble with the bullying kids, because they think he agreed to sleep with Currie.</p><p>Currie decides that it is time to tell Tim that he is not a Faerie or troll, but from one of the world's that Tim created, and thus one of Tim's own creations.</p>",

Another Tim, presumably the Other, watches.</p><p>The true Tim gets ready for his new school, Bardsey, which he will be attending with Cyril.  He is frustrated with having to wear a tie.</p><p>The school's head tours Thomas Currie around, who is replacing one of the teachers who went mysteriously missing.</p><p>When Tim and Cyril arrive at school, Cyril seems to have a strange influence over the other boys, getting them to do what he says in return for being allowed to see an unknown \"it.\"</p><p>He walks the boys through a tunnel under the school and shows them \"it\": the dead body of the missing teacher, which he keeps from smelling too badly with car air fresheners.  Cyril has obviously gone nuts, and wears a skull mask.</p><p>Currie teaches a class with Tim in it, and tries to learn about him via questions that are ostensibly about the curriculum.  He thinks Tim seems naive and foolish.  When Cyril volunteers to talk about what he would do if he were a god, he has a megalomaniacal vision similar to what he did when he was an \"angel\" earlier; he says he wants to be the King of the Dead.</p><p>Currie is confused, because Tim shows no sign of power--because he gave his magic up.  Cyril is jealous because Currie ignores him.  Cyril talks with the dead teacher about his \"problems.\"</p><p>Currie intentionally runs into Tim at a market later on.  They watch a street magician, and Currie says he knows some real magic.  Tim doesn't believe him, but goes along with it.  Currie has Tim close his eyes, and imagine colors.  As he does, Tim unknowingly makes objects of those colors appear in reality, despite the fact that he thinks he gave up magic.  When he opens his eyes, he has The Sight, and can see all the traces of magic in reality.</p><p>However, when he looks at Currie, he sees the illusion of the Glamour Stone now, and realizes Currie is magic.  However, he thinks the troll form is Currie's true form.  Assuming Currie is trying to manipulate him to get his magic, Tim stomps off.</p><p>Currie gets more and more worried about this Tim.  He hoped he would be good and skilled, but instead he has no skill and was not raised with good ethics about his magic.</p><p>When Tim returns to school, he runs into Davis, a boy that avoided him earlier. Davis says that everyone believes Tim and Currie are having a sexual fling, and that people also think Currie killed the teacher he replaced (which is a rumor Cyril created).  Because of a misunderstanding of the term \"fairy,\" by which Davis means \"gay\" and Tim means \"Faerie,\" Tim agrees that Curry is a \"fairy\" and he might be one himself.  Davis is actually gay, and upon thinking that Tim is too, he invites Tim to hang out with him and his other gay friends, since Cyril has ostracized Tim from all the other boys.</p>",

The world ends in a blast of magic.</p><p>Tim's dad and his new wife Holly, and her son Cyril walk around the zoo, wondering where Tim has gotten to (Tim's time in Leah's box took no time in our world).  Apparently Holly and Cyril did not spend a lot of time getting therapy in America.</p><p>Thomas Currie has arrived in the true Tim's reality, and shows up at Tim's original home. His neighbors tell Currie that Bill married Holly recently, that his original wife, Mary, died years ago, and that they all moved away.</p><p>Bill finds Tim and tells him that they want to send him to Bardsey, a fancy boarding school; Holly will pay for it. Tim is very unhappy about this, especially when he learns that Cyril will be in the same grade. Bill knows it will be hard, so he tells him he can skip out of the rest of the family outing and go back to their original home to talk to his old friends about it.</p><p>As Tim travels there on the bus, he thinks that he feels even less at home than he did in the US or Faerie. He also wants to see Molly, but knows he can't. He wants to be normal.</p><p>Thomas goes to Faerie to get more help on his mission to stop the Other and warn Tim. He is concerned, because on other worlds, his late mother is usually very important in teaching Tim to use his magic wisely.</p><p>Currie traps a troll in a magic circle. He bargains with him to get his Glamour Stone; with it, he looks like a giant troll, but without it the troll is small. Now Currie can look like the troll.</p><p>Tim arrives home to find a sign that says it's for sale, which his dad had not told him. He is angry, and talks with his magical creation, In-the-No about it. In-the-No wants to be free of the neighborhood, where's Tim's magic traps him. Tim says he can't free him because he doesn't have magic any more; it tells him that it knows secrets about Molly. It also says that the other kids in the neighborhood only played with him because Jimmy made them, and that his body was eventually found in the ocean.</p><p>As Tim walks off, some of the toy plastic army men that he brought to life follow him.</p><p>Some of Molly's brothers find Tim. They angrily confront him, saying that he changed her, and that she went to live in Ireland. He fights back, and the army men take his side, shooting at the brothers. Tim angrily destroys the soldiers, saying he doesn't want them in his life any more. The brothers know that Molly is cursed by the Fairies, and can't eat or walk on the ground, and Tim is frustrated that he didn't try to help her when he still had magic. He leaves.</p><p>Currie watches Tim cold-heartedly destroy his creations, and talks with In-the-No about him.</p><p>He later arrives at Bardsey, Tim and Cyril's new school, where he takes a job as a teacher.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Titania visits Lucien in a library in the Dreaming, where books that were dreamed of, but not written, reside.  Titania is a habitue of the library, and loves its variety, but never learned to read true, physical books.</p><p>Lucien shows her a copy of the Books of Magic, about Tim's life, but it begins to burn in her hands, for someone in reality has begin to actually write it.  They do not know its author, but it is by Thomas Currie.</p><p>Currie explains that Openers, like Tim, create worlds.  When they are young, they do so by instinct, often when in pain or confusion: they create a world slightly different from their own, often related to the thing that caused the pain.  Their memory related to that incident also disappears, and a bit of their soul goes to the new world.</p><p>Currie says that Openers who are trained early on don't lose too much of their selves, but if they are not trained, they can lose their identity due to the missing pieces, and cause terrible problems.  He also says that an Opener must have, and meet, his Other--who earlier in the series was said to be Molly, and was implied to be the person who made the Opener feel whole through love, and create stability for him in that way.</p><p>We see a version of Tim from one of these other worlds, where he avoids the Trenchcoat Brigade and never learns magic.  At home, he finds a leather jacket and sunglasses-wearing version of himself, who have just carved up his mother and father with a knife.  This is the Other--a version of Tim who found out about his other selves, and is killing them one by one to gain their bit of magic, so that he can eventually confront the true Tim.</p><p>The Other stabs this world's Tim, explaining that almost all of the Tim's who had not lost their mother in the car crash don't take up magic.  The Other absorbs his natural ability.</p><p>The true Tim visits a book shop, and sells off his old fantasy books; he no longer feels connected to their made-up worlds.</p><p>Then he visits his mother's grave, and talks to her about recent events.  Titania suddenly appears, and says she will give him the Mundane Egg, first seen in the original miniseries, freely.  He doesn't trust her, and knocks the egg away, breaking it.  Titania explains that he has destroyed a potential world.  He likes the feeling of magic that envelops him from it.  She leaves in anger, saying that a storm is coming, and she won't help any more.</p><p>When she leaves, a lightning bolt falls down and splits his mother's grave, spilling her bones all over.  Tim is distraught, and tries to push them back in place.  As he does, he finds a necklace that she always wore.</p><p>This necklace is a Glamour Stone, which makes someone appear differently from their true appearance.  We see, although Tim does not, that his \"mother's\" skull is decidedly inhuman, with fangs.</p><p>Tim walks off with the necklace.</p><p>Thomas Currie, in the Inn Between, talks with a young woman, Joh.  He is leaving the Inn Between to find the true Tim, to warn him about the Other.  And if he believes that Tim cannot kill the Other, then Thomas will kill Tim, thus destroying all of his creations, including the Other, thus saving reality.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The last issue written by Neiber.</p><p>Holly, Tim's dad's girlfriend, goes to the US for therapy due to their recent events; she doesn't remember anything, but has subconscious effects. Tim characterizes her as the kind of person most people don't notice. He notes that she finally admitted that Cyril has some problems, and he is also going to be temporarily institutionalized.</p><p>Tim, finally free for the first time in a while, and haven given up his magic, goes skating, and runs across Leah's old box, where she was trapped for centuries before Tim finally let her out.</p><p>Tim is sucked in. Leah picks up the box and says that trapping Tim in was the cruelest and fairest punishment she could devise.</p><p>Tim finds himself on a square floor, inexplicably in the midst of a jungle, which is populated by small gliding mammals. He is unable to walk past the square.</p><p>Tim dreams of various enemies from the past, saying they could have saved his soul. He wakes to find nothing.</p><p>Seasons pass. He spends his time writing in the dust, trying to avoid insanity. EVen more time passes--years. He is an adult, and comes to terms with his confinement, to a degree. A seed falls onto his square from above, and begins to grow into a tree; Tim weeps for its presence.</p><p>Tim is now an old man, and the tree has grown huge. He ponders his inability to get along with others, the way he never got too close to people.</p><p>One of the small gliders climbs down the tree; one has never come down to the square before. Tim is joyous. It runs off, despite his promise not to hurt it. The ghosts from his dream come back, saying that now that he has made a promise he can keep, their spirits are free.</p><p>The jungle begins to burn. Tim tries to protect his one tree, and calls on his absent magic to do so, but only a single raindrop falls.</p><p>Leah shows up, and the fire ends. She says he gets so focused on little things, like the tree, that he misses the big things--like when she turned to an elemental to save him. She is angry that he never looked for her. She rejuvenates him to his youth, and explains that he is the one who made this place, and that he couldn't actually get rid of his magic, because his magic is him.</p><p>It should be noted that this event, in which Tim has aged--on the inside, even if his body is reverted--for at least decades, and gained peace and maturity, is rarely if ever brought up again. It is similarly notable for Leah's seemingly out of character desire to punish him (although it is true that Tim didn't look for her), especially since she is now ostensibly an ego-less elemental. Their relationship is not revisited.</p><p>A back-up feature, excerpting several pages from the next issue, is also included. Titania meets with Lucien in a library in the Dreaming, and finds the Book of Magic--the story of Tim's life. However, it begins to burn in her hands. They do not know who wrote it, but we see him from behind--Thomas Currie.</p>",

Tim rebuilds him, without magic.  They task Awn with rebuilding Slaggingham, and then together building Slaggingham's traps. They intend to catch both women--the one with a star halo, who Tim refers to as \"Our Lady of Bad Eye Makeup\"--and the Queen of Wounds (the nun). He implies that the star-halo lady is responsible for Cyril and turning his dad and Araquel into chocolate, and the Queen of Wounds is responsible for originally turning his dad into a monster.</p><p>It somehow seems that the Queens want him to build these traps, but only to catch the other one.</p><p>Awn puts Slaggingham's head on the trap, which looks like a globe-shaped ferris wheel with venus flytrap seats.</p><p>Circe brings Tim some ice cream, his classic treat to get with Molly.

Against his better wishes, Uriel tells Cyril (whom he loathes) that he is a saint, and Cyril is indeed transformed: he and four of his toys are given halos.</p><p>Araquel sees Tim's dad, now transformed into a monster by Vasuki, shambling outside. Tim and Araquel speed after him to stop him from hurting anyone.</p><p>Cyril runs into his mom's room to brag about his halo, but she is horrified by what happened to Bill. Tired of being ignored, Cyril's toy Chocozilla turns her into a chocolate statue.</p><p>The angel Mesukiel welcomes back Uriel after his mission. Uriel is unhappy with what he did, and considers it more worthy of a demon, but Uriel is more interested in whether it furthers their ends.</p><p>Mesukiel collects more angels to bind Uriel for his \"sins\" of transgression. Clearly the line between angel and demon is getting very fuzzy. Then Bill Hunter, in monster form, shows up at attack them.</p><p>Cyril doesn't want his mother to be dead, and the toys convince him that he can save her by attacking Tim. They enchant him to become even more slavish in his religious leanings. He looks forward to the apocalypse.</p><p>Araquel and Tim follow the tracks of Tim's dad. Tim doesn't know what to do since he no longer has magic. They come across the dead Uriel and Mesukiel. Vasuki is there. He seems to imply that the demons want Earth to be another Heaven so the demons can live there instead of Hell--it can be their own idea of what Heaven ought to be. Tim and Araquel, not surprisingly, are not in favor of this.</p>",

They are finally wed, when Vasuki introduces himself to Tim and Araquel.  Vasuki was the doctor who healed Bill's face from its burns back in issue 14.</p><p>Circe, who gave Tim his tattoos (now gone) and was also seen quite some time ago, continues to change people into animals in order to improve their personalities and approach to life, but when various things go wrong with some of her pidgeon-people, she starts wondering if she is using the right approach. Something seems strange to her today.</p><p>Araquel can immediately sense something is off about Vasuki. Vasuki says he knows why there is a war in heaven.</p><p>Circe runs into Slaggingham, who is rambling on about the apocalypse. They both see the dead angels and demons littered all over the place from the war (although normal people can't see them).</p><p>Vasuki is cordial at the wedding as the bride and groom leave, and explains the source of the war: the devils want to make it a heaven, and the angels want to make it a hell, although he doesn't really explain why. He turns into a giant snake, and says he expects Tim to work with him for the Queen of Wounds, who will have a list of people for him to kill. Then he leaves.</p><p>Circe and Slaggingham argue about their religions' ideas of the afterlife and the end of the world, but Circe eventually agrees to go along with Slaggingham and see if his apocalyptic visions are real.</p><p>Two angels, Uriel and Mesukiel, sit outside the reception for Bill and Holly's wedding.  The revelers inside are having a ball, even Araquel and Auntie Blodwyn--although Cyril is busy putting up protective wards made of turkey gravy under the table. While the angels despise Cyril's shallow and pathetic understanding of their religion, they have a plan to use him as a tool to further their plans.  Uriel, the one who has to carry it out, is conflicted over whether this is really the right thing to do.</p><p>Tim and his dad have a good talk and get past their differences.</p><p>That night, Vasuki calls to Bill, who is magically transformed and slithers out the window.</p><p> </p>",

            "description": "<p><i>Part 1 of the 6-part \"Slave of Heavens.\" Tim has released his power into the world with hopes of making it a better place for everyone to live -- but when he learns that the magic he's given up has been stolen by the same changeling who has stolen his face, his past, and his family, he returns to London to confront the thief. Unfortunately, that thief is now quite possibly the most powerful magician of the age, and he would like nothing better than to see Tim dead.</i></p><p>The wedding between Bill Hunter and Holly has finally arrived, and so has the mysterious wedding guest, Tim's Auntie Blodwyn, mentioned once or twice before; she is shown here only in a veil, her face jokingly never revealed.</p><p>Tensions between Tim (actually the changeling) and Cyril increase; Cyril is turning increasingly Christian-extremist and thinks Tim is a tool of Satan.</p><p>Tim and Araquel must figure out how to escape the Dark Tower now that Tim released all his magic. Not knowing what else to do, Araquel picks up Tim and they fly upwards.</p><p>The giant wave of Tim's released magic flashes through the church as the wedding ceremony is performed. It focuses on the changeling-Tim, whose true form is revealed. Cyril is now even more convinced that he is evil.</p><p>Tim and Araquel take a rest, and Tim wonders if they're going the right way. Acting on a whim, he jumps off the stairs into the black abyss, and Araquel follows.</p><p>They show up in a cornfield, where Charon agrees to fly them to the land of the living in his classic biplane, after Araquel does a little convincing with his fiery sword.</p><p>The changeling, who is now accompanied by the Wobbly, tries to convince the family that he is really Tim, at least partly out of his own desires to believe so. The Wobbly, who was orchestrating this whole event, tries to convince the changeling to discard the family so he can get rid of them.</p><p>As they fly, Araquel explains to Tim that the reason Charon has a plane and not a boat has to do with Tim's early childhood ideas of death, gained from watching TV. His released magic has changed \"reality.\" Araquel also has to stop Tim from eating the in-flight peanuts, which would keep him in the land of the dead like Persephone's seeds.</p><p>They land outside the church and confront the changeling and Wobbly. Cyril is even more jealous when he sees that Tim has an angel, like the ultra-religious Cyril wants to have. The changeling uses Tim's magic, which he now controls, to bind both the Wobbly and Tim. He says he never wanted what the Wobbly was pushing on him, and destroys the Wobbly. He releases Tim, but says he's going to keep the magic.</p><p>Tim pretends to be OK with that, and offers some peanuts in friendship to the emotionally-needy changeling. He eats them, and is killed by the nuts of the dead. Araquel remarks on Tim's premeditated murder of the changeling.</p>",

He sees a vision of a man planning a school shooting, and a young girl about to be sold into sexual slavery, and can't do anything about it because there is just too much for him to keep track of, or do something about.  He wonders about how people can be so terrible.</p><p>He comes to himself when Araquel flies down, and it starts to rain blood.  Araquel touches the Stone, and it unravels itself from his neck and falls into the bloody water. Tim asks whose blood this is, and Araquel points to the sky--it belongs to a warring mass of angels and devils fighting over access to Tim.</p><p>They fly down, and threaten Araquel, whom they (angels and devils) both consider a traitor.  Araquel slaughters them easily. Araquel says there's nowhere on Earth they can hide, so Tim takes them to the Dark Tower, an edifice whose inhabitants have long been rumored to have it in for Tim.</p><p>They are on a long thin staircase in the dark, with nothing around them but skeletons who are eating the stairs.

Instead, he finally understands what it means to be an Opener--the magic isn't in himself, he is just able to Open the world to the realm and power of magic.</p><p>He returns to Araquel, and Opens himself as a portal fully, releasing all his magic back into the magic-starved world.

Two owls fly by, one white and one black. The white one transforms to Tim, who Bill is strangely not at all shocked to see, and he greets the other as Yo-yo, Tim's owl that died back in the original mini-series (and which Tim re-created, although he hasn't been seen again).</p><p>They chat happily, and Bill remarks on how nice it was that Tim came back after only a week of being missing, in much better sorts than before. They are happily living with Holly, and not-so-happily with Cyril.</p><p>The conductor has arrived at the grave of Mary Elizabeth Hunter--Tim's mom. There, he eats a strawberry that grows from the vines that grow from Mary's grave. Gwendolyn, last seen when Tim left home before the <em>Rites of Passage</em> storyline, confronts him, and another woman who sits there eating the strawberries.</p><p>Tim, meanwhile, runs into Awn the Blink in the bowels of the house, who suddenly realizes that Tim is not really Tim, but a changeling, and Yo-yo is in fact the Wobbly. Using the Wobbly's powers to affect things that have been thrown away, they mold Awn anew, making him see the new Tim as his new master. Even the new Tim almost seems to believe he is the old Tim. Awn even promises to make Cyril like him.</p><p>Back at the cemetery, we see that the strawberries each contain an explicit, discrete memory of Mary's. When one eats the strawberry, one experiences what Mary experienced. (The strawberries are the result of the seeds Death gave Tim in issue 4). The old woman eats them because she is the mother of Jimmy, Tim's best childhood friend, who died back in issue 9 when he was transformed into a statue by Reverend Slaggingham (and who Tim tried to save in issues 23 and 25). She feels it is her right to eat the berries because they sometimes give her glimpses of Jimmy when he was alive, through Mary's memories.</p><p>Gwendolyn feels that the composer, however, has no right to eat them. He eats them to gain access to Mary's soulful experience of life, which is so much deeper than his own, in order to write music that is much better than he could otherwise--but in so doing, he robs Tim of the chance of ever experiencing those memories himself. Gwendolyn, instead, takes the berries and makes them into preserves, so that Tim may one day eat them.</p><p>The changeling Tim does seem happy to live his new life.

            "description": "<p> Now that Molly has left, Tim sits despondently--and angrily--on top of a large bridge.  He considers all those who have left his life.</p><p>A woman inexplicably climbs up the bridge.  She is worried about him.  Tim, however, is not in the mood to talk.  When she mentions she has a girlfriend, Tim makes their relationship disappear, out of spite.</p><p>Araquel sits in a park, relaxing.  However, an angel and a demon show up, and try to recruit him to their side in an upcoming war. He tangles them up and breaks their weapons, then walks away, as his daughter Nikki runs up to him.</p><p>Tim decides to give the woman her girlfriend back, then dumps her off the edge of the bridge, although she is apparently magically saved from injury.</p><p>Tim brings up magic scrying portals to see his house, which his father has apparently abandoned; he sees him having a good time with his new girlfriend and Cyril, forgetting all about Tim.  Tim's fury grows--just as the gargoyles in the last issue feared it would.</p><p>The angel and demon try to coax Nikki to tell them where she lives, in the hopes of using her against Araquel.  They mention that Khara was once a Chaldean dancer.  Araquel has had enough, and asks Nikki to close her eyes.  Then he decapitates the angel and the demon, and causes it to rain, washing the blood off Nikki.</p><p>Tim watches the people below, and sees Molly's face on many of the girls. His anger reaches a bursting point, and he destroys the carnival below him, as well as the bridge.  He walks among the wreckage and the dead and wounded.  He feels good.  Khara shows up and can't believe what she heard.  He explains that none of this is real, he just created the place and people to let off some steam. However she points out that if he can ignore the humanity of these creations, it makes it all the easier to ignore the humanity of real people next time.</p><p>She says that Molly was right--he is completely self-absorbed, and had lost touch with reality.</p><p>We zoom back out to reality, and see that they are really on a beach, where Tim built some sand castles that functioned as the dreamscape he was in a moment ago.</p><p>Araquel goes home and writes a note to Khara. He leaves it with Nikki, and tells her not to let anyone in, then flies off.</p><p>Khara notices Tim's remaining tattoo, the moth. She is angry that he got it without realizing what it does--it keeps him alone and unconnected, like a fluttering moth that never lights anywhere.  This is what led to his estrangement with Molly--it was intended to protect her from him, and it did so by taking her out of his life.</p><p>Khara pulls out the Stone of Opening and gives it back to Tim, saying it could help remove the tattoo.  As he holds it, it gives him true visions of his home, where his dad is fixing it up in hope he comes back.  He sees Molly, who is happy, even if she also misses him.  Tim's awakening to the truth of his relationships sets him free, and the tattoo leaves.</p><p>Khara comes him, and reads Araquel's note.  He has left, presumably because he didn't want Khara and Nikki to have to deal with the pressures of these angels and demons.  But, Khara is worried, what will he do now that his only link to humanity is gone?</p>",

            "description": "<p> Molly and Tim have now been staying with Zatanna in San Francisco for a month.  Zatanna is supposed to be teaching Tim about magic, although their lessons haven't really started.</p><p>Instead, Molly has become quite unhappy. She gets up in the morning to call her father and says that she wants to go home.</p><p>This issue is narrated by Jack Hammer, a gargoyle.  He is part of a gargoyle society which surveils people and learns their secrets.  They can hide in plain sight by pretending to be normal architectural gargoyles. Jack speaks in a classic film noir style.</p><p>Zatanna wakes Tim up. She stuns him with a magic trick where she seems able to make the sun rise when she raises a crystal in the air. He desperately wants to learn magic like her.</p><p>They all have breakfast.  Molly doesn't eat anything, but Tim doesn't notice. Tim keeps asking about how Zatanna did it.  Molly can't believe he's so oblivious--she just knew what time the sun was going to rise, and was wearing a watch to know when to raise the crystal.  Zatanna explains that magic is a lot about observation and misdirection. Molly is clearly unhappy about Tim, but he doesn't notice.</p><p>Another gargoyle comes up and sees that Jack is still watching.  This is a break in their ways, they are not supposed to get involved in the people they watch.  However, Jack knows that Tim is an Opener, and Molly is his Other (as was mentioned once a while ago), so if Molly leaves, the notably unbalanced and self-obsessed Tim may sink all of California in his anger.</p><p>The other gargoyle reports back to his group. They all become very frightened at the news, and all fly off to learn what they can from the human pair.</p><p>Zatanna explains more about misdirection, then gives Molly a packet, without explaining why. She asks if the kids would go up and give the rabbits some exercise on the roof, clearly wanting them to talk.</p><p>Jack continues to notice how Tim is not really paying attention to Molly any more. He finally decides to act, completely breaking the gargoyle code. He tells the two kids that he is a guardian of secrets. He tells Molly about how Tim and Leah went camping out west, and how Leah tried to seduce Tim by making herself look like Molly.  He says that Tim and Leah made out for a while, then Tim pushed her away--but then he ended up kissing her again, even after he knew who she was. Tim admits that it's true.</p><p>He counters that Molly was similarly somewhat smitten by Taik in the realm of Faerie, but Molly and Jack point out that Molly told Tim about that.</p><p>As fair play, he then tells Tim about Molly's secret--that she's leaving, because he only cares about magic now, and ignores her.  He didn't originally notice that she had to float now, and still didn't realize that she couldn't eat any more, because of her fairy curse.</p><p>Tim is desperate, he feels like she didn't tell him that she was this angry, and didn't realize she was hurt, and is willing to listen now. But Molly is done with it. She takes Zatanna's packet and uses it to teleport home.</p><p>Tim is angry at Molly and at Zatanna. Jack tells him that he should be happy--that people become gargoyles like him when they keep too many secrets.</p>",

They are driving through very rural Wyoming.</p><p>The town they are nearing, Spartanville, also known by some of its inhabitants as New Sparta, was at least partly taken over by a religious cult leader, Absalom Smith, about 14 years previously.  Now the town is deserted and run down, and everyone lives in a bunker/fort outside town.</p><p>The comic is partly narrated by the Tasha Ross, originally the town librarian, who ran afoul of Smith.  Her diaries from the time he took over, and later, give context to the current storyline.</p><p>Smith ruled that all children that were not his--and he has impregnated most of the town's women--were sacrilegious, and must be abandoned at the rest stop outside the town limits.</p><p>A whole group of those children, now of various ages up through teens, now lives in hiding in the rest stop.  Originally they were cared for by Tasha Ross, who was blackmailed by Smith, who otherwise threatened to kill another child she cared for.</p><p>The children are basically wild. They are named after the candy in the snack machine, which is all the food they have to eat.</p><p>The townsfolk drop off a new baby in the rest stop, which starts a chain reaction among the children, who are tiring of their life and roles.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zatanna is concerned that neither Molly nor Tim's parents know where they are.  She insists they talk with them so she is not illegally harboring them.  Both children are unhappy with their parents or grandparents, so they are not looking forward to this.</p><p>One of the children who found the new baby also found a knife.  One girl, Caramel, who has been good at keeping the others motivated, accidentally causes another, Chip, to get angry.  He takes the knife, and there is a fight.</p><p>When Zatanna and the kids stop at the rest stop, they find the new baby on the ground, alone, covered in blood.  Zatanna is angry, and casts a healing spell, but they realize the baby was actually unharmed.  Instead, it heals Caramel, who was nearby and trying to protect it, but had been hurt by Chip.</p><p>She is thankful for the help, but she soon disappears, intent on keeping the children's location hidden from outsiders.</p><p>Tim, angry at Zatanna for what he sees as her hypocrisy regarding parenting, walks off, letting the kids alone.  Instead he picks up the bloody knife and magically \"cleans\" it, putting the blood \"where it belonged.\"</p><p>Chip, who had run off, finds himself wounded in town, where the cult's members shoot him.</p><p>Smith, watching from his bunker, finds that his hands are bloody--presumably due to Tim's spell.</p><p> </p>",

She runs up, reminded of her uncle Donal's suicide, but finds out that he's fine.  They bond over their misfortune--he over his immortal but decrepit body, her over the fact that since she ate fairy food when she was in faerie, she can't eat Earth food, and can now only float above the ground instead of touching it--a fact that Tim didn't notice. She misses the ability to walk in the grass with bare feet. The mere fact that he didn't makes her feel like he isn't truly paying attention to her.  Tanarak, however, does notice.</p><p>Zatanna and Tara see Molly and Tanarak, and Tara realizes what has happened to Tanarak.  She makes to leave, hating what has happened to him, but Zatanna keeps her from leaving.  Tara goes up to talk with Tanarak.</p><p>Tim introduces Molly and Zatanna, and the three of them go out to watch the evil immortal couple walk off with their bare feet in the grass.</p>",

The girl recognizes her as a Faerie, and is scared.</p><p>Huon tells Tim that he has not destroyed Faerie, merely turned it inchoate, so that it may take a new shape, as its still-living inhabitants wish.</p><p>Auberon comes upon a figure in the form of Gwendolyn, who reproaches him for his cowardice in the face of the Teind, as well as in his relationship with Titania.</p><p>Huon explains that Lucifer created Hell out of an empty space, as he wished it to be, just as Faerie is now to be created by wishes.</p><p>Molly comes upon another version of herself, who berates her for letting herself fall for Taik, and for letting her anger get the better of her. She wants her to trust herself again.</p><p>Taik's true soul comes upon the spirit who had taken over his body in the fog, naming him Abaddon, one of the powerful demons of Hell.  He had slowly wormed his way into Taik's once-pure soul, who did in truth love Molly.  The two selves fight, and Abaddon kills Taik, but is himself then stomped to death by his horse.</p><p>Yarrow meets herself as well, and decides she must follow Molly's example, and be herself no matter what.

Tim, however, says we find ourselves by being with other people, and decides that its time for him to be an Opener: he will open all to the world.</p><p>However, Huon says that Yarrow has born the world without him: she is the Leveller.  He sends Tim home.  Huon says that Faerie no longer has to pay the Teind, and that Taik has been returned in the shape of a horse, but without his demon-parasite.</p><p>Yarrow tells all the fairies that Molly's example is what saved them, and recreated their realm.  Titania can't fix Molly, since she ate fairy food, but she says she can go home and walk above the earth, and eat from a bag of fairy food, and thus survive.

One day, a being came to their eight rulers, and said he would help.  He took them to a new land, Faerie, but Huon (one of the leaders) thought he sensed something terrible underneath its seeming.</p><p>The being revealed himself to be Lucifer, and said that they could have the land if they would send seven of themselves to his land every seven years.  The eight lords agreed, with Huon being less sure.  Lucifer then took the other seven lords away to Hell.</p><p>Huon became the first kind of Faerie, but his guilt literally consumed him and Faerie forgot about him.

The lead actress, who used to live there and experienced the magical sensations there, feels uncomfortable making a movie there now, with all its fakery.</p><p>Tim and Leah talk with the now-healthy mermaid bathing in their car, which is full of water from the rain created by their kiss.  The mermaid doesn't understand why they can't control their magic and their reliance on words, while they are not sure they can trust her, as an elemental.  She is from a Tower, but at least not the Dark Tower. The mermaid splashes them, and they all disappear from the real world, and Tim and the mermaid reappear in her tower of the Moon, a vast unending space of water.</p><p>The mermaid continues to talk to him cryptically about how words are empty, then swims away, testing his understanding.  He realizes that he needs true understanding of the being behind words, like the name \"Leah.\" A swarm of naked water spirits come out of the moon and swirl around him, teasing him for his half-boy, half-adult state, his continuing embarrassment over sexuality and nudity, his fear of \"swimming with\" Leah, and the fact that he \"has never felt the tide.\"  However, one remonstrates the rest, saying that perhaps Tim is waiting for his \"Other,\" a term the original mermaid also used. But then she looks deeper into him, and says it was just his fear, after all.  The water spirits leave, and Tim is unmanned.</p><p>The actress tries to keep working on the movie, but just isn't satisfied with its artistry and meaning.  A powerful rain starts to fall.</p><p>Outside the Tower of the Moon, Leah watches Tim's travails and yells at the mermaid for torturing him.  The mermaid says the spirits were just part of Tim's self, and that this is necessary for him to grow up.  She says she is the last Keeper of the Tide, and is alone in the Tower, dying.  The kids in the area used to keep her alive with their imaginations, but now the movie keeps them away.  Only Leah's dreams of her love for Tim are keeping the mermaid alive now.</p><p>A Storm of Chaos starts to rain down inside the Tower.  The Keeper dies, but makes a chalice and tells Leah she must drink it, to become the new Keeper and save Tim.</p><p>The actress, escaping the rain, finds Tim's body in a cave, and tries to help him. However, the rain seems to turn to demons, and the film crew runs.  The director, who was frustrated by the actress's romantic ideals, finds the movie's fantasy props, now turned truly magical, and seeks out the actress.</p>",

Now she just starves herself.</p><p>Tim is acting nervous around Leah, but it's more because he's attracted to Leah than being scared of her. Leah goes to sleep in the tent. Tim, after being conflicted, sleeps outside.</p><p>Leah has her own conflicts, and succumbs to them.  She changes form to look like Molly, and makes out with Tim.</p><p>Molly, now that she's eaten Faerie food, is converting to being a mybrid human/Faerie, partially due to her often-referenced innately fey nature.  Her clothes, and the ground, burn at her touch.</p><p>She decides to visit the castle to talk with Titania, and manages to use magic to convince a bridge and a door to let her enter.  She burns the axe of a guard and brazenly marches into the court, confronting Titania.  The other guests leave in a hurry.</p><p>Molly, now surrounded in flames, tells Titania off, explaining how her trick feels like murder, or rape, stealing away her future and her family, and Tim.  Titania is shamed, and tries to show her sympathy, but Molly is ticked off, and flares up at her touch.</p><p>Tim, after some minutes of exuberant groping, realizes that it's Leah, not Molly.  He's angry at her trick, but also feels true attraction to Leah anyway.  Leah is touched and tells how she started off as an angel, before being damned by joining Lucifer.  Since then, Tim is the only person who cared about her.</p><p>They kiss again, and their conjoining brings down a magical rain, created by Tim as an Opener, which starts the desert to flowering.  The mermaid is now cured, and sits in their convertible, now full of life's water.</p>",

Creative work like this is not natural in Faerie.  Molly, however, is mostly interested in growing herself some food (from real-world seeds). Yarrow in particular is amazed at Molly's ability to sing and be cheerful as she works.</p><p>Tim and Leah visit Zatanna, to ask her to help mentor Tim, but she's not at home.</p><p>Two kids try to get in a protected area of the Mojave desert known as Little Moon, which is currently being used as a set for a film.  They've come there in the past, before the film company fenced it off, due to its local reputation as a magical place. However, the guards run them off.</p><p>Suddenly a whirlwind with a human figure inside knocks down the fence and rushes into the center of the space.</p><p>Tim and Leah decide to go camping in the desert, with the city-bred British Tim feeling uncomfortable in the wild--and with the fact that they only have one tent, which means sharing it with succubus Leah.  They hear a sound, and find an unconscious mermaid lying on the ground, tangled up in the remains of the fence.</p><p>Yarrow tries her hand at gardening, but isn't succeeding.  Titania comes by, and puts a Faerie seed in Molly's garden, and threatens Yarrow if she tells. Titania is angry with Molly for taking her subjects' attention away.  Titania magically advances time, and the garden grows.</p><p>Leah and Tim can't figure out why there's a mermaid in the desert, and can't move her--her body is like water.  Leah moves their camp near her, as Tim is entranced by the topless mermaid's assets, leading Leah to realize that Tim hasn't slept with Molly yet.</p><p>Despite their attempts, the mermaid is dying, although she does wake up.</p><p>Molly wakes up and talks with the horse she freed last issue, which she calls Prince. She is amazed at how the garden grew, and eats a Faerie berry, realizing as soon as she does that she's trapped in Faerie forever.</p>",

For instance, a groom says his horse has been cursed so his mane and tail will always be tangled, and he will always limp, but it's really because he has a stone in his hoof and he doesn't brush him.</p><p>Leah just pops the stone out of his hoof.  But, she takes a special interest in him because she can tell he hasn't always been a horse.</p><p>Tim is ready to leave the modeling agency, but Psyche, who has taken to her new gangsta role more seriously than Cupid, pulls a real gun on Leah.

He's been caring for Tim for a while.  Kenny watches as Tim sleeps, and his tattoos transform into living animals and attack each other.  Kenny wakes Tim up, and the tattoos (which Kenny calls maps) continue to battle.</p><p>The scorpion tries to sting the butterfly but hits the lit candle and burns up.  The butterfly comes back and Tim slaps it into a new, smaller location on his arm.  Kenny admonishes Tim for letting Circe put them on him in the first place, but also says Tim is not ready to let go of the butterfly.</p><p>Kenny then tells Tim he can take any one thing from his knapsack, which turns out to have tickets to locations all over the world.</p><p>Tim decides to go to San Francisco to see Zatanna.  Arriving in the airport, he is already amazed at American customs and sights when he runs into Leah, the succubus he freed (last seen in issue 8).  She's now a teen model, touring around with a van full of other teen models.</p><p>She gets Tim to jump in, and they all ride off.  Leah is not unhappy to hear that Tim isn't seeing Molly any more.</p><p> </p>",

He carries the miniature statue of his friend Jimmy, who was turned into that state by Reverend Slaggingham in issue 9.</p><p>Tim remembers when he and Jimmy were at the beach as kids.  His dad tells them a story about how all the pier workers are really cannibal pirates in disguise, which they almost believe until his aunt tells him it's not.</p><p>Tim misses being a carefree kid, his life now having been changed by both his mother's death and the world of magic.</p><p>In the flashback, kid-Tim pulls an ankh out of a pincer-toy machine.  They meet a strange old fisher man, J. Alfred Skinner, who says he'll trade them an all-day pass to the rides on the pier for the ankh.  He wants to use it as a lure on his fishing rod, to catch a muddle-mullah, a strange creature of the deep.</p><p>The kids think he's one of the pirates, but they give him the ankh and take the passes.</p><p>In the present, Tim laments that his new tattoos won't let him use his own magic to fix Jimmy.  He considers asking John Constantine to do it, and maybe he'll be able to stay with him, too.  Unseen by Tim, Skinner is watching him.</p><p>In the past, Tim and Jimmy are on the Ferris Wheel when it gets stuck in place.  They're worried, but also enjoy just imagining about other lands while they're stuck.</p><p>Tim, wandering around feeling sorry for himself, sees Death (wearing the ankh) and Skinner. Skinner's seemingly dead body still stands by the side of the pier, fishing for the muddle-mullah, while his spirit talks with Death about his fishing attempts.  The muddle-mullah took part of his finger, and his soul, as a child.</p><p>Death volunteers Tim to help with Skinner's problem.  She also asks for Jimmy, who is dead, not just transformed.  Tim gives up Jimmy and goes to find the muddle-mullah, who turns out to be a normal crab.  He gives it to Skinner.</p><p>Death asks Tim if he wants to go get some pancakes.</p>",

They have a special relationship, as her gran shares her occasional magical sense of the world. Gran gives her a letter about Tim, which felt dangerous to her, and she asks Molly to read it on top of a reputedly magical hill.</p><p>Molly agrees and rides off. When they get there, the horse starts to eat the letter. Although it's torn, she manages to read most of it. It's from Gwendolyn, and relates the after-effects of the previous issue: Tim returned home and got into a row wth his dad about Cyril. Gwen tried to convince him to stay home, but he left in secret in the morning, leaving a note asking her to relate his love to Molly. Gwen also plans to leave. Molly realizes that Tim heard what she said about him and his future self when she was with Marya.</p><p>Molly resolves to find Tim and patch up their problems. Knowing the magic of the hill, she hopes to get the aid of the local fairies in finding Tim. However, the Amadan was already watching her, and flies down. She recognizes him from when she met Auberon, and he introduces himself as a fool. She laughs, at which he is angered, but she says she is the greater fool. He challenges her to a contest of who is the greater fool, and will grant her her desire if she wins. The other giant rocks on the hill are proof of what happens to losers. The Amadan flies off to prepare, and one of the stones gives her advice as she waits: follow her heart while in faerie.</p><p>(Gwendolyn [\"Sister Staylace\"] only appears through her writing in the note.)</p>",

A car almost hits him, and he magically puts it in a hole as a response.  His scorpion tattoo stabs him painfully in return, as it is supposed to keep him from practicing ill-advised magic.</p><p>At home, Bill and his new lady-friend, Holly, her son Cyril, and their housekeeper Gwendolyn are trying to get the house ready for Tim's 14th birthday.</p><p>The occupants of the car are now stuck inside, and as they try to get out, they are visited by the man's son, and two mysterious people in black, known as the Margraves.  It turns out that the couple in the care are actually having an affair.  The boy is understandably unhappy with his father, and under the Margraves' supervision, he magically explodes the car and the couple inside.  The explosion also destroys him, but he recreates himself.  He is one of a series of children called the Strafenkind that are manipulated by the Margraves.</p><p>Tim gets some fabric for Gwendolyn, but while at the store, he sees a miniature statue version of his friend Jimmy, last seen in issue 9 when he was turned into gutta-percha by Reverend Slaggingham.  Tim buys him and as he walks away wondering who did it, the wall (another of Tim's childhood creations, known as In the No!) tells him it was Slaggingham. It then tells him that Cyril is eating his cake, and Tim doesn't even know who he is, and that Gwendolyn is leaving.</p><p>Cyril, meanwhile, has finished the cake and runs off, no longer happy with his mom now that she's fascinated with Bill.  He runs into the Margraves, who tell him how right he is to be angry at Tim, saying that he is too amazing to be true.  Then they give him one of their magic pins, and tell him to go home and explode in his mother's presence.</p><p>Tim shows up, however, and releases Cyril from their spell, and reveals that the two Margraves are in fact one combined being.  Tim thanks them for helping him realize that he can't stay around his family and friends, where he'll always endanger them.  The Margrave leaves, and Tim walks off, with Jimmy in his pocket.</p>",

Gwendolyn, upstairs, is also happy to be of help to the family.</p><p>Circe brings Tim, in cat form, back to her tattoo parlor, and un-charms his mind so he can think again.  She tells him some of the mistakes he made when he took cat form, making it too easy for him to lose his mind to the cat's natural thoughts.</p><p>Then she realizes that he didn't just borrow a cat's body, he reshaped his own body into a cat's, which is is such an impressive piece of magic that she is now scared of him.  She intended to use her magic to read his soul and then transform him.  Now she needs to be more direct.</p><p>Holly Ransome, who helped bring Bill back from the hospital some time ago, shows up at his doorstep to ask him out.  When Gwendolyn answers the door, she is taken aback, thinking she's Bill's wife.  But Gwen, realizing Holly's interest, explains the situation and asks her in.</p><p>Circe thinks Tim may be a servant of an evil group like the Dark Tower or the Margrave, who are introduced later. She can't believe he fooled Molly, who seemed so sharp. She uses magical tools to pull out his self, and is surprised to see that he seems to be good. The more she magically cuts him open, the more good she reveals inside of him, until she is humbled by his purity.</p><p>Bill gets home from his jog, and quickly hits it off with Holly.  He asks about her boy, Cyril, who's not there.</p><p>Tim wakes up, once again in boy form, and angry at being charmed and put in a cage.  Circe apologizes. She tells him that she knows he heard what Molly said--that he could grow up to hurt her.  Circe had planned to use her magic to find his soul's animal spirit-form, and have him confront what evil it may have represented, thus saving Molly.  But, she found that he has no animal spirit form, he's the most human soul she has ever seen.

Molly is grounded, and Tim is angry at what magic has done to his life.</p><p>He sees a cat, Filthy, and thinks it has a much simpler, happier life than he does.</p><p>A man sees Circe on the street, and thinks she's a prostitute. Annoyed, she invites him into her tattoo parlour, and he disappears.</p><p>Tim turns himself into a cat--a giant one at first, then normal cat size--and right away starts having trouble mixing his thoughts with the natural, simplified thoughts of a cat. He has enough focus to climb up to Molly's room, but she's gone, climbed out on a rope.</p><p>Molly is meeting with Marya, who's there with her unicorn. Molly conveys to her what Sir Timothy, as the dragon, told her in Hell--that he had sold his memories to demons, and that Tim might grow up to do the same, unless Molly got him to promise not to do so. Tim promised, but Molly didn't tell him why, and she's not sure whether to tell him. She's torn, because she loves Tim, but fears what he might become now. Then Circe shows up.</p><p>Tim, continuing to have trouble remembering he's a boy, keeps his mind on Molly enough to try to hunt her down by scent, with some newly-grown bat wings to help.</p><p>The still soot-covered Daniel hides on a roof, talking to the barely-working skull of Reverend Slaggingham. He saw Hamlet recently, and it makes him think about the difficulties in his life, and how he misses Marya.</p><p>Circe introduces herself and asks Molly for information about Tim. She says men are all the same, and seems to know about him. She offers to help the girls, as a proverbial sister.</p><p>As Circe does some magic, Daniel sees it, and starts to fly over.</p><p>Tim, as the cat, finds the ladies talking about him. Molly explains what she said before, and that she doesn't want to leave him. Marya says that she may not want to leave him because that might be what makes him turn to evil in the first place, like happened with her and Daniel. Unfortunately, Daniel shows up right when she says that.</p><p>Circe, meanwhile, sees Tim, and magically locks him into his cat form, and puts him in a cage. Then she blasts Daniel, who had been trying, however clumsily, to apologize. Her blast turns him into a whimpering dog, which she explains is the form of his soul.</p><p>While Molly sees this as cruel, Marya is completely taken with Daniel the dog, and cuddles him. She tells Circe to stay away from Tim, and Circe leaves with him in a cage, Molly not knowing that it's him in there.</p><p> </p>",

Drawn into a book of twisted fairy tales, Tim, Molly and Mr. Wrong must play the roles Barbatos has written for them if they're to reach the end of their ordeal alive. </i></p><p>Tim, Molly, Sir Timothy (in the shape of a dragon), and Barbatos are in another of the strange storybooks that Molly and Tim were forced to read earlier.  Barbatos is attempting to control the storyline.</p><p>Tim finds himself lost in a forest, and temporarily turns into a knight.  He knows he is being manipulated by Barbatos, especially when a transparently fake owl, meant to look like his late familiar, Yo-yo, shows up.  Tim plays along but the owl steals his glasses.</p><p>Sir Timothy the Dragon and Molly are stuck in a weird metal cave with a hoard of treasure.  Sir Timothy is happy to be with Molly, but she (not knowing his identity) does not feel the same.  Finally he persuades her to dress up like a princess, and explains that he had been growing Mollys for years.  When she puts on the dress, her personality transforms into a haughty princess as well, and she starts being dismissive of the dragon.</p><p>Tim finds the cliff they're on, and at first seems to see Molly being threatened by the dragon.  However, Tim easily realizes that they are just more of Barbatos's puppets, and magically creates a giant metal knight to knock them aside and go after the demon.</p><p>He finally catches Barbatos, but realizes that Molly is now trapped under the collapsed mountain.  Only Sir Timothy holds up the ceiling protecting her.  Molly snaps out of it when the dragon finally tells her his true identity: a future Tim Hunter, who has lived a life he is not proud of.  He makes Molly promise to take steps to make sure young Tim doesn't turn out like him.</p><p>Outside, young Tim doesn't know how to get Molly out, but then his adult self blows a hole in the scrap with his dragon breath. Molly escapes, but Sir Timothy dies due to the effort, and Molly feels sad for him as he does.  Molly fulfills her promise to the dragon, and makes young Tim swear by his name to never deal with demons--which is how Sir Timothy started down his dark path.  She doesn't, however, tell him who the dragon was.</p><p>She and Tim leave the story, with Barbatos still stuck there.</p>",

Tim, Tanger and Happy the Golem must navigate Hell's playground to rescue Molly...and discover in the process that demons never play fair. </i></p><p>Tim, Tanger, and Happy, having arrived in Hell, which strangely looks like a mix between a mall and an airport, now must figure out how to find Molly and Crimple.  Tanger is surprisingly not dying, now that he's away from his home tree, but is instead sprouting new growths while sitting on Happy.</p><p>Sir Timothy, now that he has been awakened to his previous bondage to Barbatos, walks the streets of the future and even gives a cart of cash to a homeless man due to his love of the man's musical work.  Timothy goes to the Chinese restaurant that recently offered him a job.  He tells the owner, who knows who Timothy really is, that he'd like to buy a box to bury Barbatos in.  However, the owner notes that Timothy is too saddled with self-centeredness and that he would perhaps be happier as a dragon.  At that, the owner himself turns into a dragon.</p><p>While young Tim is recognized as a living boy in Hell, he manages to avoid capture.</p><p>Araquel the fallen angel does Barbatos's bidding, and tries to make sure that Tim's friends and allies don't come rescue him in hell.  However, he realizes that they were all busy anyway, and that Barbatos really wanted him to be too busy to find Nikki and Khara.</p><p>Vuall the demon governess forces Molly to read morality stories intended to make her agreeable and submissive, by torturing Crimple if she does not comply. In particular, she reads the story of Shrinking Violetta, who meets \"No One,\" who punishes her for being independent.</p><p>Tim, now in the woods of hell, meets someone named No One.</p>",

Tim and Titania have an unlikely reunion as the question of Tim Hunter's true parentage is settled once and for all. </i></p><p>Salamander is reduced to trying to sell magic items on the street after the destruction of Slaggingham's sewer base.  Titania and the Amadan, in London, pass by him with condescension.</p><p>Tim and Molly finally get to have some ice cream, and are observed by Circe, a tattoo artist.</p><p>Staylace--now going by her first name, Gwendolyn--runs into Tim and Molly, and introduces them to Auberon, who still hasn't put his soul back in his body.  A mental construct of Gwendolyn teaches Auberon's soul about being responsible within the globe.</p><p>Marya (protected by the unicorn) and Daniel argue; he feels she ran out on him, but she just wanted to grow up in the real world. The unicorn stabs Daniel after he slaps Marya. Daniels leaves.</p><p>Gwen wants Tim to help Auberon, but Tim gets worried once he realizes that he's Titania's husband. He tries, but can't figure out how to do it.  Then Titania shows up.  She is angry at having to deal with the humans, and at the mess Auberon has gotten himself into. She tries to get the globe from Tim, but it falls and breaks.  Titania is about to wreak terror on them all in revenge for his presumably-lost soul, but it turns out that it went back into his body after all.</p><p>Auberon feels that he has learned something from being among the mortals, and stops Titania.  He wants to start a new relationship with her, after only playing at love for centuries.  He also asks Tim and Titania if Tim is her son, and she admits that it is true, and that Tamlin is the father.</p><p>However, Auberon says that Tim has no fairy blood, and so cannot be Titania's son, although he does look like Tamlin.  Auberon and Titania leave, with Tim once more unsure of his parentage. (This is wrapped up much later in the Books of Faerie, where it turns out that Titania was actually originally human as well, and so it is true that she is his mother, and that Tim's parents are both human.)</p>",

He blasts them with gutta-percha and turns them into statues.</p><p>Daniel looks for Marya in London for days but no longer knows his way around. He starts to hate everyone. He misses the grifters he grew up with in Victorian England, and goes down into the sewers.</p><p>Tim and Molly stop off at her dance studio so she can pick something up. The now-somewhat-grown Marya is there, dancing. She says she’ll come with Molly, and when she comes out, she and Tim recognize each other from the Children’s Crusade. Marya blurts out that Tim is Molly’s boyfriend, which Tim didn’t know, and also tells Molly that he’s a magician. He runs off, ranting about the craziness of life. They run smiling after him, but he lets his power go off by accident and freezes time all around him. However, Khara and Nikki show up.</p><p>Daniel gets lost in the sewers, but Sister Staylace finds him, and brings him to Slaggingham’s sewer base of operations, where he is planning against the surface world. It turns out that Daniel knew Slaggingham when Daniel originally lived in London, and Slaggingham’s has lived there all this time. Daniel joins him.</p>",

Tim Hunter must confront his evil future self, then decide whether he's willing to commit murder in order to save his father's life. In the process, Tim displays his first major act of mystical prowess. </i></p><p>Sir Timothy browbeats Martyn, who has shrunk to miniature size, and destroys his magical items. Since Sir Timothy no longer has his memories of his childhood, he doesn't whether Martyn can help or hurt the young Tim into growing up to be Sir Timothy. He asks Barbatos, who is more interested in eating junk food, and who is clearly actually the one calling the shots. Barbatos tells Sir Timothy that Martyn isn't the man to help. </p><p>We next see Tim in Marlyn's house, where Leah ended up leading him. They kissed earlier, Tim's first. He is (not literally) entranced by her. He goes to see Martyn, but the golem outside grabs him to keep him out. Tim uses his magic to redraw the golem's clay face, and renames him Happy; he is now under Tim's control. </p><p>Leah sees it happen, and is amazed; she says such a thing is impossible. She checks in on Martyn for Tim, and sees that he's dead. She's very happy--and free. </p><p>She tells Tim they're going to the hospital. While he changes, she frees the rest of her birds. However, while she is free of Martyn, she is still magically chained to her box.</p><p>She gets his car, and pulls up outside Tim’s house. She asks him to get her box. She decides she likes Tim for real, and wants him to be her new master. She tells him she’s a succubus, and that Martyn is dead. She burns Martyn’s house and they drive off to the hospital. She tells Tim he can heal his dad if he sacrifices a cat, but Tim can’t do it. He tries to use his own magic to heal him, but can’t bring himself to do it: the love isn’t there. As he says, “cats enjoy life. Dad didn’t.”</p><p>As her new master, Tim tells Leah that she is her own master now, and she is truly free. Tim takes the cat home.</p><p>Sir Timothy and Barbatos are back in the future. The demon has an even tighter grip on Sir Timothy, and can even make him enjoy living in a box on the street.</p>",

They are taught by Vuall.  However, unlike the real Molly, these Mollies all have their will sucked out.  Sir Timothy treats them all very badly.  Sir Timothy considers the state of affairs, in which he is one of the leaders of Earth, having used his magic to treat with demons.  However, he has a sudden dizziness, and seems to switch from his mansion to a shack.  He thinks the demon Barbatos can help him.</p><p>Araquel, a fallen angel, is chained above the pit of hell.  His ex-wife Khara and his daughter, Nikki, visit him.  Khara tells him he should free himself to be with them, but he thinks he can't.  She tells him she's going to London to stop someone (Tim) from making a mistake and ruining the world.</p><p>Young Tim, returned to London from Death and Faerie, runs into Molly outside.  (This is her first appearance in real time.)  They're friends, and Molly clearly likes Time, who's oblivious.  She asks him about California, where everyone thought he went when he was in Faerie. Tim suddenly realizes that today is the anniversary of his mother's death.  His dad usually drinks himself into a stupor on this day.  He wonders if he really cares any more, now that he knows that Bill isn't his real dad, and his dead mom, Mary, wasn't his real mom, but then he goes and visits her grave anyway.</p><p>Sir Timothy goes to find Barbatos, to ask why the world seems to be changing around him.  He thinks Barbatos is his slave demon, but really he's under Barbatos's control.  Barbatos says that their continuity is in danger because there are less of the young Tims who are likely to turn into the current Sir Timothy--in fact, there is only one Tim left who might turn into Sir Timothy.  If Sir Timothy wants to keep his own timeline stable, he'll have to travel back into the past with Barbatos to fix it.</p><p>Tim opens the envelope he got from Death, which is full of seeds.  He pours them on his mother's grave.</p><p>Sir Timothy, now in 1994, watches young Tim leave the cemetery.  He remembers how he slowly lost his memories of his life, trading them to demons for power and money. He begins to wonder if it was all worth it.</p><p>Khara and Nikki take a portrait of Mary from Bill while he sits in the car she died in.  They ambush Sir Timothy and throw him the portrait, which is so karmically heavy that it pins him to the ground. Khara warns Sir Timothy to say away from young Tim.</p><p>Sir Timothy manages to get away, and returns to his own time, looking for his current Molly, only to see that his mansion is again a shack.</p>",

            "description": "<p>The combined might of The Authority and StormWatch Prime have breached the defenses of Henry Bendix's bunker...and what they find is mind-boggling! What secrets does this remote location hold - and could this be where Apollo and Midnighter were 'born'?</p><p>After beating Bendix's team of clones, The Authority and Stormwatch make their way into Henry Bendix's secret bunker. Hawksmoor and King talk about their teams not trusting each other with whatever they may find there, whether it be an immense benefit to the world or its greatest threat. They walk further and find large tubes filled with the bodies of various SPBs, more of Bendix's experiments. In the center of one room they find an energy source. Winter identifies it as one that runs off ambient cosmic energy, something that could have possibly given the world free energy in Bendix hadn't been so intent on making weapons.</p><p>After looking some more, they realize that Bendix was running his own little human genome project, mapping human genes so he could find the best way to add superhuman abilities. The main purpose of the bunker was to make SPBs. Midnighter brings up that it's probably where he and Apollo were made. Apollo tells him to stop, saying that even if Bendix gave them their powers he didn't <em>make</em> them, they had to come from somewhere else. Jackson King agrees with Apollo, saying that he had probably been kidnapped, or an uninformed volunteer. Just then, Fahrenheit finds an old comic with a woman dressed in black on the cover. Her name is Midnighter Rider. King says that she was an old hero from the 40's and Fahrenheit points out the resemblance to Midnighter.</p><p>Midnighter begins to think that maybe he was made from Midnight Rider. Apollo tries to talk him out of that line of thought and then starts saying that it doesn't matter where he came from, just what he is now. Midnighter can't handle that though, he wants to know where he comes from. He's comfortable with who he is now, but he still wants to know about his past life. Apollo starts to think about it when Bendix appears again. He starts spouting off possible origins of Midnighter, saying he could be an army recruit, a man with a bad childhood, a mixture of stolen SPB genes, any number of things. He claims that any of those could be true, he just doesn't remember which one was Midnighter's history since he never bothered to take note of where his victims came from. This provokes Midnighter into attacking and Apollo threatens to burn the whole place to the ground. Jackson talks him out of it, saying that there could be things in the bunker capable of benefiting the world.</p><p>Just then, Winter tells the others that the power source isn't what it had first seemed. It isn't powering the building, just something below it. Fuji rips open the floor and reveals Bendix's body in a tube. Angie chimes in with some information she had found. Bendix had cloned himself a younger body since his older one couldn't be given super human abilities. When the new one woke up, it would be an SPB. Apollo is ready to incinerate it when Rose Tattoo appears. Before they can react, she opens fire paralyzing Fuji with her first attack. Jackson gets anyone who isn't bulletproof away and tries to get Jack to kill her. He won't because she's his friend and they try to find other ways. After she cuts Apollo Midnighter says they may have to kill her. The Doctor and Jenny are still busy and can't fix whatever Bendix did to her so Midnighter closes in. He puts her in a choke hold and when she continues to attack even when he gives her a chance, he prepares to kill her, but right then a new Bendix appears...</p>",

She explains how she now acts as a transmitter as all machines no longer work and birds flock to her due to destroyed or rearranged magnetic fields. As she flies over the ruined city she sees a lone balloon floating up in the air. She heads toward it finding Midnighter guiding a group of refugees. The group stops as both Midnighter and Swift talk. Soon Midnighter becomes panicked and tells everyone to go. Swift tries to get everyone to move the two disabled trains behind them are destroyed and Midnighter grabs a sharp piece of metal prepared to fight telling them not to look back. Soon to hulkish creatures charge at the group. Swift calls them Incubites. She says they are a result of a mutating disease called Warhol Fever. It gives the infected large muscular bodies and fills them with rage and anger, but it is only short lived as the disease soon kills the infected and that even Midnighter cannot survive contact with the virus. He throws the piece of metal through one of their mouths as the group runs and Swift soon takes for the sky trying to get <i>specialist </i>help. Midnighter then grabs a chunk of the railroad and stabs another through the chest as Swift struggles to fly through the poisonous cloud covering the planet. Soon as Midnighter prepares to fight a large group of Incubites a bright blast of light shines killing the Incubites. Soon a shining Apollo appears. He explains that Swift came to get him for help and soon his face is revealed to now look sickly and withered. Midnighter mentions he has been living in the photosphere. Swift explains it is the only place where he can absorb needed sunlight that can't get through the smog cloud. He soon has to leave as he can't even survive a few seconds under the cloud, but says he will be watching. Soon he tells Swift to go on ahead and inform the group that he is bringing the group. Soon she flies over more ruin till she reaches the dead body of the Carrier as it's baby universe was removed and it crashed into London. She flies through pacing groups of homeless now using the Carrier as a home as it is the only place relatively safe. She soon meets the Engineer however the EM pulses that shut down all machines have made her nanobots in active and in her human form. She seems to be using her intellect to manage and care for the people their telling Midnighter and Swift when they need to go for supplies seemingly acting as leader. As they talk a voice tell them that a <i>soul storm</i> is coming and Angie goes to get everyone ready. Soon Swift calls the voice Jack and it is revealed to be a deformed handicapped Jack Hawksmoor.",

Jenny has something the Nazis want: a Tibetan egg.<br /><br />1st January, 1913, Vienna. Jenny spends her birthday learning of her parent’s death on the Titanic. Without funds, her education in Vienna is over, but her godfather, Professor Einstein, has offered to educate her in Zurich.

Jenny takes her leave as Adolf ponders his future in politics.<br /><br />Germany, 1st January, 1943. Jenny is being held underground. The Nazis reveal that there is in fact a person inside the egg, a person the Tibetans had guarded for generations.

You'll never look at Jack Hawksmoor the same way again. <i>   </i></em></p> <p><em> <br /></em>A young boy plays with friends in a ballpark, then everything freezes. He knows what’s happening, as it has happened to him before.<br /><br />The boy's surroundings then shift; he is in a tank with alien devices surrounding him. Everything goes dark. He regains consciousness, and finds himself back in the ballpark, naked and covered in an alien substance.<br /><br />24th February 1976. Jenny is in Russia, speaking with scientists about a strange man held in a containment cube. The scientists inform her that the man in the cube is known as Jack Hawksmoor. For as long as Jack can remember, he has been abducted by aliens from the future. Their intention is to evolve Jack so that he can combat a lifeforce that has already obliterated the 70th Century. <br /><br />Jack is abducted once more whilst in the company of Jenny. Jenny enquires the scientists how often this occurs, ans is told it happens every couple of hours. The scientists are pessimistic over Jack's chances of survival. <br /><br />Jenny is taken from the lab into a hall filled with super beings who have been called in to help prevent the future threat from the 70th century. <br />Jenny is then told she was drafted to lead this army into battle.

Jack, now merged with the city, has turned it into a giant battle-suit. Jack uses Japan to smash Kansas to pieces. <br /><br />November 1976. One of Jenny’s demands is met: going forward, the scientists are unaware of Jack's location since the incident in the South Pacific.    </p>",

            "description": "<em>The relationship of Apollo and the Midnighter takes center stage as the miniseries continues. On the run from Henry Bendix early in their careers, Apollo and The Midnighter are living on the streets, tackling conspiracies which never make it to the papers. What was being air-lifted between the United States and England </em><em>for the UK's General Election campaign? And what does it all have to do with a drunken, screwed-up Jenny Sparks, shattered from her experiences as a super-hero in New York during the 1980s? </em><br /> <br />Jenny contemplates how being connected to the era has its pitfalls - for instance, her time during the 1980's. <br /><br />3rd June 1992. Apollo and Midnighter prepare to launch a covert strike on an air force base. Apollo grabs one of the officers and questions him about the children they have in custody, before dropping him from a great height when the officier reveals the truth about the children. <br />Apollo informs Midnighter of the scale of the abuse, and informs him they are heading for London. <br /><br />In London, Jenny has lunch with Princess Diana. After their lunch, Jenny encounters a man she hasn’t seen for years, Colonel Kirsan Pruzhany. Diana points out that she might have an idea as to why the Colonel is in London, and tips Jenny off to an event that is happening that night in East End. <br /><br />On Skywatch, Bendix speaks directly to Pruzhany about the plans he has in place. Pruzhany confirms the plan and Bendix congratulates him. Bendix asks the Colonel to pass on his well wishes to the Prime Minister. <br /><br />Apollo and Midnighter arrive in London and head straight for the East End. They enter an abandoned warehouse, and it becomes clear that they have walked straight into a trap. Pruxhany and Bendix reveal themselves to the incapacitated Apollo and Midnighter. Bendix address the two, informing them they were foolish to believe they could remain invisible from him. Bendix orders the troops to kill the Apollo and Midnighter.<br /><br />The lights in the room suddenly cut out. Through the use of night vision, the troops see a woman standing in the middle of the room. Jenny addresses Pruzhany, then electrocutes all of his troops. Midnighter takes advantage of the opportunity. He escapes and kills Pruzhany.<br /><br />Jenny briefly chats with Midnighter and Apollo. She then lights one of her trademark cigarettes and leaves.<br />",
